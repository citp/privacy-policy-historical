# Privacy Statement - Made with Vue.js

## At A Glance

**Who is responsible for the collection of data on madewithvuejs.com?**  
Nifty Software e.U. is responsible for the data collection and storage. Our contact data can be found in the [Imprint](https://web.archive.org/web/20190330162341id_/imprint).

**How do we collect your data?  **  
Primarily we collect data that you consciously give to us, f.ex. with subscribing to our newsletter, by sending us an e-mail to get your project added or by booking a package to feature your project.

Other data will be automatically collected when you visit madewithvuejs.com. These are mainly technical data like your browser, OS or the time of your visit. This happens automatically and helps us to see how we can improve our site. These data will never be linked to your personal data (like f.ex. your e-mail address that you gave us when subscribing to our newsletter). We can not (and do not want to) create a profile of you and your browsing habits.

To keep madewithvuejs.com alive, we also use Affiliate & Ad Services, that may store the timestamp of your visit, your IP-address and a cookie.

**How do we use your data?  **  
We use statistics to further develop our website and to make sure to be able to deliver it without issue. Your e-mail address will only be used to answer your questions, send you our newsletter (if you consciously signed up for it). Your personal and company data will only be used to create an invoice for purchased feature packages or provide the purchased services.

Some data will be processed by Third Parties. This is limited to our Newsletter Provider MailChimp (see 2 below), the tools we use to handle the purchase of feature packages (TypeForm and Stripe, see 1 below) and our Webspace Provider (Digital Ocean, see 1 below). We only share necessary data to provide a specific service with those parties (f.ex. only your e-mail address to send you a newsletter).

We will not share your data with any other third parties and we won't use it for anything else ourselves. If you personally write us an e-mail, your address will be handled only by us, confidentially.

**What are your rights?**  
You have the right to request information about origin, recipients and purpose of your data free of charge at any time. You can demand correction, locking or deletion of your data – just send us an informal e-mail.

In case we don’t comply with your request, you have the right to complain at the responsible regulating authority. Of course, it’s in our interest to guarantee your personal data privacy. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us.

We use the services of TypeForm (TYPEFORM, S.L., Bac de Roda 163, 08018 Barcelona, Spain) to provide you with a convenient way to book our feature packages. Data entered via our Booking Forms (master data, contact data) will be processed by them. These data will not be shared with other Third Party Services and are only accessible to us.

The payment within the TypeForm forms is handled via Stripe (see chapter External Payment Provider) and will not be stored by TypeForm.

You can consult their privacy policy for further information: <https://admin.typeform.com/to/dwk6gt>

**\- External Payment Provider**

### 2\. Newsletter

With our newsletter, we inform you about new and popular Vue.js projects on our site and other services related to our site.

If you want to receive our newsletter, we need a valid e-mail address. We also need information to ensure that you own the e-mail address with which you are subscribing / that the owner is consenting to receive our newsletter. Other data will not be saved. These data are only used for sending newsletters and will not be passed on to third parties.

With the subscription to our newsletter, we will store your IP address and the timestamp of your subscription. Storing this information is important to prove that the owner of the e-mail address gave his consent to receive our newsletter.

You can revoke your consent to our storing of your data and to receive our newsletter at any time free of charge. You can unsubscribe through a link in every issue of our newsletter, through managing your preferences in your profile or by sending us an informal request.

The distribution of our newsletters is carried out by “MailChimp”, a newsletter tool of the US company Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.

The e-mail addresses of our newsletter subscribers, as well as the data collected as described above, will be stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp is using this information to distribute and analyze our newsletters according to our orders. In addition, MailChimp is authorized to use our data to optimize and improve their services, f.ex. for the technical optimization of the distribution of newsletters. MailChimp is not using the data of our subscribers to send them newsletters about their services or to share them with third parties.

We trust in the reliability and the IT- and data security of MailChimp. MailChimp is certified under the US-EU-Data Privacy Convention “[Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG)” and is therefore obligated to comply with EU data privacy requirements. Furthermore, we closed a “[Data-Processing-Agreement](http://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/)” with MailChimp. This contract ensures that MailChimp is protecting the data of our users, to only process data at our orders and in accordance with their data privacy statement and especially not to share data with third parties. You can read the data privacy statement of MailChimp [on their website](http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

The newsletter issues contain a so-called „web-beacon“, which is a pixel-sized file that will be called by MailChimp’s servers upon opening the newsletter. Through this beacon, technical data like your browser and OS, as well as your IP address and the timestamp of you opening the newsletter can be accessed and stored by MailChimp. This information is used for the optimization and improvement of the service.

These data also include whether the newsletter has been opened, when it has been opened and which links got clicked. This information can be linked to the personal data of our subscribers for technical reasons, although it is not in our interest, nor in the interest of MailChimp to observe or analyze individual users. These statistics are used to gain insights into the preferences of our subscribers to provide them with content that is useful to them.
