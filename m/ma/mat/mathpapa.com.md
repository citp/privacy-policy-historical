This Privacy Policy describes how MathPapa collects, uses, discloses and secures information collected from or about you and your devices through the Service. By using the Service you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Services. MathPapa may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time in our sole discretion in accordance with the modification provision of the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms/).

### Log Files

The Service makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), anonymous identifiers, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, text inputs, and clicks to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users movement around the Service, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such anonymous identifiers are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. 

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to MathPapa's Service choose to interact with MathPapa in ways that require MathPapa to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MathPapa gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at MathPapa to provide a username, date of birth, and email address. Those who engage in financial transactions with MathPapa are asked to provide additional information, such as name and credit card number. In each case, MathPapa collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with MathPapa. MathPapa does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

When you download and use our Service, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").
