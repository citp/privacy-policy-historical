**_General Uses and Disclosures_**. Matilda Jane Clothing may use your Personal Information and Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, directly contacting you in response to your inquiries; processing your transactions and fulfilling your orders; sending you information about your orders, emailing you promotional materials, from which you may opt-out of receiving; researching the effectiveness of our marketing efforts; analyzing users’ browsing and usage activities and patterns in order to understand users’ interests and preferences with respect to our services and the Sites; conveying relevant information to our Trunk Keepers, and managing our everyday business needs. Matilda Jane Clothing supplements the Personal Information we collect with information from other sources to tailor our websites, products, and offerings to your needs

Matilda Jane Clothing uses Usage Information to enhance the content of our Sites to provide you with a better website browsing experience in the future, to respond to customer inquiries and suggestions, and to ensure that you are exposed to special offers and products that are of interest to you. We may also share this non-identifiable Usage Information with third parties from time to time for business purposes. 

Matilda Jane Clothing may disclose your Personal Information to third parties that may assist us with managing our daily operations, such as processing payments and providing general customer services. When you make a purchase on our website or via a Trunk Keeper, we request Personal Information—specifically, we request financial information, such as account or credit card numbers. We will use your financial information to bill you for products and services or otherwise process your transactions. By making a purchase on our website, you consent that we may provide your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine is necessary to process your transactions. These third parties may include the credit card processing company, our website provider, credit card network (such as Visa, American Express or Master Card) and banking institutions used to process the transaction.

Matilda Jane Clothing may also share your Personal Information with certain independent contractors, vendors, and suppliers with whom we contract to provide specific services and products related to our websites or our business, such as hosting and maintaining our websites, blog, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, operating activities on our behalf, authorizing credit card transactions, and developing applications for our Sites and email services. We limit our disclosure of your Personal Information to these third parties to the minimum information reasonably necessary for them to perform limited functions on our behalf. 

**_Opting Out of Email Communications._** If you have provided your email address to Matilda Jane Clothing, from time to time you will receive emails from us with information and offers from Matilda Jane Clothing and other companies that we feel would be of interest to you. With every commercial email, we will provide you with a link to opt-out from receiving future commercial emails. You may also opt-out of receiving future email messages from us by emailing us at CustomerCare@MatildaJaneClothing.com. Opt-out requests are usually handled as soon as the request is made. However, it may take up to ten (10) calendar days to process an opt-out request. If you wish to opt out from a communication sent by a specific Trunk Keeper, please reply to that Trunk Keeper with “Unsubscribe” in the subject line.

Because we want to ensure that those people who have opted out no longer receive commercial email from us, we may share the email addresses of our customers who have opted out of receiving commercial email with our trusted third-party advertising partners (such as Trunk Keepers) who engage in email marketing to their customers on our behalf. Therefore, we may share the email addresses of persons who have opted out with these third parties for the sole purpose of ensuring that the third parties have scrubbed their email marketing lists to remove the email addresses of those persons who have opted to no longer receive our commercial email announcements.

Please note that if you elect not to receive commercial email messages from us, we will continue to send you transactional related email, such as product recall information, safety or security information, subscription information, membership details, account status, order confirmations, shipping confirmations, invoices and customer-service related email.

Matilda Jane Clothing will not share your email address with any third party except as expressly set forth in this policy or unless you have requested or consented to such disclosure.

**_Opting Out of Offline Communications_**. When you provide Personal Information, such as your name, address and telephone number to us, we may use this information to contact you with correspondence and promotional offers from Matilda Jane Clothing. You always have the opportunity to choose to no longer receive these communications from us by emailing us at CustomerCare@MatildaJaneClothing.com.

**_Opting Out of Offline Communications From Other Companies_**. We will never share your Personal Information, such as your address and telephone number, with any third party, other than independent Trunk Keepers. If you wish to not receive postal mail from Trunk Keepers, please contact that Trunk Keeper directly using the information they provide.

**_Law Enforcement, Safety, and Legal Processes_.** We may share your Personal Information and/or Usage Information with law enforcement or other government officials if it relates to a criminal investigation or alleged criminal activity. We may also disclose specific Personal Information and/or Usage Information if required or permitted to do so by law, and we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law or protect and defend the interests or safety of Matilda Jane Clothing or its employees, our Trunk Keepers, other visitors to our Sites, or a member of the public. We may also disclose your information to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or legal process. 

**_Sale or Acquisition of Assets_**. In the extraordinary event we become involved in a transaction involving the sale of our assets, such as a merger or acquisition, or if the Sites are transferred to another company, we may disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information as part of the transaction. If we are not the surviving entity in that transaction, the surviving entity may use your Personal Information pursuant to its own privacy policies and practices, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.
