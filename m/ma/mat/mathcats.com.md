# math cats privacy policy

Math Cats respects your privacy. Math Cats complies with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

You may use online forms to send ideas, contest entries, pet stories, and number stories to Math Cats without using an e-mail address. Math Cats does not seek and will not post your last name (unless you and your parents specifically request that it be posted). If you include your e-mail address, it is used only once, to inform you when your contribution is posted. If you send an e-mail message to Math Cats, your address will be used only once to reply to your message. Messages posted in the Math Cats mailroom are edited to remove personal identifying information.

If you sign up to receive Math Cats News, your e-mail address will be used only to send new issues to you. 

If you are under the age of 13 and you wish to receive Math Cats News or to correspond more than once with Math Cats, you need to have a parent send an e-mail message to Math Cats giving permission for this.

Your name, e-mail address, and any other personal information will never be divulged to a third party.

Math Cats does not collect any addresses or phone numbers, with one small exception. If you are a winner in the monthly Math Cats' writing contest, then a message will be sent to the e-mail address supplied with your entry, asking your parent(s) three things:  
1) permission to post your full name, age, town, state, and country, along with your entry;  
2) permission for you to receive a prize or certificate; and  
3) the address to which the prize or certificate should be sent.  
Your mailing address will never be collected or used for any other reason. 

Math Cats does not use cookies.

Most links leading away from Math Cats to other educational sites and resources are located in the Grownup Cats' section of Math Cats. There are also links on the Awards page leading to the educational awarding sites. Math Cats takes care only to link to safe, educational sites.

There is only one human who has access to the information you send to Math Cats: Wendy Petti, the creator of Math Cats. 

Feel free to contact Math Cats if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.
