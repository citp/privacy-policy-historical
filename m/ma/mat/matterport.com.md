# Privacy Policy - Matterport

Last Updated: December 22, 2015

Please note that by using this website and the services available on this website (collectively, the “Site”) provided by Matterport, Inc. (“Matterport”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

### **What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?**

This Privacy Policy discloses our personal information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to the Site. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it. By visiting the Site, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

### **What information do we collect from users and how is it used?**

This section describes the types of personal information we may collect about you, and how we use that information. We use the personal information we collect to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us; to improve our services; to provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about; or to notify you about changes to our Site.

_Online Inquiries_. When you submit an inquiry via the Site, we may ask for your first and last name, physical address, email address, phone number, company name, industry type,  and certain other information from time to time. We request this information for identification purposes, and to communicate with you regarding your inquiry. If you provide your phone number, we may use that information to make direct dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, and to send text messages, from Matterport relating to our product and services.

_Correspondence_. If you correspond with us via email, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit.

_Images stored_.  When you capture imagery and submit it to the Matterport Portal (as described in the [Matterport Portal Subscription Agreement](http://matterport.com/terms-of-service/)), we may collect personal information which is depicted within the imagery you submit.  We do not use this incidental information for any purpose, but this information may be publicly displayed if you choose to display the underlying imagery publicly through the Matterport Portal.  If you do not wish to publicly display personal information depicted in the imagery you submit, you should either refrain from capturing such personal information in your imagery or designate the imagery as “private” in your Matterport Portal account.  For additional information on designating your imagery as “public” or “private”, restricting third parties from editing or re-sharing your imagery, and the consequences of  archiving your imagery, deleting your imagery and/or terminating your account, please also see the [Matterport Portal Subscription Agreement](http://matterport.com/terms-of-service/).  We will store your imagery for the longer of (i) the period of your subscription to the Matterport Portal or (ii) 10 years from the date of first import into the Matterport Portal.

_URL and IP addresses_. Like many other websites, we collect information about our users’ utilization and navigation of our Site. This information helps us to design our Site to better suit our users’ needs.

We will track the URL that you visited before you came to our Site, the URL to which you next go and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

_Information Collected With Cookies_. Like most websites, we also use cookies on certain pages of our Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets our Site remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities on our Site, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting our Site.

We may also use cookies: (i) to deliver content tailored to your interests, as further described below; or (ii) to relate your use of our Site to personal information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. If your browser is set to reject cookies, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the cookie were enabled. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze usage of our Site, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content, layout and services. If you have questions about type and purpose of cookies (our own and third party) that are used in connection with our Site, you may contact us by e-mail at info@matterport.com.

You can set your browser to either reject all cookies, to allow only “trusted” websites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from those websites you are currently on.  To learn how to delete or disable cookies in general, visit[www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies).

### **To whom we disclose information about you that we collect?**

Matterport will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose any of the personal information that we collect about you, except when we have your permission or in any of the following situations:

We disclose information that we collect about you to our third-party contractors who perform services for Matterport in connection with the Site and/or our business, or to complete or confirm a transaction that you conduct with us.

We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you for marketing or promotional purposes, as further described below. We may disclose information about you as part of a merger, acquisition or other sale or transfer of Matterport’s assets or business. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this Privacy Policy. We may be legally obligated to disclose information about you to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances, such as in connection with illegal activity in connection with our Site or to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process. We reserve the right to release information that we collect to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.

### **Where do we process your personal information?**

If you use the Site outside of the United States, information that we collect about you will be transferred to servers inside the United States, which may involve the transfer of information out of countries located in the European Economic Area. We may also use third party processors to process your data on our behalf who may be located anywhere in the world.  By allowing Matterport to collect information about you, you consent to such transfer and processing of your data.

### **How do we use online analytics services and tailored online marketing?**

On our Site, we use Google Analytics and other third-party web analytics services. These third-party services use the sort of technology described in the preceding sections to help us analyze how users use the Site, including by noting the URL that users visited before they came to our Site. These service providers will receive or directly collect the information collected by the technology, which they will use to evaluate your use of the Site. As described in the following paragraphs, we also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to online marketing. [You may click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics.

We also allow other third parties, such as Google Analytics and other ad networks and ad servers, to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site.  These tracking technologies enable these third parties to serve our tailored marketing to you while viewing other areas of the Internet, based on anonymous information collected while you are visiting our Site. We have implemented the following Google Analytics advertising features based on interests and location for the purposes of remarketing:  retargeting and enhanced demographic tracking, including affinity audiences, custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, similar audiences, demographic and location targeting, and demographics and interest reports. The parties that provide these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted marketing as described below. Click [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) for more information on how Google uses data when you use the Site.

You may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) to opt-out of receiving tailored marketing from companies that participate in those programs, and if you are interested in learning about tailored browser marketing and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing (i.e., not just for our Site). You may also visit the [Google Ads Settings page](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) to opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads. Please also see additional information [here](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/html/mobile-about.html) about Google Ad Settings for mobile apps.  Be aware that you may still receive marketing content that is not tailored to your interests, even if you opt-out of tailored marketing, to the extent marketing technology is integrated into our Site. In addition, we are not responsible for any choices you make using any of the above opt-out links, and we do not control these opt-out methods or their continued availability or accuracy.

You may also receive tailored in-application marketing content when using an application on a mobile device. Each mobile operating system provides its own instructions on how to prevent or opt-out of the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content.

### **California privacy disclosures.**

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions. In general, subject to certain exceptions, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide, free of charge, a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.  California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by sending an e-mail to info@matterport.com.

### **What security measures do we employ for the Site?**

To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through the Site, where personal information is requested, we use technology designed to encrypt the information that you input before it is sent to us. In addition, we take commercially reasonable steps to protect data that we collect through the Site against unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that the Site is run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### **How long do you retain personal information?**

Unless otherwise specifically stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

### **How can you correct or update information that we collect about you?**

You may correct or update information collected about you by contacting Matterport at the email or mailing address noted below. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct or update our records. For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting, and agreement enforcement.

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your personal information) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by contacting us at the email address below.

You have the right to access personal information about you.  We may request a fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you, as permitted by law.  We may decline to process requests that are frivolous, vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or not otherwise required by local law.

### **What are the policies of linked websites and other third parties?**

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of personal information collected from you by Matterport. You should be aware that when you are using the Site, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Matterport is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked websites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any third party website.

### **How will I know about changes in the Privacy Policy?**

Matterport reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, with such changes to be effective from the moment a revised Privacy Policy is posted on this Site. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be apprised of any changes.

### **What is our policy on children users of the Site?**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 18 years old, and no part of our Site is directed to persons under 18. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. If Matterport learns that personal information of persons less than 18 years old has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then Matterport will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 18 has obtained an account on the Site, then you may alert Matterport at the address below and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.

### **What law governs my use of the Site?**

By choosing to use the Site or otherwise provide information to Matterport, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the law of the State of California.
