# Privacy Policy - Matterport

Last Updated: March 1, 2017

Please note that, by using this website, the services available on this website, and the mobile and desktop applications, including virtual reality (“VR”) and augmented reality (“AR”) applications (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Matterport, Inc. (“Matterport”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services.

###  **What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?**

This Privacy Policy discloses our personal information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to the Services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it. By visiting and/or using the Services, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

###  **What information do we collect from users and how is it used?**

This section describes the types of personal information we may collect about you, and how we use that information. We use the personal information we collect to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us; to improve our services; to provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about; or to notify you about changes to our Services.

 _Online Inquiries._ When you submit an inquiry via the Services, we may ask for your first and last name, physical address, email address, phone number, company name, industry type, and certain other information from time to time. We request this information for identification purposes, and to communicate with you regarding your inquiry. If you provide your phone number, we may use that information to make direct dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, and to send text messages, from Matterport relating to our product and services.

 _Correspondence._ If you correspond with us via email, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit.

 _Images stored._ When you capture imagery and submit it to the Matterport Cloud (as described in the Matterport Cloud Subscription Agreement), we may collect personal information which is depicted within the imagery you submit. We do use this information in aggregated form for analytics and machine learning, but the results of these activities do not contain or disclose any personal information that is identifiable to you. We do not use this incidental information for any other purpose, but this information may be publicly displayed if you choose to display the underlying imagery publicly through the Matterport Cloud. If you do not wish to publicly display personal information depicted in the imagery you submit, you should either refrain from capturing such personal information in your imagery or designate the imagery as “private” in your Matterport Cloud account. For additional information on designating your imagery as “public” or “private”, restricting third parties from editing or re-sharing your imagery, and the consequences of archiving your imagery, deleting your imagery and/or terminating your account, please also see the Matterport Cloud Subscription Agreement. We will store your imagery for the longer of (i) the period of your subscription to the Matterport Cloud or (ii) 10 years from the date of first import into the Matterport Cloud.

 _URL, IP addresses, Device Information and Frequency of Use._ Like many other online service providers, we collect and analyze information about our users’ utilization and navigation of our Services. This information helps us to design our Services to better suit our users’ needs, and we also use this information to share aggregated, anonymous information on the effectiveness of our Services with content owners and creators.

We track and collect data about how frequently you use the Services, the time You spend actively using the Services, and the pattern of actions you take in using the Services, We also track the URL that you visited before you came to our Services, the URL to which you next go, information about the browser through which you are accessing the Services, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our Services and to administer our Services. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad location and demographic information.

Our mobile applications also track and provide to us data about the ID and make/model of the mobile device that runs the app. The mobile applications will track information when you are online, and may also track information when you are offline. 

_Information Collected With Cookies._ Like most online service providers, we also use cookies on certain pages of our Services. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets our Services remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities on our Services, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting our Services.

We may also use cookies: (i) to deliver content tailored to your interests, as further described below; or (ii) to relate your use of our Services to personal information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to our Services. If your browser is set to reject cookies, then your use of the Services may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the cookie were enabled. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze usage of our Services, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Services’ content, layout and services. If you have questions about type and purpose of cookies (our own and third party) that are used in connection with our Services, you may contact us by e-mail at info@matterport.com.

You can set your browser to reject all cookies, to allow only “trusted” websites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from those websites you are currently on. To learn how to delete or disable cookies in general, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

###  **To whom we disclose information about you that we collect?**

Matterport will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose any of the personal information that we collect about you, except when we have your permission or in any of the following situations:

We disclose information that we collect about you to our third-party contractors who perform services for Matterport in connection with the Services and/or our business, or to complete or confirm a transaction that you conduct with us. Unless you request otherwise, we require these contractors to use or disclose this information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by law.

We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you for marketing or promotional purposes, as further described below. We may disclose, to the owners of certain content available through the Services, or their representatives, the following types of aggregated data about usage of such content: the number of views and the number of users who view the content, statistical information about users who view the content by geography, the referring URLs of users who view the content, the number of users who interacted with the content in specific ways, and other similar aggregated information relating to usage of the content. We may also disclose to third parties certain algorithms developed from analytics and machine learning conducted on user information collected in aggregated form, but these algorithms do not contain or disclose any personal information that is identifiable to you.

We may disclose information about you as part of a bankruptcy, corporate reorganization, merger, acquisition or other sale or transfer of Matterport’s assets or business. 

We may be legally obligated to disclose information about you to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances, such as in connection with illegal activity in connection with our Services or to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process. We reserve the right to release information that we collect to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.

###  **Where do we process your personal information?**

If you use the Services outside of the United States, information that we collect about you will be transferred to servers inside the United States, which may involve the transfer of information out of other countries, including countries located in the European Economic Area. We may also use third party processors to process your data on our behalf who may be located anywhere in the world. By allowing Matterport to collect information about you, you consent to such transfer and processing of your data.

###  **How do we use online analytics services and tailored online marketing?**

In our Services, we use Google Analytics and other third-party web analytics services. These third-party services use the sort of technology described in the preceding sections to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the URL that users visited before they came to our Services. These service providers will receive or directly collect the information collected by the technology, which they will use to evaluate your use of the Services. As described in the following paragraphs, we also use Google Analytics on this website, and in the services available through this website (collectively, the “Site”) for certain purposes related to online marketing. [You may click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics on the Site.

We also allow other third parties, such as Google Analytics and other ad networks and ad servers, to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site. These tracking technologies enable these third parties to serve our tailored marketing to you while viewing other areas of the Internet, based on anonymous information collected while you are visiting our Site. We have implemented the following Google Analytics advertising features based on interests and location for the purposes of remarketing: retargeting and enhanced demographic tracking, including affinity audiences, custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, similar audiences, demographic and location targeting, and demographics and interest reports. The parties that provide these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted marketing as described below. Click [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) for more information on how Google uses data when you use the Site.

You may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) to opt-out of receiving tailored marketing from companies that participate in those programs, and if you are interested in learning about tailored browser marketing and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing (i.e., not just for our Site). You may also visit the [Google Ads Settings page](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) to opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads. Please also see additional information [here](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/html/mobile-about.html) about Google Ad Settings for mobile apps. Be aware that you may still receive marketing content that is not tailored to your interests, even if you opt-out of tailored marketing, to the extent marketing technology is integrated into our Site. In addition, we are not responsible for any choices you make using any of the above opt-out links, and we do not control these opt-out methods or their continued availability or accuracy.

You may also receive tailored in-application marketing content when using an application on a mobile device. Each mobile operating system provides its own instructions on how to prevent or opt-out of the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content. 

### **California privacy disclosures.**

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions. In general, subject to certain exceptions, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide, free of charge, a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by sending an e-mail to info@matterport.com.

###  **What security measures do we employ for the Services?**

To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through the Services, where personal information is requested, we use technology designed to encrypt the information that you input before it is sent to us. In addition, we take commercially reasonable steps to protect data that we collect through the Services against unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that the Services is run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

###  **How long do you retain personal information?**

Unless otherwise specifically stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

###  **How can you correct or update information that we collect about you?**

You may correct or update information collected about you by contacting Matterport at the email or mailing address noted below. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct or update our records. For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting, and agreement enforcement.

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by contacting us at the email address below.

You have the right to access personal information about you. We may request a fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you, as permitted by law. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous, vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or not otherwise required by local law.

###  **What are the policies of third-party websites, apps or services?**

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of personal information collected from you by Matterport. You should be aware that when you are using the Services, you may also use or be directed to other websites, applications or services of third parties that are beyond our control, and Matterport is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of their websites, applications or services. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any third party website, application or service.

###  **How will I know about changes in the Privacy Policy?**

Matterport reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, with such changes to be effective from the moment a revised Privacy Policy is posted on this website. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be apprised of any changes.

###  **What is our policy on children users of the Services?**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years old. Our Services are intended for use by a general audience, and no part of our Services is directed to children under 13. If Matterport learns that personal information of children less than 13 years old has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then Matterport will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an account on the Services or otherwise provided us with personal information without your consent, then you may alert Matterport at the address below and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.

###  **What law governs my use of the Services?**
