* ### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

**General**

Matchmove collects personal information when you register with Matchmove, when you use Matchmove products or services, when you visit Matchmove pages or the pages of certain Matchmove partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Matchmove may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we might also ask for your address, social security number, identification number, and information about your assets. When you register with Matchmove and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Matchmove collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer.

Matchmove automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Matchmove cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. Matchmove uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

* ### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Matchmove does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  1. We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Matchmove under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Matchmove communicate with you about offers from Matchmove and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

  2. We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing Matchmove to collect and use their child's information without consenting to Matchmove sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes.

  3. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

  4. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Matchmove's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

  5. We transfer information about you if Matchmove is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Matchmove will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Matchmove displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

  6. Matchmove does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

  7. Matchmove advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).




Matchmove works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.

* ### COOKIES

Matchmove may set and access Matchmove cookies on your computer. Matchmove lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Matchmove's cookies.

Matchmove uses web beacons to access Matchmove cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Matchmove products and services.

* ### YOUR ABILITY TO EDIT AND DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES

**General**

You can edit your Matchmove Account Information, including your marketing preferences, at any time. New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Matchmove service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Matchmove Newsletter, that are considered part of your Matchmove account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. You can delete your Matchmove account by visiting our Account Deletion page.

**Confidentiality and Security**

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.
