<h3><a name="privacy"></a><br>Privacy Statement</h3>
        mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.&nbsp; The following discloses our
        information gathering and dissemination practices for the <a href="http://www.mathsteacher.com" target="_blank">www.mathsteacher.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.mathsteacher.com.au" target="_blank">www.mathsteacher.com.au</a> Websites ("the mathsteacher Websites").
  <p>mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd may use technology to monitor traffic through the mathsteacher Websites to gather broad information about how
        visitors are using the mathsteacher Websites.&nbsp; This information is used to improve the experience for the visitors.</p>
        <p>The mathsteacher Websites may contain links to other Websites.&nbsp; mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd is not responsible for the privacy practices or
the content of such Websites.</p>
<p>The mathsteacher Websites direct visitors who request a licence from mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd for our software to order forms on the mathsteacher.com
Website.&nbsp; All information collected is necessary to fulfil our licensing process.&nbsp; We may use the information collected on the order
        form to verify the identity of the person requesting the licence to protect our company from fraudulent orders.&nbsp; Contact information from the order form is used to fulfil the order.&nbsp; The licensee's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary such as to inform the licensee of an unanticipated delay in fulfilling the delivery process.</p>
        <p>Internet orders require the processing of either MasterCard, VISA or American Express credit card details.&nbsp; mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd secures transactions with the Internet standard for encryption, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).&nbsp; SSL uses encryption to ensure all information shared
        between a computer and a Website is protected from outside observation or interference.&nbsp; After filling in an order form and pressing the
        "Pay by Credit Card" button, the credit card details are securely transmitted in real time to the National Australia Bank and
        processed behind its firewall.&nbsp; National Australia Bank approves or declines the credit card details in real time (in approximately 6 seconds).&nbsp;&nbsp; mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd will then process all approved transactions in accordance with its licensing process.&nbsp; For security reasons, the National Australia Bank does not provide mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd with full credit card details (i.e. only 9 of the 16 digits of the credit card number is provided).</p>
        <p>mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd may aggregate demographic information for internal use to analyse its performance.&nbsp; It will not share any information with third parties that could be used to identify individual users of the mathsteacher Websites.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the mathsteacher Websites may be provided with the opportunity to receive email updates about future software or reminders about licensing our software through check boxes or feedback forms.&nbsp; mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd requires you to willingly opt-in before receiving any such emails.</p>
<p>Use the mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd <a href="https://www.mathsteacher.com/secure/feedback.shtml" target="_blank">feedback form</a> to request removal of your information from our database to not receive future communications.</p>
<p>Visitors to the mathsteacher Websites may provide mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd with feedback through feedback forms.&nbsp; When providing such feedback, we require basic contact details including your name, email address and whether you are a teacher, parent, student, retailer or someone else.&nbsp; We may contact you
        to further clarify your feedback.&nbsp; mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd may aggregate the
        feedback information for internal use to analyse the broad viewpoints of
        the mathsteacher Websites' visitors.&nbsp; mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd
        will not share any
        feedback information with third parties
        that could be used to identify individual users of
        the mathsteacher Websites.</p>
        <p>If you wish to provide mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd with feedback, you
        must read the <a href="terms.htm">terms and conditions of use</a> of
        the mathsteacher Websites and in particular, the sub-section relating to intellectual
        property rights of <a href="terms.htm#Feedback Submissions">feedback submissions</a>.</p>

<p>Providing mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd agrees to license its software in accordance with the relevant licence agreement/s, it will send the software by post or Internet
download as requested.</p>
<p>mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd will aim to minimise the delivery time taken but may take such steps as deemed necessary to verify the payment of the licence fee and the identity of the person requesting the licence to protect itself from fraud.</p>
        <p>For schools and tutoring centres, mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd aims to ship the software to all customers within 24 hours of receiving the
        order.&nbsp; For Homework Licences sent by post, mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd will ship the software within the timeframe advised to customers before orders are
        submitted.&nbsp; However, longer delivery times might occur for customers in remote locations.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, before requesting a licence, you must accept that mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd does not
        guarantee the delivery time of the software and shall not be liable for any damages caused by late delivery to the user/s of the software, nor shall
        it be obligated in any way to alter the terms of the relevant licence agreement.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd will inform the person requesting the licence by using the email address provided by that person:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>of any expected delays in the delivery of the software.</li>
