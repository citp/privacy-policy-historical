			        Use of this site signifies your acceptance of the terms and conditions.<br>
			        <br>
			        Mattel, Inc. and its family of companies ("Mattel") are committed to protecting your online 
                    privacy when visiting a website operated by us.  We do not collect and keep any personal 
                    information online from you unless you volunteer it and you are 13 or older. We also do not 
                    collect and keep personal information online from children under the age of 13 without consent 
                    of a parent or legal guardian, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described 
                    in this policy. Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies 
                    on website privacy, so that you can take full advantage of all the fun activities available at
                     our sites for you and your family. Please remember that this site and the servers that make this 
                     site available are located in the U.S. By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, 
                     processing and use of data by this site.<br>
			        <br>
			        <b>A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS:</b><br>
			        Mattel adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the guidelines of the 
                    Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in each 
                    of our websites for children.  You can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring 
                    your children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to 
                    provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission.<br>
			        <br>
			        If you are under 18, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask 
                    questions about things you do not understand. Children under 13 should get your parent's or legal 
                    guardian's permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to Mattel 
                    or to anyone else on the Internet.<br>
			        <br>
			        <b>1. Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Me If I'm 13 Or Older?</b><br>
			       Mattel doesn't require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy 
                   any of our websites.  That means you can visit our sites without any need to register with us. However, most 
                   of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any 
                   personal information from you or your teenager unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when 
                   signing a guest book, registering for contests, sweepstakes, community areas, downloads, or free 
                   demos, completing our online customer surveys or purchasing products. The personal information we 
                   ask for is usually first and last name, mailing address, phone number and an e-mail address. See 
                   below for how we use this information. Remember, only people who are 18 or older may purchase 
                   products from our online stores.  In addition, only a parent or guardian can register children 
                   under age 13 to participate in enhanced subscription services or certain community features at 
                   our websites.  We may obtain customer lists, demographic and other information from other sources.  We 
                   may combine this information with information we collect online to better understand your 
                   needs, improve our site, products and services, and to better serve you.<br>
			        <br>
			        <b>2. What Ordering Information Does Mattel Collect In Our Online Stores?</b><br>
			        We may offer opportunities to purchase products in our online stores.  Customers must be over the age 
                    of 18 with a valid credit card.  Visitors under 18 can use the Wish List function while browsing our 
                    online stores but cannot make purchases.  When a customer places an order or requests a catalogue 
                    online, we collect information associated with the transaction, which will include the customer's 
                    name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping address, and credit card information.  We ask 
                    for this information so that we may fulfill the order or catalogue request.  We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
                    technology to protect credit card data during transmission to our website, and adopt careful internal 
                    procedures to safeguard this information in our system.  We require our service providers and vendors 
                    to safeguard the privacy of any personal information they handle and to adhere to industry-accepted best 
                    practices to safeguard personal information.<br>
			        <br>
			        Customers have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing their 
                    online order.  For the customers who choose to register, we will capture their login name, password, name 
                    and mailing address, alternate ship-to addresses, and credit card information.  Enhanced subscription 
                    services at some of our websites may be available to you or your child for a monthly or other fee.  To 
                    register your child, we will ask you to provide your child's screen or user name and password in addition 
                    to your contact details and credit card information so we can assist you in managing your child's account.  We 
                    may also offer you the option to be billed automatically for subscription service fees.  If you elect to 
                    automatically renew a subscription, we or our trusted service providers will retain your registration 
                    information, including your credit card information, so we can process your request.  <br>
			        <br>
			        When registered customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves 
                    with their login name and password.  If a customer includes a child's birth date and e-mail address, this 
                    information will only be used to help us provide products and services that meet customer needs.<br>
			        <br>
			       When a customer places an order online, we will send a confirming e-mail message.  We may also send an 
                   occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to customers.  Any 
                   customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional e-mail should indicate 
                   this preference on the online store order form.  If you do receive an e-mail from us that you would 
                   rather not receive, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions included in the e-mail.<br>
			        
                     <br>
			      When a customer places an order or registers on a site where transactions are handled by a third-party 
                  vendor, those transactions are conducted through the vendor's website.  You should be sure to review the 
                  vendor's website terms and conditions and privacy policy before submitting any personal information or 
                  engaging in any transactions through any third-party website, as Mattel is not responsible for any transactions 
                  made through third-party websites or for any content, terms and conditions, or privacy policies of such third-party websites.<br>
			        <br>
			        <b>3. Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Anyone Under 13?</b> <br>
			       We do not collect personal information online from children under 13 without consent of a parent or legal 
                   guardian except in special, limited circumstances. If your child is under 13 and wants to use our sites 
                   with special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages, games or clubs, we might ask your 
                   child to "register." They can often do so anonymously by just providing a user name and password, but 
                   sometimes we need their first name and e-mail address. When we ask for your child's first name, your 
                   child is encouraged to use a "screen name" (not their real name) that only they know. Sometimes we will 
                   ask your child to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the site. With 
                   your verifiable consent, we may collect personal information from your child such as a last name, address 
                   or e-mail address when the information is necessary for a particular activity. If we need more than just 
                   your child's first name (or screen name) and e-mail address for your child to participate in a particular 
                   online activity, we will ask your child for your e-mail or mailing address so that we can notify you of 
                   your child's request and get your permission. When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we 
                   will do with the information you or your child provides us, and we will tell you how you can review your 
                   child's information and ask us to delete the information. We don't keep your (or your child's) e-mail 
                   address unless you tell us it is okay.<br>
			        <br>
			       Mattel might collect an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) from your child under 13 without your 
                   consent, but only in the following special cases:
			        </p>
			        <ul class="Size10ColorGrey"><li>If a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep their e-mail address 
                    for long enough to respond to them. Mattel deletes this information from our system after we answer their question.</li>
			        <li>If a child under 13 signs up for an e-mail newsletter, or other activity that requires multiple online 
                    contacts with the child, we also ask the child for a parent's or legal guardian's e-mail 
                    address so we can notify you and give you an opportunity to opt out.</li>
			        <li>Occasionally, Mattel has special site activities or promotions like sweepstakes or contests 
                    that are open to children even if they are under 13. In these activities, we 
                    are not allowed to ask for more information from your child than what is 
                    necessary for your child to participate in the activity.  </li>
			        </ul>
			        <p class="Size10ColorGrey">
			       In the latter situation we require your child to give us your e-mail address, too, so 
                   that we can tell you that they have registered in a promotion or for a service. If we 
                   need more than an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) to enter your child 
                   in the promotion or offer the service, we will notify you, explain what information we 
                   need and why, and generally ask that you (not your child) provide it. For instance, we 
                   might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes 
                   your child wins, or for your telephone number so that we can tell you when your child has 
                   won. Any information you or your child give us in the above special circumstances will be 
                   deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any 
                   legally required period for keeping such information is complete.<br>
			        <br>
                    We may offer enhanced services available to children under 13.  In such cases, a 
                    parent must register for the service and establish the appropriate permission level for 
                    the child.  Content and activities available to you or your child may vary depending on 
                    the subscription and site.  Parents will be provided with information on the type of content 
                    and activities their child may access at the time they subscribe and are always in charge of 
                    their child's account.  Subscription fees may apply for some services.<br>
                    <br>
                    We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a 
                    contest, game or other activity as a condition of participation. If you no longer wish your child 
                    to participate in an e-mail newsletter, simply click on the link that is provided for removal 
                    or contact us at <a href="mailto:service@mattel.com">Service@mattel.com</a>.  Upon proper identification, parents or legal guardians may 
                    review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or 
                    refuse to allow further collection or use of the information.

			       However, if you ask us to delete your child's information, we may have to ask your 
                   child not to participate in our activities.<br>
			        <br>
			        <b>4. What Does Mattel Do With The Information We Collect?</b><br>
			        We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time you or your 
                    teenager or child (with your consent) provides such information. For instance, if you 
                    register in a contest, we will use the registration information to notify contest 
                    winners, or if you purchase a product, we will use the information to fulfill the 
                    order. Occasionally, and only with consent at the time we ask for information, we 
                    might also e-mail or mail you or your teenager or your child to provide information 
                    on upcoming Mattel products, website updates and promotions. With your consent, we may 
                    also share information with other Mattel brands and Mattel family companies so that 
                    they can let you and your family know about products that might be of interest. If you 
                    want to stop receiving such updates and product information at any time, just contact us 
                    at <a href="mailto:service@mattel.com">Service@mattel.com</a> or call us at 800-524-TOYS. Our 
                    mailings and e-mail will also include information allowing you to ask not to receive such 
                    information in the future.<br>
			        <br>
			        <b>5. Does Mattel Share Information About Me With Others?</b><br>
			        If you consent, Mattel may provide your information to outside companies that offer products 
                    or services that may be of interest, and if your teenager 13 or older consents, we 
                    may likewise provide their information. Except as described in this policy, we never 
                    share personal information that we receive online from children under 13 with other 
                    companies outside Mattel for their marketing purposes.  We will remove your name from 
                    the list we provide to outside companies if you contact us at <a href="mailto:service@mattel.com">Service@mattel.com</a> or call us 
                    at 800-524-TOYS, and we will do the same for your teenager's name if they request removal. In 
                    special circumstances, Mattel may give other companies access to our information database, but 
                    only if necessary to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security, manage 
                    transactions, help us process and fulfill orders or requests, or provide other similar services 
                    to Mattel. If we do provide access, we require those other companies to sign confidentiality 
                    agreements promising to keep secret any information they see. If Mattel believes that anyone's 
                    behavior on our sites may damage us or our sites or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant 
                    personal information in order to prevent this harm. In that case, we might try to identify the 
                    wrongdoer, contact them or bring legal action against them. We may also disclose personal
