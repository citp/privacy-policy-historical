Website Visitors  
Like most website operators, MateCat.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the time and date of each visitor request. MateCat.com purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MateCat.com visitors use its website. From time to time, MateCat.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Certain visitors to MateCat.com websites choose to interact with MateCat.com in ways that require MateCat.com to gather personally-identifying information.

MateCat.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
