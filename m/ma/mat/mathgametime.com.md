items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional  
items, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and  
the latest happenings on MathGameTime.com.

When we send you emails that include a link to the MathGameTime.com site,  
that link may contain an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to identify  
the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our  
content for that individual. Email Opt-out Users who no longer wish to  
receive our email updates or other notifications may opt-out of receiving  
these communications by following the instructions contained in the

Credit Card Processing Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party  
processor that receives credit card numbers and other personally identifying  
information only to verify credit card accounts and process transactions.  
Credit card security is an important aspect of the online experience. We  
ensure that our processor use encryption technology to keep your credit card  
information safe. To ensure that your information is even more secure, if we  
ever collect your credit card information, it will be stored for the  
duration of the transaction on a server that isn't accessible from the  
Internet. With whom do we share your information and for what purpose? Fila  
LLC does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information  
with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a  
service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the

with the co-sponsor(s). If we intend to share such information, you will be  
notified prior to the collection of that information. If you do not want  
your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow the  
transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion  
or contest.

We may also aggregate user information in a non-personally identifiable  
manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users  
more targeted advertising, products and services. We may contract with third  
parties to conduct research and marketing on our behalf. Such third parties  
will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Fila LLC and may  
not use any personally-identifiable information provided by us other than as  
expressly instructed by us and in strict compliance with the terms of this  
Privacy Policy. Some entities that have links on our site may collect

may not follow the same privacy policies as Fila LLC. For instance, if you

MathGameTime.com to an entirely different site. These links can also be from  
advertisers, content providers and/or partners who may use Math Game Time’s

What are “cookies” and “web beacons” and how do we use them? Our site may  
use “cookies” and “web beacons” to speed navigation, keep track of items,  
and provide you with custom-tailored services. A “web beacon” is an embedded  
GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific  
piece of content. We also use “cookies” to remember information you gave us  
so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. By showing us  
how and when visitors use the site, “cookies” and “web beacons” help us see  
which site areas and content are popular and which are not. We also collect  
IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information  
to any sponsors. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site  
may also use their own “cookies.” Most browsers are initially set to accept  
“cookies.” If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse “cookies.” You will  
not be able to use our service if you turn off the “cookies” option.

functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.  
However, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account  
information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and  
other factors may compromise the security of our member information at any  
time. Business transitions In the event Math Game Time goes through a
