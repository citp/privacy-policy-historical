# Privacy Policy | Mattamy Homes

This Privacy Policy has been prepared by Mattamy Homes (" **Mattamy** ", " **we** ", " **us** ", " **our** ") and sets out the manner in which Mattamy collects, uses, discloses and otherwise manages personal information.  The Privacy Policy also describes the privacy practices on the Mattamy website (the "Website") and through other interactions with consumers. 

## Collection and Use of Personal Information

**Guest Registry** : When you visit one of our sales centres and complete a Guest Registry form, we collect contact information such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address and mobile, work or home phone numbers. You may also choose to provide optional information such as your current housing situation, reason for moving, desired housing characteristics, family status, number of adults and children, age group and annual household income. We use the information provided on the Guest Registry form to better understand your needs, assist you in finding a suitable home and to send you tailored communications about Mattamy homes, products and services. We also use this information on an aggregate basis to better understand our customers and to improve our product and service offerings. 

**Buying a Home** :  When you complete an Agreement of Purchase and Sale for a residential property through Mattamy, we collect the information you provide on the Agreement including the first and last name and contact information (such as mailing address and telephone numbers) for each purchaser, real property description, and purchase amount.  We use this information for the purposes of facilitating the residential property transaction. We also collect information necessary to verify the identity of purchasers (such as a valid government-issued identification) as well as a personal cheque for deposit purposes.

**Requests for Mortgage Information** :  If you request information regarding the availability of home mortgage programs offered by Mattamy Home Funding in the United States, we collect your, and any co-borrower’s, personal information, including name, email address, employment and income, assets and liabilities, Social Security number and credit history.  Any information you provide in connection with your request for mortgage information will be forwarded directly to the appropriate Mattamy Home Funding affiliate, which will respond to your request or have a representative of Mattamy Home Funding contact you.  For additional information, please refer to the separate Privacy Policy for Mattamy Home Funding. 

**Warranty Registration and Requests** :  We collect certain personal information, including your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and property closing date when you register for a new home warranty plan or when you make a warranty customer care request.  This information is used to complete the warranty registration and to fulfill your request for warranty-related services.  

**Website Registration** :  In order to access information, products, and services on a password-protected area of our Website, we may request certain personal information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address and password that you select.  We use this registration information to provide and otherwise administer your online account or service you request. 

**Marketing Communications** :  When you complete a Guest Registry form or otherwise sign-up to receive information regarding Mattamy communities, homes, financial services and related products and services, we collect your contact information such as your name, mailing address, mobile, work or home telephone numbers and email address. We use the information you send you communications based on your interests by mail, email or telephone. You can opt-out of receiving future marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in our email communications or by contacting us as set out under “Contact Us” below.

**Referral Services/Tell-a-Friend** : If you choose to use one of our referral services to tell a friend about our Website or an employment opportunity, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will send your friend a one-¬time email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the site.  We store this information for the sole purposes of sending this one¬time email and tracking the success of our referral program, and we do not use the names or email addresses submitted in these circumstances for any other purpose without consent to do so. You are responsible for ensuring that you only submit email addresses of individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the message.

**Survey and Customer Research** :  From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys or other customer research. We may collect certain personal information such as your name and email address.  The information obtained through our surveys and customer research is used in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable form to help us understand our customers and to enhance our product and service offerings. 

**Customer Service** :  When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a telephone number) along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint (for example, lot number, warranty enrollment number, etc.).  We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and product and service offerings. We also use personal information to establish and manage our relationship with you and provide quality customer service. 

**Employment** :  In connection with a job application or related inquiry, you may provide us with certain personal information about yourself (such as that contained in a resume, cover letter, or similar employment-related materials).  This information will be used for the purpose of processing and responding to your application for current and future career opportunities.

##  Disclosure and Sharing of Personal Information

We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information, without your consent, except as otherwise set out herein.

**Sale of Business** :  Personal information may be provided to third parties in connection with a prospective or completed business transaction, including a merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Mattamy or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control.
