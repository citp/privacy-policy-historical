That includes making sure that the Portrait does not include any specific identifying information.

This ensures that no personal contact information is revealed until a member is ready to do so.</span></p>

               "personal information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact you 
               directly (without using the Site) such as full name, postal address, 
               phone number or email address), "financial information"

               personal information nor financial information; this may include, but

               subject to the rest of this paragraph.  Demographic information is divided

               history information and one-on-one communications between you and other users 
               of the Site; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other 
               demographic information.  We ask that you do not enter personal information 
               or financial information into your "Portrait" (for example, don't use your 
               address or passcode as your username, or include your name or address in 
               your written responses), because if you do then it may be posted 
               publicly on the Site, and the information will then be treated as 
               "demographic information" that is "public information."  
               Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect 
               personal information from children under the age of 18, as we 
               require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.

				When you sign in to this site using .NET Passport,

				called a "cookie." The use of this cookie allows you to

				to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal 
				information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member 
				of that demographic group.  Please also be aware that when we disclose your 
				financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded Company, as
