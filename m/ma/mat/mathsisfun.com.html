						<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing

              linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 
              For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not 
              have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while 
              on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our 
              site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
              in some areas of our site. Some of our partners use cookies on our 
              site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or 
              control over these cookies. Log Files: We use IP addresses to analyze 
              trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad 
              demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
              linked to personally identifiable information. Sharing: We will 
              share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
              This is not linked to any personal information that can identify 
              any individual person.
