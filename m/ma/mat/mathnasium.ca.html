<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 23, 2015</p>

<p>Mathnasium, LLC, a California limited liability company (“<strong>Mathnasium</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies and practices with respect to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information which you may provide while using, or that we may obtain from your use of, www.mathnasium.ca and/or http://mathnasiumfranchise.com/ (individually and collectively, the “<strong>Website</strong>”).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>

<p>By using the Website, you signify your consent to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or if you do not think this Privacy Policy provides you enough protection, you may not use or visit the Website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Non-Identifiable Information Automatically Collected</strong></p>

<p>Like many other websites, the Website may automatically collect certain non-identifiable information regarding Website visitors, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Website, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Website you visit, the Website pages read and images viewed, and the materials you post to or download from the Website. This non-identifiable information is used for Website and system administration purposes and to improve the Website. Your non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>The Website uses “cookies”, a technology that installs information on a website visitor’s computer to permit the website to recognize future visits using that computer. The cookies used by the Website do not contain any personal information regarding Website visitors, and do not retrieve any information from visitors’ personal computers (other than IP address and other similar information retrieved or retained in order to facilitate your use of the Website). Cookies are used only to enhance the visitor’s experience on the Website, and to collect anonymous traffic data to enable us to provide a better web experience for the viewing public in general. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain features of the Website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Information</strong></p>

<p>Mathnasium may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding Website user demographics and Website traffic patterns. This information helps us to customize the Website to better meet your online needs, improve our services and conduct research. None of the tracking information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual website visitors or other individuals. If Mathnasium links tracking information with personal information, any of the linked information will be treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
