</p></div></header><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-12"><p> The MathPapa web site and any related mobile applications (collectively, the "Service") constitute a hosted service operated by MathPapa, Inc. ("MathPapa"). This Privacy Policy describes how MathPapa collects, uses, discloses and secures information collected from or about you and your devices through the Service. By using the Service you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Services. MathPapa may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time in our sole discretion in accordance with the modification provision of the <a href="/terms/">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>. Your use of the Service following us posting a new Privacy Policy on the Service signifies that you agree to and accept the Privacy Policy as modified pursuant to the "Modifications of Terms" section of the Terms of Use.</p><p> This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected by the Service and how it is used and disclosed. </p><h3>Log Files</h3><p>The Service makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), anonymous identifiers, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, text inputs, and clicks to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users movement around the Service, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such anonymous identifiers are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. </p><h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3><p>
Certain visitors to MathPapa's Service choose to interact with MathPapa in ways that require MathPapa to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MathPapa gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at MathPapa to provide a username, date of birth, and email address. Those who engage in financial transactions with MathPapa are asked to provide additional information, such as name and credit card number. In each case, MathPapa collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with MathPapa. MathPapa does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p><p>
When you download and use our Service, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").
</p><p></p><h3>Analytics</h3>

MathPapa discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MathPapa's behalf or to provide services available on MathPapa's website and mobile applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MathPapa's website and mobile applications, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MathPapa will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MathPapa discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or when MathPapa believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MathPapa or third parties, the public at large or if MathPapa is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. If you are a registered user of a MathPapa website or mobile application and have supplied your email address, MathPapa may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with MathPapa and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
