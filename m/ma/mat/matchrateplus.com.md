MatchRatePLUS.com is committed to protect your privacy, and rigorous procedures have been implemented to ensure this. The following Privacy Policy provides information on how your personal information is collected and used.

**A. What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks:**  
MatchRatePLUS.com may offer several opportunities for visitors to register to become an Agent at no cost. Our site’s optional information requests forms that require your name, company, e-mail address, as well as information to help get your account created with us and our payment processor.

Information submitted by you within our website, will be used only by us in order to provide customer support to you, inform you of any new promotion or update of our website, provide to our partner processor, and/or to help you get enrolled as an Agent. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

We use this information to send updates about our company and will contact you if requested or necessary. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also track browser types to help us understand our visitors’ needs related to our website design. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. When you enter a contest or other promotional features we run for Agents from time to time, we ask for information such as your name, mailing address, daytime phone number and email address, so we can administer the contest and contact you to receive feedback regarding our product.

**B. Choice/Opt-out**  
There is no cost to become an Agent. You can can cancel by simply doing nothing or unsubscribing from our emails. If you sign up as Agent or Referral Partner, we request certain personally identifiable information from you. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and physical address). We use this information for promotion, contact, or support purposes.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter whether it is a promotional, support, or other related communication, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter.

We offer an opportunity to opt-out of promotional, support, and Agent related communication emails, by clicking on the unsubscribe link on the emails. Or, if it’s easier for you to write a letter to inform us that you’d like to unsubscribe from our newsletters, which will effectively remove you from MatchRatePLUS.com and our Agent program, you can write to us using a red crayon:
