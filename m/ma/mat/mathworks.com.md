## Privacy Policy for www.mathworks.com

At The MathWorks, we believe it is your right to know what information we collect, how we use it, and what your options are for its use. Below you can find details about:

  1. How we use and collect your information
  2. How we protect your order information
  3. How to remove or update your information
  4. How your information submitted to MATLAB Central may be used



### 1\. How we use and collect your information

We will not sell or rent your personal contact information to other companies. We will not disclose your personal contact information to other companies, except in the limited manner and for the limited purposes described below. The MathWorks Web site has several forms and additional collection methods that may require you to provide contact, payment, and other information. We use contact information to send promotional material about our company and products, and, in some cases, on behalf of related third-party products and services. If you have purchased our software or requested information, we may use this information to notify you of new products, updates, or other information related to your purchases. You may choose not to receive this additional information. (See "How to remove or update your information," below.)

The MathWorks uses current and past user information internally within The MathWorks and with its subsidiaries, partners, service providers, and authorized distributors in order to provide users with support, service, promotional and/or other product information. The MathWorks may release current or past user information to third parties for limited purposes in the event The MathWorks believes that usage is (i) in violation of the terms and conditions of use of The MathWorks Web site; (ii) used to commit unlawful acts; and/or (iii) is required to be disclosed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order. The MathWorks may also disclose aggregate information to third parties.

The MathWorks Store uses an order form to collect contact information and payment information (such as credit card numbers). The contact information is used to ship your order, to send you promotional material about our company, or, if necessary, to get in touch with you. The payment information is only used to bill you for the products you ordered or to process returns. (See "How we protect your order information" to learn how your privacy is protected during online transactions.) 

Important Note: The MathWorks Web site contains links to other sites such as universities and other businesses. If you visit one of those sites, please note that we do not control their privacy practices. Therefore, we urge you to learn about their privacy practices before leaving your contact information with them.

**IP addresses and cookies**. We use your IP address to administer our Web site and, occasionally, to help diagnose problems with our server.   We may use data collected in web server log files, JavaScript code, and cookies to analyze visitors’ behavior to better understand their needs. The MathWorks uses a third-party web traffic analysis company to log aggregate information coming through our site on our behalf. The MathWorks controls how that data may and may not be used.  We do not link this data to personally identifiable information, the data is used to analyze Web site traffic and navigation trends such as, but not limited to: your referring URL, the Internet browser being used, the type of operating system used, etc.  When you visit The MathWorks Web site and access “My Account” applications, one or more cookies may be placed on (or read from) your machine if your browser is set to accept cookies. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. These cookies do not store any personal information on your hard drive; they consist of a simple code that is used to access your account information, maintain current session data, gather broad demographic information, and to help analyze Web site traffic. The MathWorks may use such non-personal information for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, market research, and improving the content of our Web site.

Although Web browsers typically allow cookies by default, most browsers will let you modify settings so that you can decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of this web site or other Web sites you visit. 

### 2\. How we protect your information

The MathWorks Store has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the order information under our control. We use industry-standard security measures called SSL encryption. Encryption helps protect your credit card number and personal information by scrambling the data in transit to The MathWorks Store. We encrypt every order. If you would prefer to give your information by telephone, you may call 508-647-7000.

### 3\. How to remove your name from mailing lists and/or update your information
