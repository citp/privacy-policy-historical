**IP addresses and cookies**. We use your IP address to administer our Web site and, occasionally, to help diagnose problems with our server. We may use data collected in Web server log files, JavaScript code, and cookies to analyze visitors’ behavior to better understand their needs. When you visit the MathWorks Web site and access “My Account” applications, one or more cookies may be placed on (or read from) your machine if your browser is set to accept cookies. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser. These cookies do not store any personal information on your hard drive; they consist of a simple code that is used to access your account information, maintain current session data, gather broad demographic information, and help analyze Web site traffic. The MathWorks may use such non-personal information for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, market research and improving the content of our Web site.  
Although Web browsers typically allow cookies by default, most browsers will let you modify settings so that you can decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of this Web site or other Web sites you visit. 

The MathWorks engages a third-party Web traffic analysis company to log aggregate information coming through our Web site on our behalf. The MathWorks controls how that data may and may not be used. When you visit our Web site, the third-party Web traffic analysis company may use technical tracking methods such as cookies that will be listed under the domain 2o7.net, and Web beacons, on our behalf, and may receive anonymous information about your browsing on our Web site. These technical tracking methods are not used to relate Web site visitors to any personally identifiable information. Information collected by The MathWorks is unique to individual visitors but is not personally identifiable to the third-party Web traffic analysis company. Such information provided to The MathWorks may be re-associated by The MathWorks with previously collected information for internal purposes only, including but not limited to providing visitors with relevant content. We may also use these technical tracking methods in e-mails to determine whether the recipients have opened such e-mails, clicked on links contained in those e-mails, and continued to browse our Web site. No personally identifiable information, such as your name, street address, or e-mail address, is shared with the third-party Web traffic analysis company.

### 3\. How we protect your order information

[The MathWorks Store](https://web.archive.org/store/) has security measures in place to protect the order information under our control against loss, misuse, destruction, and alteration. We use industry-standard security measures called SSL encryption. Encryption helps protect your credit card number and personal information by scrambling the data in transit to the MathWorks Store. We encrypt every order. If you would prefer to give your information by phone, you may call 508-647-7000.
