Mature Dating Only (“Mature Dating Only”, “us” or “we”), has  created this privacy policy (hereinafter the “Privacy Policy”) in order  to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. We  understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy and have  designed our service with this in mind. You agree to this Privacy  Policy, in its entirety, when you: 1) access or use Mature Dating Only  (the “Website”); and/or 2) select and register for an offer(s) on the  Website by clicking the offer(s) presented. If you do not agree with the  terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, please do not use or access  the Website.<br>

<strong><br>
Information We Collect:</strong><br>
<br>
The information that we collect is generally limited to personal  information about you that you submit on the Website. The personally  identifiable information that may be collected includes: your name;  address; email address; telephone number; fax number; information about  your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services;  and education level and interests. Although we are not collecting credit  card information at this time, we reserve the right to do so in the  future. To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is  collected by Mature Dating Only and any of its affiliates and/or  subsidiaries, said information will be kept in confidence and will not  be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies)  without the customer's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Mature Dating Only and its affiliates and subsidiaries  reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that they have  credit card information on file for specific customers but they will not  share this credit card information with third parties without the  customer's prior informed consent.<br>
<br>
Like most standard website servers, we use log files. Log files  track anonymous user information including, but not limited to, Internet  Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider  (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and  number of clicks. This information is tracked in order to analyze  trends, administer the Website, track users' movements in the aggregate  and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The  information tracked via log files is not linked to personally  identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies:<br>
</strong><br>
The Website uses a “cookie” to assign a unique identifier to your  computer. The cookies we use are persistent files that your web browser  places on your computer's hard drive. Cookies may be used to help save  information on past activities and other preferences, so that you are  not required to reenter information each time that you visit the  Website, and to deliver content specific to your interests. No  personally identifiable information is gathered by the cookie.<br>
How We Use Your Information:<br>
<br>
Any personal information that you supply to us remains your personal  property. However, by submitting that information to Mature Dating Only  , you grant us the right to use your personal information for any legal  purpose including, without limitation: a) providing promotional offers  to you via email advertising and/or online banner advertising; b)  transferring the personal information that you provided to a third  party, when necessary, to receive a product, service, or information  that you may have requested from such third party while using the  Website; c) tracking compliance with our Terms and Conditions; and d)  for validation, suppression, content improvement and feedback purposes.<br>
