### Data Collection, Retention & Sharing

Data is collected and used for the sole purpose of facilitating the application/hiring process. The site only shares the application data with the employers where you have applied for positions, and we don't share them with any other employers or any other 3rd parties unless required by law. 

Applicants have the option on their coversheet form to remove their accounts and all files once all the jobs they've applied are finished, or they can remove their accounts right away if they don't have any current open applications. 

Applicant accounts including all related files in the Portfolio and reference letters will be automatically purged from the database 6 months (or 3 months if they have checked the 'off market' or 'remove my account' option on they coversheet form) after all jobs they have applied (if any) are finished, and they haven't logged in for 12 months. They can also contact us directly in case they need to remove their accounts quickly for some legitimate reason. 

Each employers can download all or any part of the application data submitted to their job openings to their local systems for any purposes they deem appropriate. Those downloaded data are no longer under our control, and they are governed by that employer's own policies. The application data will no longer be available or complete once the applicant accounts have been purged. The system keeps the snapshots online for 3 years. A historical copy of application listing (name, contact & degree info, application dates) and EEO data are available for 6 years before automatically removed.
