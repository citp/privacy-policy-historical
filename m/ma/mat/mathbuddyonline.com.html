          <p>PERSONAL  INFORMATION: Because of the nature of our product, we must collect  personal information from users during the registration process,  including (at minimum) first &amp; last names, email address and a  password. <br><br>
          Math Buddy LLC has partnered with Paypal for payment processing. When a user registers online for a free trial of the service,  they enter their credit card information using the secure payment gateway powered by PayPal. <br><br>
            The credit card information supplied with PayPal is used to  establish your subscription with us should you decide to continue the  service after the free trial has ended. <strong>Math Buddy LLC has no access to the credit card information entered by the user.</strong><br>
          <br>Your email address may be used  to send you periodic newsletters from Math Buddy LLC.  Users can opt out of promotional emails at anytime, but will still  receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and  customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the  service to you. We use the information collected to deliver services,  process payments, update our records, communicate with you about  products and services and generally maintain your accounts with us. <strong>We  do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third  parties for unknown reasons.</strong></p>
          <p>SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service  and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also  gather data about the usage of various features in Math Buddy. The gathered  information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience  possible when using Math Buddy. </p>
          <p>TRAFFIC  PATTERNS: We also track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our site.  However, we do not correlate this information with personally  identifiable data about individual users. We do track domain names,  browser types and MIME type. Such information will not be passed to  third parties without your prior consent unless where required by  applicable law.</p>
          <p>COOKIES: A cookie is a small data file that  certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We use  cookies to track user scores from activities and also hold some information about sessions. We do not store  passwords or any Personal Information about you in the cookies.</p>
          <p>We  continuously improve our Web sites and utilize different Web analytic  tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our Web  sites, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. The  Web beacons used in connection with our Web analytics services do not  share any personally identifiable information about our Web site  visitors with third parties. Our tools may gather data such as what  browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, and what  content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or  registering for services at one of our Web sites. This information is  used solely to assist Math Buddy LLC in maintaining a more effective and  useful Web site for our customers.</p>
          <p>Math Buddy LLC  also partners with selected marketing companies to help  us track the effectiveness of our Web ssites, generate visitor traffic,  and as part of our affiliate referral programs.  When a partner refers a visitor to us from any of these sites, they set  a Web beacon and a cookie on our site. An ad ID and a partner ID are  stored in the cookie, but no personally identifiable information  specific to the actual visitor is stored. Math Buddy LLC does not see  the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results  in a request to the partner's servers from the customer browser. We  have no control over their use of the cookie after it is placed on our  site.</p>
