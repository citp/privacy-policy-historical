<p><b>4. Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information.</b><br>
  At MATCHBIN we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third 
  parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. The following 
  describes some of the ways in which your personal information may be disclosed 
  in the normal course of business as we provide our users with our services.</p>
<p>MATCHBIN Trade Network. After registration, every member has the ability to 
  determine the extent to which they would like their personal information shared 
  on the Trade Network. Members may choose to keep all of their personal information 
  private (except mandatory-shared information such as user screen name, city, 
  state, country) or share all of their personal information. Your mandatory-shared 
  information is displayed throughout the Network and is therefore available to 
  the public. Your personal information that is optional to share is: first name, 
  last name, address, postal code, phone number, and email address. You do not 
  have to share your optional personal information on the network. Also, your 
  user name and password are never displayed to the public. However, you have 
  the ability to change your password if necessary. The Privacy Options section 
  of a member’s account is the place where changes to personal information 
  can be made. It has been the policy of MATCHBIN for users to freely trade amongst 
  themselves without interference from us. We encourage the free flow of information 
  (including personal information) in order for trade negotiations to be completed.</p>
<p>When a member opens a trade negotiation with another user, the system sends 
  an internal message to that user indicating that the initiating member has a 
  trade offer. Both initiating member and potential trade user receive sufficient 
  personal information to either proceed or terminate with the trade negotiation. 
  Trade negotiations are never monitored by MATCHBIN or its affiliated trade partners 
  and all personal information is strictly between the two (or in some cases three) 
  negotiating parties.</p>
<p>MATCHBIN "Talk" and "Meet" Venues. As with the MATCHBIN 
  Trade Network, every member has the ability to determine the extent to which 
  they would like their personal information shared on the "Talk" Venue 
  and/or the "Meet" Venue on the MATCHBIN.com site. The Privacy Options 
  section of a member’s account is the place where changes to personal information 
  can be made. Should a member choose to send personal information, of any kind, 
  whether it be information contained in the "personal information" 
  section of the member account page or any other personal information that the 
  member deems to share with other members on the MATCHBIN network; member holds 
  MATCHBIN Inc harmless and releases MATCHBIN Inc from consequences of dissemination 
  of personal information sent freely by member. MATCHBIN Inc has no control over 
  personal information disseminated other than such personal information contained 
  on the member’s "personal information" section of the members 
  account page.</p>
<p><b>Internal Service Providers</b>. We may use third parties to help facilitate 
  certain aspects of our business that we provide for you and therefore we may 
  provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service 
  providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements 
  with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information 
  we provide them for any other purpose or reason other than the specific service 
  they are providing for us. If you provide additional information to an internal 
  service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is regulated 
  by their applicable privacy policy.</p>
<p><b>Legal Requests</b>. Due to subpoenas, court orders, government regulations 
  and our rights to defend against legal claims, we cannot ensure that all of 
  your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed 
  in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Although we strive to 
  protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, nor should you expect, that your 
  personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
<p><b>5. Knowledge and use of other users’ information. </b><br>
  Because our service allows users to freely exchange information with one another, 
  by entering into our Member Agreement, you agree, with respect to other users’ 
  personal information that you obtain through the MATCHBIN.com site or any of 
  our affiliated partner sites, that MATCHBIN Inc hereby grants to you a license 
  to use such information only for: (a) MATCHBIN or affiliated partner related 
  communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, and (b) any other 
  purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you 
  would like to use it for. Under no circumstances, except as defined in this 
  section, can you disclose information about another user to any third party 
  without the consent of that user. You agree that other users may use your personal 
  information to communicate with you in accordance with this section. You agree 
  to give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review 
  what information you may have collected about them. MATCHBIN and its affiliated 
  partners will not tolerate Spam. You are not licensed to add a MATCHBIN or affiliated 
  partner user or member, even a user who has purchased an item or service from 
  you, to your mailing list without their express consent.</p>
<p><b>6. Control of your Password</b>.<br>
  You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. We 
  recommend that you do not disclose your User ID or password to any third parties. 
  Should you share your User ID and password or your personal information with 
  third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account. 
  We recommend that you review any third party Privacy Policies. If your password 
  has been compromised, you should immediately change your password. If you lose 
  control of your password you may lose control of your personal information and 
  may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.</p>
<p><b>7. Changing your Personal Information.</b><br>
  We give you the ability to review and change the personal information you have 
  submitted to us. This is done by logging into any MATCHBIN powered site and 
  entering your new information. Generally, MATCHBIN will not modify your personal 
  information because it is very difficult to authenticate your account manually. 
  We recommend that you promptly update your personal information if it changes 
  or is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, including contact information, 
  billing information, and shipping information, from our active databases. To 
  make this request, email us at support@matchbin.com. Such information will be 
  deactivated as soon as reasonably possible. However, we retain in our files 
  some personal information you have requested to be removed to prevent fraud, 
  assist with any investigations, enforce our policies and comply with any legal 
  requirements as permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all 
  of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in 
  response to your request. However, such personal information will be deactivated 
  from public and member viewing.</p>
<p><b>8. Security.</b><br>
  Your personal information is stored on MATCHBIN servers located in the United 
  States of America. We use a variety of safeguards to protect your personal information 
  against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access, including encryption, 
  "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. However, 100% totally secure 
  and safe protection does not exist on the Internet.</p>
<p><b>9. Notice of Policy Amendment.</b><br>
  We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the 
  amended terms on the MATCHBIN.com and/or affiliated partner sites. All amended 
  terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted.<br>
