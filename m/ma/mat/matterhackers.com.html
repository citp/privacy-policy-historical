          <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <p>The effective date of this policy is February 1, 2012.</p>
            <p>MatterHackers, Inc. (the "Company," "we," or "us") created this Privacy Policy for the Web site <b>www.matterhackers.com</b> (the "Site").  We want shoppers and other visitors to our Site to know how we use and share their information.  We describe that in this policy.  Our current operations are intended for users located solely in the United States of America (USA). So, this policy applies only if you are using our Site in the USA.  If we expand operations in the future outside the USA, we will develop a privacy policy at that time to apply to those operations.</p>

               <p>This Privacy Policy will inform you of the categories of personally identifiable information we collect, categories of third parties with whom the information may be shared, the choices you have to review and request changes to the your personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p2>What is "Personal Information?"</p2><p>The phrases "personally identifiable information" and "personal information" mean any information that permits you to be contacted physically or online such as your first and last name, physical address, email address, telephone number, or other identifying information maintained in combination with any of the foregoing.</p>
               <p2>What Personal Information Do we Collect about You?</p2><p>When you visit the Site or communicate with us via the Site or email, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
               <ul class="legal">
                <li>Automatic Information:</li>
                <li2>We may automatically track and collect the internet domain address, domain server, type of computer and type of web browser used to visit our Site. That type of information (often referred to as traffic data) will remain anonymous and is not considered personal information until you voluntarily tell us personally identifiable information that is combined with the traffic data. Traffic data helps us analyze how the Site is used and is helpful for analyzing usage of the Site and improving your experience on the Site.</li2>

                <li>Cookies:</li>
                <li2>Like many Web sites, we use computer "cookies," which are small amounts of data that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. We collect the information in the cookie when you visit the Site. The cookies enable our systems to recognize you, provide features to you, track your visits and sales, process your orders and/or analyze your use of the Site.  We may use cookies to provide you with personalized advertisements.  You may be able to set your browser to reject cookies or to ask you whether to accept a particular cookie. There are also third party utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. If as a result of your settings we cannot recognize you, we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at our Site, for example, you will be required to re-enter personal information each time you place an order, instead of being automatically recognized.</li2>
                <li>Information You Give Us:</li>
                <li2>We receive personal information from you when you fill out an online form (such as when you subscribe to emails or newsletters, request a catalog or other information, register to receive catalogs or other information or participate in a promotion or contest), place an order, or create or amend your profile on the Site or give it to us in any other way.  At such times, you may provide us with information about you such as your name, physical address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, age, income, credit card and other billing information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests or hobbies, etc. It is completely your choice whether to provide this information. But, if you choose not to provide some or all of the information, you may be unable to purchase products, receive newsletters, catalogs or other information or access other services, features or content on the Site.  We may also maintain a record of your purchases at and other transactions with the Site.</li2>
                <li>E-mail Communications:</li>
                <li2>We may maintain all or portions of e-mails that you send to our staff or company e-mail accounts, and may combine that information with other information. To help us with our e-mail initiatives, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail that we send to you, if your computer supports such capabilities.</li2>

                <li>Information from Other Sources:</li>
                <li2>We may sometimes receive personal information about you from other sources such as suppliers, couriers, or other companies and add it to your personal information in our records.</li2>
            </ul>
