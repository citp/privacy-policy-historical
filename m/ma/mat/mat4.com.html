<font size="2">PRIVACY POLICY </font>
<p><font size="2">Last Updated: March 14th 2007</font></p>
<p><font size="2">SEO UK Ltd. strives to offer its visitors the many advantages 
  of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. 
  We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street 
  address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will 
  never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. 
  Period."</font></p>
<p><font size="2">How we gather information from users</font></p>
<p><font size="2">How we collect and store information depends on the page you 
  are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
  provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 
  for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such 
  as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when 
  you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, 
  and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, SEO UK Ltd. 
  also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools 
  that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
  your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
  hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your 
  user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information 
  each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular 
  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we 
  may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
  not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse 
  to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions 
  of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we 
  may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">What we do with the information we collect</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance 
  your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect 
  your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
  identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
  about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users 
  to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited 
  most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally 
  be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
  does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
  anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
  SEO UK Ltd. to communicate with you about your registration and customization 
  preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products 
  offered by SEO UK Ltd. and other topics we think you might find of interest. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Personally Identifiable Information collected by SEO UK Ltd. may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration 
  of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third 
  parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information 
  only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop 
  our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. 
  In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. 
  We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
  times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection 
  with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
  authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may 
  not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</font></p>
<p><font size="2">SEO UK Ltd. expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates 
  to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
  including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
  accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 
  policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link 
  to, or view as part of a frame on a SEO UK Ltd. page, certain content 
  that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through SEO UK Ltd. you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, 
  features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. SEO UK Ltd. 
  is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should 
  check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing 
  information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or 
  other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify 
  some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some 
  of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable 
  the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement 
  before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by 
  third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
  SEO UK Ltd. does not control the use of this technology by third parties 
  or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies 
  of such third parties.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information 
  can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without 
  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals 
  or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of SEO UK Ltd. 
  and this policy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Children</font></p>
<p><font size="2">SEO UK Ltd. does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally 
  Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted 
  by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 
  in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If 
  you believe SEO UK Ltd. has any information from or about anyone under 
  13, please contact us at the address listed below.</font></p>
