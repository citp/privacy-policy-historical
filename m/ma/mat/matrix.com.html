        Matrix has adopted this Privacy Statement in order to inform you of its 
        policies with respect to information collected from this website. Your 
        use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement 
        and your consent to the practices it describes. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/info_collected.gif" alt="Information Collected"><br>
        Automatic Collection of Anonymous Information<br>
        When you visit the Matrix website, like when you visit most other websites, 
        certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, 
        which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server 
        name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as “aol.com” 
        or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access the site, the pages 
        you access while at the Matrix website, and the internet address of the 
        website, if any, from which you linked directly to the Matrix site. This 
        information is not personally identifiable. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/personally_ident.gif" alt="Personally Identifiable Information" width="219" height="15"> 
        <br>
        Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you 
        individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your 
        name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address 
        or any information you submitted to matrix.com that identifies you individually. 
        <br>
        <br>
        matrix.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about 
        you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want matrix.com to 
        obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit 
        it. <br>
        <br>
        You can visit and browse the Matrix website without revealing personally 
        identifiable information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose 
        personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained 
        as described below. matrix.com may collect personally identifiable information 
        about you from its website by methods such as the following: 
      </p><blockquote> <em>Registration Forms</em> – If you are offered the opportunity 
        to enter a promotion, to become a registered user of the Matrix website, 
        or to opt-in to receive Matrix information through another site, you must 
        apply by filling out the registration form on the site. This form requires 
        certain personally identifiable information that may include, without 
        limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, 
        areas of interest, product usage, and/or a unique individual password. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Transactions and Activity</em> – If you become a registered user or 
        if you conduct transactions through the Matrix website, matrix.com collects 
        information about the transactions you engage in while on the website 
        and your other activity on the site. This information may include, without 
        limitation, areas of the website that you visit, transaction type, content 
        that you view, download or submit, transaction amount, payment, shipping 
        and billing information as well as the nature, quantity and price of the 
        goods or services you exchange and the individuals or entities with whom 
        you communicate or transact business. <br>
        <br>
        <em>Email and other voluntary communications</em> – You may also choose 
        to communicate with matrix.com through email, via our website, by telephone, 
        in writing, or though other means. We collect the information in these 
        communications, and such information may be personally identifiable.</blockquote>
      <br> <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/information_use.gif" width="114" height="15"> 
      <br>
      matrix.com may use the personally identifiable information collected through 
      its website primarily for such purposes as: 
      <blockquote> • helping to establish and verify the identity of users;<br>
        • opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts 
        or memberships;<br>
        • processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related 
        communications;<br>
        • providing services and support to users;<br>
        • improving the website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;<br>
        • providing users with product or service updates, promotional notices 
        and offers, and other information about Matrix and its affiliates;<br>
        • responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions; 
        <br>
        • maintaining the security and integrity of its systems. </blockquote>
      matrix.com uses the anonymous browsing information collected automatically 
      by its servers primarily to help it administer and improve its website. 
      matrix.com may also use aggregated anonymous information to provide information 
      about its website to advertisers, potential business partners and other 
      unaffiliated entities. Again, this information is not personally identifiable. 
      <br> <br> <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/disclosure.gif" alt="Disclosure of Information" width="219" height="15"><br>
      matrix.com does not provide personally identifiable information to unaffiliated 
      third parties for their use in marketing directly to you. Matrix may use 
      unaffiliated companies to help it maintain and operate its website or for 
      other reasons related to the operation of its business, and those companies 
      may receive your personally identifiable information for that purpose. Matrix 
      may also disclose personally identifiable information about you in connection 
      with legal requirements, such as in response to an authorized subpoena, 
      governmental request or investigation, or as otherwise permitted by law. 
      Finally, as Matrix’s business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets, 
      and in such transactions customer information may be one of the transferred 
      business assets. If Matrix, its internet businesses, or substantially all 
      of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets 
      transferred. <br> <br> <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/childrens_privacy.gif" alt="Children's Privacy" width="114" height="15"><br>
      This website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 13 
      or older. matrix.com will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain 
      accounts or memberships for, any child whom matrix.com knows to be under 
      the age of 13. matrix.com does not solicit or knowingly collect personally 
      identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If matrix.com 
      nevertheless discovers that it has received personally identifiable information 
      from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom Matrix otherwise 
      has reason to believe is, under the age of 13, matrix.com will delete such 
      information from its systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian 
      may request that the child’s information be corrected or deleted from matrix.com’s 
      files by contacting us at <a href="mailto:vbarrera@matrix.com">vbarrera@matrix.com</a>. 
      <br> <br> <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/cookies.gif" alt="Cookies and Advertisers" width="219" height="15"><br>
      The Matrix website’s server, or the servers of companies that are used to 
      operate this site, may place a “cookie” on your computer in order to allow 
      you to use the website and to personalize your experience. <br> <br>
      A “cookie” is a small piece of data that can be sent by a web server to

      between sessions. The information collected from cookies may also be used 
      to improve the functionality of the website. <br> <br>
      The advertisers and/or other content providers that may appear on this website 
      may also use cookies that are not sent by the Matrix website. Such ads or

      encourages you to read the privacy statements provided by other websites 
      before you provide personally identifiable information to them. <br> <br> 
      <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/security.gif" alt="Security" width="114" height="15"><br>
      matrix.com maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to 
      help guard personally identifiable information. If transactions are offered 
      on the site, transaction information is transmitted to and from matrix.com

      to help protect such information from interception. matrix.com restricts 
      authorized access to your personal information to those persons who have 
      a legitimate purpose to know that information to provide products or services 
      to you and those persons you have authorized to have access to such information. 
      Please be aware, however, that any email or other transmission you send 
      through the internet cannot be completely protected against unauthorized 
      interception. <br> <br> <img src="../images/en/about_matrix/choice.gif" alt="Choice/Opt-Out" width="114" height="15"><br>
      In order to provide service to you, matrix.com will send you communications 
      related to your transactions, security or the administration of its website.
