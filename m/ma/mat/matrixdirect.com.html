We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information. Our employee access to information about our customers is limited to people who need access to do their jobs.</p>
<h2><br>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We get most of the information we need from customer applications and other forms. If a customer authorizes it, we may get information from others. We may obtain information as we process customer transactions. If you provide information to AIG Direct regarding other individuals, you agree: (a) to inform the individual about the content of this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable Privacy Notice provided to you; and (b) to obtain any legally-required consent of information about the individual in accordance with this Privacy Policy and other Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>For example, when a person applies for life insurance we may ask for permission to get information from insurance support organizations such as the Medical Information Bureau and consumer reporting agencies. We may also obtain information as we process customer transactions. The information we collect through our Web site and offline includes:</p>
<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h3>
<p>such as Name, Date of Birth, Telephone Number, Email Address, Social Security Number and Demographic Data.</p>

<p>such as Medical History and other factors affecting insurability.</p>
<h2><br>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We use the information for business purposes, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>contacting you regarding the products or services in which you have expressed an interest.</li>
<li>processing applications and claims,</li>
<li>servicing your business,</li>
<li>responding to your questions and concerns,</li>
<li>improving our Web site and marketing efforts, and</li>
<li>offering you other products and services.</li>
</ul>
<h2><br>INFORMATION SHARING</h2>
<p>We share the information with others who provide services to help us process or administer our business.</p>
<p>We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>with medical examiners who help us underwrite life insurance applications</li>
<li>with service providers such as third parties who help us process claims or print our customer statements, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, and an employment company to assist us with our hiring. We require that our service providers limit their use of the information and keep it confidential, and will share the personal information you provide only as necessary for the third party to provide that service</li>
<li>when we have the customer's prior permission</li>
<li>when we are allowed or required by law to disclose it, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, or</li>
<li>if AIG Direct is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share information with other companies to offer customers other financial products and financial services that may be of interest to them.</p>
<p>However, you have the right to tell us that you do not want us to share any information with these companies. This right is known as the right to "opt out." You may opt out at any time by sending us a written request to the address below. Even if you opt out we may still disclose information as allowed or required by law.</p>
<p>We will not share information with anyone else unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have the customer's permission, or</li>
<li>we are allowed or required by law to disclose it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the global nature of our business, for the purposes set out above we may transfer information to parties located in other countries. We may transfer information internationally to our group companies, service providers, business partners and governmental or public authorities. By providing information through our on-line services, and/or by sending a communication to an AIG Direct Company e-mail address, you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing disclosure and transfer of such information in the United States and other countries or territories, which may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Further, please note that any communication you send to an AIG Direct Company e-mail address will be routed through the United States.</p>
<h2><br>How Can I Unsubscribe From AIG Direct Communications?</h2>
<p>We will occasionally send you newsletters and information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. We will use your name and email address to send these emails to you.</p>
<p>You may unsubscribe or opt out of these communications at any time by sending us a written request or by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the email communications you receive. Even if you unsubscribe we may still disclose information as allowed or required by law.</p>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not unsubscribe from these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<h2><br>How Does AIG Direct Keep My Social Security Number Safe?</h2>
<p>It is the policy of AIG Direct to protect customer and employee Social Security Numbers that we collect in the course of our business as confidential. This includes maintaining physical and electronic security procedures to guard against unauthorized access to Social Security Numbers. We also limit access to Social Security Numbers, by among other means, only granting access to Social Security Numbers to our employees who use that information to perform their job-related duties. In addition, we do not disclose Social Security Numbers to third parties, except where required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2><br>Do We Collect Information About Children?</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from our site about children under the age of 13. We request that persons under the age of 18 not use our site without supervision from a responsible adult. If a child whom we know to be under the age of 13 sends personal information to us online, we will delete their personal information immediately.</p>

<h2><br>Will I Be Notified of Privacy Policy Changes?</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Web site. Access to those changes will be presented via a link on our homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email or postal mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of receiving communication from AIG Direct then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.</p>

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<h2><br>How Is Information Used for Customer Reviews?</h2>
<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in reviews conducted via email. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these reviews is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>We use this information to evaluate our level of customer service. With your consent we may post your reviews on our Web site along with your name. If you want your review removed please contact us at Client.Services@aigdirect.com.</p>
<p>We use a third party service provider to conduct these reviews; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a review with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<h2><br>Is this Web Site Secure?</h2>
<p>This Web site takes precaution to protect our users' information. Access to users' information is restricted in our offices, and we follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an agent or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, send an email to Client.Services@aigdirect.com.</p>
<h2><br>Am I Protected When Linking to Other Sites?</h2>
<p>This Web site may from time to time contain links to other Web sites, banner ads or advertisements (which in turn may link to other locations) for the convenience of users in locating information and services that may be of interest. If you use these linked Web sites or advertisements, you may leave this site and go to Web sites that we do not control. If you decide to visit these Web sites or advertisers, you do so at your own risk and it is your responsibility to read and comply with the privacy policies on those Web sites. Your right to privacy on a linked site is limited to whatever rights are provided to you by the owner of the linked site.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only applies to this site. This site only includes its home page and pages hereunder operated by AIG Direct. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any linked site, any site provided by a third party or any site provided by American General Life Insurance Company or its affiliates. You must consult the privacy policy of each site, particularly at any sites provided by third parties, in order to determine what information about you is collected and how that information is used.
