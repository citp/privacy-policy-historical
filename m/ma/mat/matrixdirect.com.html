	<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
	<p>Protecting the privacy of information about our customers is important. This
		notice tells you how we treat information about our current and former
		customers.
	</p>
	<p>
	We do not sell information about our customers. We maintain physical,
	electronic and procedural safeguards to protect it. Access to information about
	our customers is limited to people who need access to do their jobs.
	</p><p>
	We get most of the information we need from customer applications and other
	forms. If a customer authorizes it, we may get information from others.
	</p><p>
		For example, when a person applies for life insurance we may ask for permission
		to get information from
</p><ul>
			<li>
				Insurance support organizations such as the Medical Information Bureau and</li>
			<li>
				Consumer reporting agencies.
			</li>
</ul>
	<p>
		We also get information as we process customer transactions.
		<br>
	The information we may have includes:
	</p><p>
		CUSTOMER INFORMATION
		<br>
	such as Name, Address, Telephone Number, and Demographic Data.
	</p><p>
		FINANCIAL INFORMATION
		<br>
	such as Credit History, Income, Assets, and Other Insurance Products.
	</p><p>
		HEALTH INFORMATION
		<br>
	such as Medical history and other factors affecting insurability.
	</p><p>
		We use the information for business purposes, such as
</p><ul>
			<li>
				processing applications and claims,</li>
			<li>
				servicing your business, and</li>
			<li>
				offering you other products and services.
			</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	We share the information with others who provide services to help us process or
	administer our business.
	</p><p>
		For example, we may share information with
</p><ul>
			<li>
				a company that prints our customer statements,</li>
			<li>
				medical examiners who help us underwrite life insurance applications,</li>
			<li>
				service providers who help us process claims.
			</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	We require that our service providers limit their use of the information and
	keep it confidential.
	</p><p>
	We may share Customer Information with our affiliated companies to offer
	customers other products and services that may be of interest to them. (By law
	a customer cannot limit sharing of this information among affiliated
	companies.)
	</p><p>
	In most states, we may share Customer Information with companies not affiliated
	with us so that those companies, such as insurance or financial service
	companies, may also offer you financial products and services. However, you
	have the right to tell us that you don't want us to share any information with
	these companies. This right is known as the right to “opt out.”
	</p><p>
		We do not share Customer Information about our customers who live in Montana,
		New Mexico, or Vermont with any non-affiliated companies for marketing
		purposes, so residents of those states do not need to opt-out.
		<br>
		<br>
	You may opt out at any time by sending us a written request. Even if you opt
	out we may still disclose information as allowed or required by law.
	</p><p>
		We will not share information with anyone else unless
</p><ul>
			<li>
				we have your permission, or</li>
			<li>
				we are allowed or required by law to disclose it.
			</li>
</ul>
		<h2><span class="bold"> Notification of Changes</span></h2>
		<p>
		This policy effective 09-09-04. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we
		will post those changes on our Web site. Access to those changes will be
		presented via a link on our homepage and other places we deem appropriate so
		our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
		under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in
		accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
		If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in
		a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify
		users via email or postal mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not
		we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted
		out of receiving communication from Matrix Direct Insurance Services Inc., then
		they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this
		new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy
		practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database,
		we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.</p>

		<h2>
			Information Collection on the Web
		</h2>
		<p>
		Matrix Direct Insurance Services Inc. is the sole owner of the information
		collected on matrixdirect.com. Matrix Direct collects information from our
		users at several different points on our Web site.</p>
		<h2>
			<br>
			Cookies</h2>
		<p>
		A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information
		about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally
		identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and
		persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser,
		the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored
		on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can
		be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If users reject
		the cookie, they may still use our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track
		and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
		</p>
		<h2>
			<br>
			Third Party Cookies and Action Tags</h2>
		<p>We may also use a service that collects data remotely by using web beacons or tags embedded in our site's content. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, e-mail address, or any other contact information. We share this information with other AIG companies and with our third party vendor, Visual Sciences Inc. Visual Sciences Inc. gives us reports of this aggregated, anonymous data. We use this data to improve our site by responding to our users' interests and providing more relevant and useful information. To learn more about Visual Sciences Inc.'s privacy standards and use of web beacons, please visit: 
		<a href=" http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html." target="_blank">http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html</a>.
		</p><h2><br>
			Links</h2>
		<p>
		This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Matrix
		Direct insurance Services, are not responsible for the privacy practices of
		such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site
		and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects
		personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
		information collected by this Web site.
		</p><h2>
			<br>
			Log Files
		</h2>
		<p>
		Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet
		protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
		referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to
		analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate,
		and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc.
		are not linked to personally identifiable information.
		</p><h2>
			<br>
			Security</h2>
	<p>
	This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
	users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is
	protected both online and off-line. When our quote request form asks users to
	enter sensitive information (such health information), that information is
	encrypted and is protected with 128 bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption
	software. While on a secure page, such as our quote request form, the lock icon
	on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
	Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just
	'surfing'.
	</p><p>
		While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
		everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
		information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted
		in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific
		job (for example, an agent or a customer service representative) are granted
		access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are
		kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as
		any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded
		about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our
		users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally
		identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. If
		users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an
		email to <a href="mailto:customerservice2@matrixdirect.com">customerservice2@matrixdirect.com</a>.</p>
