# Privacy Policy

We agree with Google when they state that complete privacy does not exist except in a desert, and anyone who is not a hermit must expect and endure the ordinary incidents of the internet community of which he or she is a part.  
We hate spam. We strive to provide the best possible experience for our customers. The information we collect through our sites is used only to protect us and our customers and to improve our service. We will never rent, sell or trade your data in exchange for cookies, sweeties or anything.  
In spite of our extraordinarily stringent precautionary measures, no one’s private information is 100% safe, not with our company or any other company.

### Collection of Information

The only information that we require of you in order for you to use our services is an email address. You can choose to provide further information for your convenience. We collect all information submitted, including email addresses, phone numbers, and visitors’ IP addresses. We store cookies.  
Please do not submit private information to us. We do not require it, and we will never ask for it.

### Use of Information

All information collected throughout the site is used only to deal with our customers. If you have subscribed to a newsletter, you will receive the newsletter. If we stored a cookie, we will use this cookie solely to identify you and your web preferences. Any information sent to us will be used only within the company and never shared with any other company or organization.

### Third Parties
