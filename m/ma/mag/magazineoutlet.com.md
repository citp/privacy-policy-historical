**Order & Registration**

We request information from you on our order forms and when you register. This information is used for order fulfillment, billing, customer service, and to understand your areas of interest. You must provide delivery information and when applicable, your account number and type in order for us to fulfill your order. You may also be asked to supply a password that gives you access to your profile and order information.

To do so, we use a technology called clear GIFs, which automatically and securely transfer the information you enter. In the future, we may use other similar technologies on the site for the same purpose. If we do so, we will modify our privacy policy accordingly. See the "Notification of Changes" section below. 

**Network Advertising**

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on other sites.
