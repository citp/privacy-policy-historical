Privacy Policy

Last Updated February 2015 

This privacy statement explains the privacy practices of Magisto for users of the Site. If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Magisto Terms of Service, which are available at http://www.magisto.com/tos 

### Magisto's Commitment to Privacy

Magisto respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains Magisto's policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you. 

### What is Personal Information?

"Personal Information" is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. 

### Collection of Personal Information

We collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you register to use the Site or Services; post or submit any content on the Site or Services, including any video or audio content; or contact us for any reason. We may automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Services, such as your computer’s IP address, operating system, the site from which you linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, and activities. We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with Magisto. 

### Use of Personal Information

You can contact us at any time to decline promotional information (see under the heading “Choice” below). We may use subcontractors that are located in countries other than your own, and send them Personal Information (or other information) we receive, including videos or parts thereof. For example, we may send your information, videos or parts thereof to any countries outside the United States, Canada or the European Union for processing or storage. All our subcontractors will be subject to non-disclosure obligations. 

### Sharing of Personal Information

Summaries and edits of video produced by the Site and the Services will be made available to you via an internet link made available to you, including without limitation by email. You should not reveal this link or send this email to third parties. If you reveal this link or send this email to third parties, such third parties will have full access to such summarized and edited videos as well as any confidential or personal information on such video. As such, you should have no expectation of confidentiality in videos or other material if you have revealed the applicable link to third parties. Magisto also provides you with the choice of labeling your videos as “private” or “public”, with “public” as the default option. If your videos are labeled “public”, you should have no expectation of privacy in such videos. Magisto may post “public” videos to a publicly available feed or otherwise provide such “public” videos to third parties.

Magisto is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, which you disclose in such venues. 

### Other Disclosures
