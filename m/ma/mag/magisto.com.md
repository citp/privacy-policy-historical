Privacy Policy

Last Updated March 2011 

This privacy statement explains the privacy practices of SightEra for users of the Site. **** If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the SightEra Terms of Service, which are available at [http://www.magisto.com/tos](https://web.archive.org/tos)

## SightEra's Commitment to Privacy

SightEra respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains SightEra's policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you.

## What is Personal Information?

"Personal Information" is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. 

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.

## Collection of Personal Information

We collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you:

register to use the Site or Services;

post or submit any content on the Site or Services, including any video or audio content; or

contact us for any reason.

We may automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Services, such as your computer's IP address, operating system, the site from which you linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, and activities. **** We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with SightEra. 

## Use of Personal Information

The Personal Information we collect is used to process your requests or transactions, to provide you high quality service, to customize your use of the Site or Services according to your preferences, and to tell you about specific goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.  If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline promotional information (see under the heading "Choice" below). ** __**

## Sharing of Personal Information

SightEra does not sell, rent, share, or disclose Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described in this statement. 

Videos

Summaries and edits of video produced by the Site and the Services will be made available to you via an internet link made available to you, including without limitation by email. You should not reveal this link or send this email to third parties. If you reveal this link or send this email to third parties, such third parties will have full access to such summarized and edited videos as well as any confidential or personal information on such video. As such, you should have no expectation of confidentiality in videos or other material if you have revealed the applicable link to third parties. 

Communities __

If you use any of the features of the Site or Services, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public, even without your knowledge or authorization. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information, including Personal Information, in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes. SightEra is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, which you disclose in such venues.

## Other Disclosures

In addition, we may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SightEra, our customers, or the public.  Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.

## Protection of Personal Information

SightEra has put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access.

Account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. If other people have access to your email, they may be able to obtain access to your password and obtain personal information about you (such as your credit card information), or change information about your user profile. You may not want to use an email account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such email accounts.

## Use of the Site by Children

SightEra does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and you must be 13 years of age or older in order to establish an account. Parents are able to set up accounts for their children. In this way verifiable parental consent is required in order to register a child under the age of 13 to be enrolled, and any parent setting up an account for his or her hereby represents and warrants that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of such child, and has the authority to provide information and render consents on behalf of such child. In the event you become aware that an individual under the age of 13 has enrolled without parental permission, please advise us immediately. ** __**

## Online Links to Other Sites

SightEra members or users can link to other webs of third parties that provide useful information, or who have agreed to offer goods and services to SightEra members.
