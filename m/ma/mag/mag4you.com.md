# Mag4you.com Privacy Policy

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the web sites owned and/or managed by Mag4you.com Online Magazine., our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of our web sites you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. We may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers/clients and/or we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our Site/s.

**What other information do you request?**

We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about seminars, etc.). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent. 

If you sign up for a forum or service, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums/service. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum/service, nor is it used to identify you outside the network in any way. 

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. 

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**
