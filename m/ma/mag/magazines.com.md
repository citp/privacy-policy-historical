**Our Privacy Guarantee**   
Your privacy on the Internet is extremely important to us. And at MAGAZINES.com, we are committed to protecting this privacy. 

**Disclosing Information To Others**   
We do not distribute, sell, or rent your name or personal information to any third party, and will never do so without your permission. 

Occasionally, we conduct user surveys to better target our content, titles, and services to our audience. The information we collect is used for internal review, to improve the content of our web site, and is then discarded. It is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. 

**Mailings**   
From time to time we may ask if you are interested in receiving information about MAGAZINES.com, new titles, promotions, and other events. If you decline, you will not receive any newsletters or promotional emails from us. Those who voluntarily choose to receive our newsletter or any promotional mailings may remove themselves at any time by following the instructions included in each mailing. 

**Cookies**   
We do not use cookies to collect any personal information (cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to record movements within web sites). 

**Tracking**   
We do use tracking software to observe user traffic patterns throughout our site. But we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Tracking information is used only to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like, and how well each page performs on behalf of our guests. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

We also monitor search terms and titles entered at our site as a means of knowing what interests our customers. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 

**Security**   
When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. And all customer data we receive is protected against unauthorized access. 

**In Summary**   
We are committed to protecting your privacy, and use the information obtained from this site only to enhance your shopping experience at MAGAZINES.com. If you ever have any questions about what information we collect and how we use it, please contact us through our [online request form](http://www.magazines.com/ncom/mag/help/contactus.html?id=2492595362799) or send email to [ feedback@magazines.com](mailto:feedback@magazines.com).
