Last Modified: September 01, 2016

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we link to it from our home page and other pages of our web site.

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email Address
  * Phone number
  * Credit/Debit Card Information
  * Demographic Information

#### Emails from Magazines.com

As a Magazines.com customer you will receive special offers, coupons, and exclusive gift cards via email. If you prefer not to receive promotional emails from us you can easily manage your email preferences. In every promotional email we send, there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. Click the link, and after your request is processed you will no longer receive promotional emails.

**Note:** Even if you choose to not receive some marketing emails from us, you will still receive our transactional email, such as messages relating to the status of your order, or information about your account.

  


#### The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete the order. It is necessary to furnish this information to our third party fulfillment partners, such as magazine publishers, in order to quickly fulfill your order, as well as in connection with the processing of credit card payments. For email addresses specifically, Magazines.com does not share this information with other parties, except when you purchase a digital magazine subscription and your email address is required to authenticate that digital subscription with the magazine publisher. Because your information is shared with our third party fulfillment partners, the information is governed by the privacy policies of the recipients of the information. We also use the information to provide you with information about our other products and services and in an effort to provide you with a superior customer experience, including using information to develop personalized shopping experiences and histories for customers in order to customize products, promotions, emails, updates or special offers.

We also employ third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services. During the purchase process, at the time of checkout we may share your information (other than email addresses) with such service providers or intermediaries to help identify offers for products and services from other parties that may be of interest to you. This information is not further provided to advertisers or other third parties without your consent, and in the event such service providers or intermediaries obtain any personal information during that process, it will not be used by them other than in the performance of their services for us. We may also employ third parties to analyze our sales data or to assist in marketing and personalizing product information.

  


#### Disclosure to Other Third Parties

It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from governmental authorities - for Magazines.com to disclose certain of the information you have provided us to applicable third parties. We may also disclose this information if we determine that for purposes of law enforcement or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose this information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms of service or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale of Magazines.com, we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

  


#### Cookies

Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to record movements within web sites. We use cookies for web site optimization reasons, but do not use cookies to collect any personal information. We also use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on other websites. To opt-out of our data collection for targeted advertising on other sites, click here to [Opt Out Now](http://webmedia.magazines.com/optout.html).

  


#### Tracking

We do use tracking software to observe user traffic patterns throughout our site. But we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Tracking information is used only to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like, and how well each page performs on behalf of our guests. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We also monitor search terms and titles entered at our site as a means of knowing what interests our customers; however, we do not track which terms a particular user enters.

  


#### Security

When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. And all customer data we receive is protected against unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

  


#### Fair Credit Billing Act

The safety of every online transaction is important to us. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

  


#### How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us through our toll-free number at 1-800-MAGAZINES (1-800-624-2946). We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

  


#### Changes to Privacy Policy

Magazines.com reserves the right to modify or amend this privacy policy at any time. It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page, and the date this policy was last revised is identified at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
