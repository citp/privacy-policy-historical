We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms & Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. 

**Use of Cookies at our Website**

* * *

MagicBid uses so-called "cookies", which are files that are stored on your computer that can be retrieved to assist in customizing your experience with the online service. The information saved supports the functionality of the site, for example, by keeping track of your visual preferences or controlling the frequency of "pop-up" windows. You are free to prevent cookies from being saved on your hard drive by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. However, turning off these settings may result in limited functionality. 

**Security Measures**

* * *

Your MagicBid account and profile and the information contained therein are password protected. Please note that you are not permitted to provide your password to anyone else. MagicBid will never ask for your password in e-mail or over the phone. Please remember to log out of your account and to close your Internet browser window when you leave the MagicBid site; this is especially important if you use a PC in public locations. We assume no liability for the abuse of login data and passwords used.  
MagicBid treats data as an asset that must be highly protected. We use security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

**Protection from Web Crawlers or Spam**

MagicBid assures you that we will use your e-mail address with your express consent only for the purposes stated in the Terms & Conditions. We will not rent or sell your e-mail address to third parties, and we will prevent your e-mail address from being recorded by "web crawlers" or "web spiders" to the best of our ability. If you believe that your e-mail address has been recorded in this way, please email us at support@MagicBid.com immediately.
