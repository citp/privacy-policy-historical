Other security safeguards include but are not limited to multifactor authentication, data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.

We would like to caution our visitors about phishing attacks, wherein unscrupulous third parties seek to extract sensitive and confidential information from you by posing as a genuine website or by sending an email misrepresenting it to be from a genuine source.

If you receive such a message claiming to be from Magic Software, then please do not reply to it and immediately bring it to our attention by contacting the Webmaster.

Magic Software also recognizes the receipt, transmission or distribution of spam emails (unsolicited bulk emails) as a major concern and has taken reasonable measures, to minimize the transmission and effect of spam emails in its computing environment.
