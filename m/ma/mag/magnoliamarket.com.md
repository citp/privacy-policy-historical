We work with certain third parties for advertising or promotional purposes, including to: conduct special events; serve advertisements across the Internet; track and categorize your activity and interests over time on our websites and mobile applications, and on third-party websites and mobile applications; and to identify the different devices you use to access websites and mobile applications.  We may share your information with these third parties as described in this Policy, and these third parties may collect information from you independently as described in their privacy policies. The information that these companies collect or that we share may be used to customize or personalize the advertisements that are displayed to you.  

We may share personal information with the third parties we work with for advertising purposes; however, we generally do not share personal information about you with third parties for third-party marketing or advertising purposes. We may also share aggregate information, such as demographic information, and our statistical analyses, to third parties in our discretion.  This aggregate information does not include your personal information. 

We may also share your personal information with third-party providers that perform services for us.  For example, our web store is hosted by Shopify Inc.  We share your personal information with service providers such as Shopify in order to provide our website and products and services to you. Any credit card or bank account information you provide our websites will not be stored on our servers, and is instead passed directly to the third-party provider.  When we work with a third-party provider, we require that these parties agree to process your personal information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and applicable laws. 

Please remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. If you choose to use our websites, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which our third-party providers or their facilities are located.

For example, our websites provide social network posting and sharing buttons that allow you to post links to our content on your social network pages. When you click on these buttons or other links on our websites, the third party operating the linked site may be collecting information about your browser, device, and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy policies.

**Information You Post to Our Websites**

Applicable law may require that you authorize a third party to share your personal information with us before we can acquire it. 

**SECTION 4 – HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We take reasonable physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect the personal information collected on our websites. Of course, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards. However, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you provide us won’t be intercepted during transmission over the Internet.

**SECTION 10  – INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM NON-U.S. RESIDENTS **

If you are located outside the United States, please note that you may be transferring your personal information to a country that does not have the same data protection laws as your home country.  For personal information received from the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland, Magnolia is committed to handling your personal information in accordance with this Policy and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (or the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, as the case may be), as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, and to view Magnolia’s certification, please visit: [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

Magnolia’s accountability for personal information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Magnolia remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third parties engaged by Magnolia process the personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Magnolia proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

As further explained in the "Questions and Contact Information" section below, we encourage you to contact us should you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint.

We welcome your feedback and questions about this Policy. If for any reason you wish to contact us, please send us an [email](mailto:shop@magnoliamarket.com).

Any complaints will be resolved internally in accordance with our complaints procedures.

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
