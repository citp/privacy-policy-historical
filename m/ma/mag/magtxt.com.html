This statement of privacy covers how magTXT treats personal information collected and received, including information relating to the past use of our services. &quot;Personal Information&quot; refers to information that personally identifies you by your name, email address or phone number and other information that is not otherwise available publicly. This statement of privacy applies only to the practices of magTXT and the people we employ or manage. Other websites or services linked to/from this website will have their own statements of privacy which can be viewed on their respective privacy links.&nbsp;


Privacy Policy&nbsp;
We at magTXT, have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the magTXT Website. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on 5th of August 2012. Each time you visit the site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.&nbsp;


Your IP Address&nbsp;
Each time you visit the site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the site for you and to diagnose problems with our site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.&nbsp;


Cookies&nbsp;
magTXT may use cookies (a small file placed on your computer’s hard drive) that enables us to collect information which pages you find useful and which you do not.&nbsp;
Cookies are also needed for login and registration. magTXT and other third parties such as our advertisers may also use cookies to serve ads to you based on your visit to our website.&nbsp;
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. To opt out of Google’s use of cookies, please visit Google ad and content network privacy policy.&nbsp;
Third party advertisers on the site may also place or read cookies on your browser. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the site.&nbsp;
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our website as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.&nbsp;
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.&nbsp;


DoubleClick DART Cookies&nbsp;
magTXT also use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer’s hard drive when you are browsing this website using DoubleClick advertising such as Google Adsense advertisements.&nbsp;
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (“interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history. DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your bank account numbers or credit card numbers and etc. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all websites using this advertising by visiting http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.&nbsp;


Information We Collect From You&nbsp;
In order to operate the site and to provide you with information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect &quot;personal information&quot;, &quot;financial information&quot; or &quot;demographic information&quot;, subject to the rest of this paragraph. We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into your profile, because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the site, and the information will then be treated as &quot;demographic information&quot; that is &quot;public information.&quot; Please note that nowhere on the site do we knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.&nbsp;


Information Other websites Collect From You&nbsp;
On the site, we place links to other websites operated by other parties. Some of these other websites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other websites or these other websites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other websites. Consequently, the operators of these other websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.&nbsp;


How We Use Personal Information&nbsp;
We use your personal information to help us efficiently operate the site, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the site including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship with magTXT, and to forward messages to you from other magTXT users. These types of communications, are known as &quot;Operational Communications.&quot; In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner advertisements and special offers.&nbsp;

By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the site, or electing to receive communications or electing to participate in contests, or other reward programs, offered or sponsored by third parties on the site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.&nbsp;

In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages of the site. These pages are known as &quot;Co-Branded Pages&quot; and these companies are known as Co-Branded Companies. If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party, such as the advertising company Avenue A, may use to read cookies that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other (non-magTXT) web sites before your visit to magTXT. This technology is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other websites that promote Co-Branded Pages.&nbsp;

Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.&nbsp;


How do We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information&nbsp;
We may review all demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the site and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis. One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to magTXT users, so that we may target specific advertisements at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous, subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.&nbsp;


Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information&nbsp;
If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.&nbsp;


For any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, the practices of the site, or your dealings with the site, you can contact us at magTXT@gmail.com.

Reputed to be a miraculous fruit able to give a variety of use for the human’s benefits, the need to study it steadily rises.&nbsp;
Generally known as the Souroup, this fruit is called in the Philippines as the Guyabano. It is a fruit of the Annona muricata which belongs to the family of Custard apple trees. It also belongs to the same breed of the cherimoya and the pawpaw. As far as history is concerned it was brought to the Philippines at an early date by way of trade (the Galleons) from Mexico. What is unique about it is that among the other fruits of its genus, it is the only member suitable for preservation.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The guyabano has a lightweight but fragrant wood. It grows sweet scented white flowers which intensifies especially in the morning. It is usually 8-13 inches long and weighs 2.5 kilos. The guybano is dark green but when it is ripe the color turns yellow and its body becomes softer. It has black brown inedible seed. Aside from that, its inside is mostly made up of pulp and fiber. As for its taste the Guyabano is a mixture of various fruits; a combination of strawberry and pineapple with a hint of coconut. The taste buds would also detect markings of sour citrus within the pulp.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Soursoup is only produced in countries where the weather is tropical. And since the Philippines is a tropical country, the tree could be basically grown everywhere in the archipelago. It can grow in all kinds of soil and lives on high levels of humidity and temperatures above 37 degrees which is the secret to its survival. Any point below 5-3degrees could destroy the fruit.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In contrast to it being unpopular in the past, the guyabano is now starting to catch the eyes of many researchers. With the now innumerable studies on this fruit, there is a common factor which is noticeable among these researches. Most of these investigations are found to agree with one another in claiming the soursoup to have an effect which is 9,000 times stronger than that of the Adriamycin and that it could be employed for various types of cancers’ chemotherapy. What makes it amazing is that unlike chemotherapy the compounds of the guyabano only hunts down and kills cells that are cancerous and avoids the healthy ones. So that in contrast to chemotherapy, there is less, if none, harmful side effects resulting from its use such as hair loss, immune depression or extreme nausea. The most proven and known benefits of the Soursoup are as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One can make sweet varieties out of its pulp such as ice cream, juice and candies
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One can get rid of intestinal worms by chewing its leaves
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Applying its leaves on wounds helps in faster healing
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fevers are neutralized by brewing its roots or when its leaves are mixed with bathing water
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Its young leaves can be massaged to the skin for diseases such as rheumatism, eczema and pimples. It also prevents or reduces skin scars from wounds
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In some countries, its leaves are said to draw in a good sleep when arranged inside pillows
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mixing its seeds with water and soap and spraying it on plants keeps away pests that are harmful
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Head lice are destroyed by the oil extracts taken from its seeds
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aside from the lists given, research has also found out that the consumption of 225g of the guyabano’s pulp helps prevent disorders such as UTI, Constipation, Leg cramps, Water retention, Migraines, Anemia and pregnancy complications. However, there still are a number of doctors who deny the benefits of this fruit. But even so, this fruit has achieved the title of being a miraculous fruit.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.&nbsp;

SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.&nbsp;

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/39/la-solidaridad" hreflang="en">The La Solidaridad</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Having only six years of life span, the organization of La Solidaridad has accomplished lots because of the contributions of its prominent members. These people with their trivial pen names are namely Dr. Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce and Jose Maria Panganiban. The Pen names they used were Laong Laan (after a railway station) by Rizal, Plaridel by del Pilar, Taga-llog by Luna, Tikbalang by Mariano Ponce and Jomapa by Panganiban.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the members had one thing in common and that is that they were all liberals who were exiled in the year 1872. The La Solidaridad were also composed of students who attended universities in Europe. Their aim was to increase the awareness of the Spanish on the necessities of its colony in the Philippines. They also aimed to propagate smoother relationships between the Philippines and the Spanish if not closer. The La Solidaridad is a Spanish word which meant in English as the Solidarity. It was created on the 13th of December 1888 in Spain.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The organization was led by Galicano Apacible who was Jose Rizal’s cousin. La Solidaridad once issued a paper which had the same name. It was published on the 15th of February in 1889 at Barcelona, Spain. Graciano Lopez Jaena was the first editor of that paper and was later replaced by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The paper of La Solidaridad focused on nationalistic topics such as the political, cultural, social and economic conditions of a country specifically the Philippines and Spain. It contains articles and essays written by each prominent writer. Aside from that the paper also published articles concerning news and current events which are local and also foreign. They also included speeches coming from prominent leaders of Spain and which talked about the condition of the Philippines.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aside from the first five mentioned, the other known members of La Solidaridad were Robert Lacamra, Jumar lim, Jose Alejandrino, Eduardo de Lete, Isabelo delos Reyes, Antonio Maria Regidor and Pedro Paterno. They also consisted of members which were foreign. The international members are the Austrian ethnologist Professor Blumentritt and Spanish Historian Dr. Miguel Sagrario.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The history of La Solidaridad take its roots back from the initial goals and aspirations of the Propaganda Movement. The Propaganda Movement in the past were looking for ways and venues to express their desires of the Philippines and Spain attaining a successful assimilation. They all then agreed that by creating the La Solidaridad they would be more effective in their mission and so it was established. The organization published their issues every after a week. It started its first publish in February 15, 1889. The La Solidaridad stood as one of the systems that helped the movement propagate for six years.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Comite de Propaganda was the core provider and funder of the La Solidaridad. The editorship position was first offered to Jose Rizal which he declined. His reason was that it was due to his being so busy in the annotation of Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by Antonio de Morga on London. From 1889 up to 1895 the La Solidaridad kept publishing. But after six years they ran out of funds to support their activities and on November 15, 1895, it officially ceased its publication with a farewell note from Marcelo del Pilar.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

NOKIA 6 is Here!</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember the good all days when Nokia 3315 dominated the cellular brands available in the market? It has been the most popular and famous brand for cellular devices. Before mobile devices came in, it was first cellular devices and during that time Nokia has been occupying a great spot as the people’s number one choice.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However despite the popularity and the trusted reputation, Nokia faced a catastrophic event. During the release of mobile devices powered by android and ios, nokia wasn’t able to come up right away with their own version of android phone. Instead of getting along with the trend Nokia took the risk of partnering with Windows. The partnership gave birth to Nokia Lumia, also known as the Window’s Phone. Despite the name and the fresh approach, the new windows phone did not manage to attract more customers since it was launched. It was close to being failure since almost all users prefer using android devices rather than have it on windows.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For quite some time, Nokia remained silent about its attempt to match the release of android phones. Some people are even thinking what happened to this company. Nokia has indeed made a legacy. Now that the contract of the partnership between Nokia and Microsoft is finally over, Nokia is now launching its comeback with Nokia 6.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Last January 19, 2017 the company finally launched their mobile android device, the Nokia 6. Although this device will be launched exclusively in China as of the moment, people all over the world are very much excited for the comeback. But how excited should the people be with the specs of this new device?

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody should be excited because Nokia 6 has amazing specs that can be compared with Samsung and Apple’s most popular devices. Aside from the monster specs, people are very surprised to have it in a very affordable price. It is 70% cheaper compared to Apple’s Iphone 7 and Samsung’s S8. Just imagine having this kind of specs in a market price.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no wonder why it was sold out just a minute after its first launching in China. Although there are no reviews yet about this device people are positively anticipating that this is the thing that they have been waiting for. Everyone is wishing for this device to be available in their country or if not, Nokia will create a device that will be available all over the world.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are also rumors that Nokia, in partnership with HMD Global will release two android mobile devices this year. And Nokia 6 is just the start of their comeback. The public are now waiting if Nokia will try to match the release date of Apple’s Iphone and Samsung’s S series. This will be an exciting year indeed. If you have plans of getting a new mobile device this year, you should watch out because a new competitive brand is going to make rounds for sure.&nbsp;

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/124/dirty-towels-why-theyre-worst-thing-have-home-and-how-often-you-should-change-them" hreflang="en">Dirty Towels: Why They’re The Worst Thing To Have At Home And How Often You Should Change Them</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As simple and as straight forward as its use is, towels are a basic necessity for everyday life. But as important as they are, not a lot of people think to change them often. But because of the fact that we usually use these on a daily basis gives us all the more reason to swap them as soon as possible. The question is: how often is it safe enough to change towels? Here are a few factors:
 
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Number of Uses
Think of washing your towel not in the number of days you’ve used it but in the number of times. The reason for this is because we differ in how many times a day or week we use it. Some of us like to do so daily; others every other day. Others still like to use their towels more than once, especially on a hot summer day.
Recommended: Generally speaking, after 3-4 times, best if you throw in the towel, buddy.
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Environment of Your Home
Moisture – one of the essential components necessary for life. Good news for us who want to keep well-moisturized skin, but bad news for your towel. Moisture equals turning your beloved towel into an evil breeding ground for bacteria and all sorts of yuck. So if you live in a place that’s on the damp side, this means your towel will be facing the dryer more often than it likes.
 

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where You Dry Off Your Towels
Towels, though basically designed for heavy use, may start getting smelly if you don’t dry them off completely. It’s best to dry them outside and ideally, under direct sunlight to kill off those icky germs and deodorize the smell. But if you don’t want to go through the hassle and keep them inside, or you live in a place where you’re unable to put them outside, you may have to replace your towels more frequently.


4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Health and Lifestyle

For people who have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts, a filthy bathroom towel could be your worst nightmare. When you rub this on your skin, the excess dirt and grime can clog your pores and result to a breakout of unsightly blemishes. Not only that, friction from rubbing can cause acne. The recommended way to use your towel is to pat your skin dry, don’t rub!
For people who have an active lifestyle, whether you’re a gym buff or have a physically demanding job, sweat would most likely make your towel smell. The moment your nasal faculties alert you of even the slightest hint of a stench, replace that thing ASAP.

There are still things that are seemingly odd in nature and there are also some that are quite deceiving. Take for example this Emerald Green Cat that was discovered in a small town in Bulgaria.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The town people and even people from far cities are quite familiar with this seemingly odd creature because of its color. The cat has been spotted walking around the city, it gives the town people the impression that it is a stray and it only gets its food by roaming around the place.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to its distinct color and possible breakthrough in the feline world, people from far countries travelled to Bulgaria just to take a closer peek and even take some pictures of it. However, this cat’s stardom started to fade when rainstorms came. Its bright emerald green color slowly faded away when rain started to fall.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been found out that the cat got its color from a barrel of paint where it sleeps. Although paints contain toxins that are eventually not good for the health, the cat was actually in good shape all throughout its stardom. With its color fading away, its popularity indeed started to slow down, however its quite noticeable she enjoyed her moment and made the most of it by gaining extra pounds.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.&nbsp;

SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.&nbsp;

The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure. The suspect was not a licensed medical professional but because of cheaper rates he managed to convince these ladies to try it all for the aim of becoming beautiful.&nbsp;

Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.&nbsp;

Reputed to be a miraculous fruit able to give a variety of use for the human’s benefits, the need to study it steadily rises.&nbsp;
Generally known as the Souroup, this fruit is called in the Philippines as the Guyabano. It is a fruit of the Annona muricata which belongs to the family of Custard apple trees. It also belongs to the same breed of the cherimoya and the pawpaw. As far as history is concerned it was brought to the Philippines at an early date by way of trade (the Galleons) from Mexico. What is unique about it is that among the other fruits of its genus, it is the only member suitable for preservation.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The guyabano has a lightweight but fragrant wood. It grows sweet scented white flowers which intensifies especially in the morning. It is usually 8-13 inches long and weighs 2.5 kilos. The guybano is dark green but when it is ripe the color turns yellow and its body becomes softer. It has black brown inedible seed. Aside from that, its inside is mostly made up of pulp and fiber. As for its taste the Guyabano is a mixture of various fruits; a combination of strawberry and pineapple with a hint of coconut. The taste buds would also detect markings of sour citrus within the pulp.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Soursoup is only produced in countries where the weather is tropical. And since the Philippines is a tropical country, the tree could be basically grown everywhere in the archipelago. It can grow in all kinds of soil and lives on high levels of humidity and temperatures above 37 degrees which is the secret to its survival. Any point below 5-3degrees could destroy the fruit.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In contrast to it being unpopular in the past, the guyabano is now starting to catch the eyes of many researchers. With the now innumerable studies on this fruit, there is a common factor which is noticeable among these researches. Most of these investigations are found to agree with one another in claiming the soursoup to have an effect which is 9,000 times stronger than that of the Adriamycin and that it could be employed for various types of cancers’ chemotherapy. What makes it amazing is that unlike chemotherapy the compounds of the guyabano only hunts down and kills cells that are cancerous and avoids the healthy ones. So that in contrast to chemotherapy, there is less, if none, harmful side effects resulting from its use such as hair loss, immune depression or extreme nausea. The most proven and known benefits of the Soursoup are as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One can make sweet varieties out of its pulp such as ice cream, juice and candies
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One can get rid of intestinal worms by chewing its leaves
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Applying its leaves on wounds helps in faster healing
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fevers are neutralized by brewing its roots or when its leaves are mixed with bathing water
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Its young leaves can be massaged to the skin for diseases such as rheumatism, eczema and pimples. It also prevents or reduces skin scars from wounds
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In some countries, its leaves are said to draw in a good sleep when arranged inside pillows
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mixing its seeds with water and soap and spraying it on plants keeps away pests that are harmful
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Head lice are destroyed by the oil extracts taken from its seeds
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aside from the lists given, research has also found out that the consumption of 225g of the guyabano’s pulp helps prevent disorders such as UTI, Constipation, Leg cramps, Water retention, Migraines, Anemia and pregnancy complications. However, there still are a number of doctors who deny the benefits of this fruit. But even so, this fruit has achieved the title of being a miraculous fruit.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.&nbsp;

SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.&nbsp;

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/39/la-solidaridad" hreflang="en">The La Solidaridad</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Having only six years of life span, the organization of La Solidaridad has accomplished lots because of the contributions of its prominent members. These people with their trivial pen names are namely Dr. Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce and Jose Maria Panganiban. The Pen names they used were Laong Laan (after a railway station) by Rizal, Plaridel by del Pilar, Taga-llog by Luna, Tikbalang by Mariano Ponce and Jomapa by Panganiban.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the members had one thing in common and that is that they were all liberals who were exiled in the year 1872. The La Solidaridad were also composed of students who attended universities in Europe. Their aim was to increase the awareness of the Spanish on the necessities of its colony in the Philippines. They also aimed to propagate smoother relationships between the Philippines and the Spanish if not closer. The La Solidaridad is a Spanish word which meant in English as the Solidarity. It was created on the 13th of December 1888 in Spain.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The organization was led by Galicano Apacible who was Jose Rizal’s cousin. La Solidaridad once issued a paper which had the same name. It was published on the 15th of February in 1889 at Barcelona, Spain. Graciano Lopez Jaena was the first editor of that paper and was later replaced by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The paper of La Solidaridad focused on nationalistic topics such as the political, cultural, social and economic conditions of a country specifically the Philippines and Spain. It contains articles and essays written by each prominent writer. Aside from that the paper also published articles concerning news and current events which are local and also foreign. They also included speeches coming from prominent leaders of Spain and which talked about the condition of the Philippines.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aside from the first five mentioned, the other known members of La Solidaridad were Robert Lacamra, Jumar lim, Jose Alejandrino, Eduardo de Lete, Isabelo delos Reyes, Antonio Maria Regidor and Pedro Paterno. They also consisted of members which were foreign. The international members are the Austrian ethnologist Professor Blumentritt and Spanish Historian Dr. Miguel Sagrario.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The history of La Solidaridad take its roots back from the initial goals and aspirations of the Propaganda Movement. The Propaganda Movement in the past were looking for ways and venues to express their desires of the Philippines and Spain attaining a successful assimilation. They all then agreed that by creating the La Solidaridad they would be more effective in their mission and so it was established. The organization published their issues every after a week. It started its first publish in February 15, 1889. The La Solidaridad stood as one of the systems that helped the movement propagate for six years.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Comite de Propaganda was the core provider and funder of the La Solidaridad. The editorship position was first offered to Jose Rizal which he declined. His reason was that it was due to his being so busy in the annotation of Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by Antonio de Morga on London. From 1889 up to 1895 the La Solidaridad kept publishing. But after six years they ran out of funds to support their activities and on November 15, 1895, it officially ceased its publication with a farewell note from Marcelo del Pilar.</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><div class="custom-class-clear-float-both"></div></span></div>

NOKIA 6 is Here!</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember the good all days when Nokia 3315 dominated the cellular brands available in the market? It has been the most popular and famous brand for cellular devices. Before mobile devices came in, it was first cellular devices and during that time Nokia has been occupying a great spot as the people’s number one choice.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However despite the popularity and the trusted reputation, Nokia faced a catastrophic event. During the release of mobile devices powered by android and ios, nokia wasn’t able to come up right away with their own version of android phone. Instead of getting along with the trend Nokia took the risk of partnering with Windows. The partnership gave birth to Nokia Lumia, also known as the Window’s Phone. Despite the name and the fresh approach, the new windows phone did not manage to attract more customers since it was launched. It was close to being failure since almost all users prefer using android devices rather than have it on windows.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For quite some time, Nokia remained silent about its attempt to match the release of android phones. Some people are even thinking what happened to this company. Nokia has indeed made a legacy. Now that the contract of the partnership between Nokia and Microsoft is finally over, Nokia is now launching its comeback with Nokia 6.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Last January 19, 2017 the company finally launched their mobile android device, the Nokia 6. Although this device will be launched exclusively in China as of the moment, people all over the world are very much excited for the comeback. But how excited should the people be with the specs of this new device?

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody should be excited because Nokia 6 has amazing specs that can be compared with Samsung and Apple’s most popular devices. Aside from the monster specs, people are very surprised to have it in a very affordable price. It is 70% cheaper compared to Apple’s Iphone 7 and Samsung’s S8. Just imagine having this kind of specs in a market price.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no wonder why it was sold out just a minute after its first launching in China. Although there are no reviews yet about this device people are positively anticipating that this is the thing that they have been waiting for. Everyone is wishing for this device to be available in their country or if not, Nokia will create a device that will be available all over the world.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are also rumors that Nokia, in partnership with HMD Global will release two android mobile devices this year. And Nokia 6 is just the start of their comeback. The public are now waiting if Nokia will try to match the release date of Apple’s Iphone and Samsung’s S series. This will be an exciting year indeed. If you have plans of getting a new mobile device this year, you should watch out because a new competitive brand is going to make rounds for sure.&nbsp;

</div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/article/124/dirty-towels-why-theyre-worst-thing-have-home-and-how-often-you-should-change-them" hreflang="en">Dirty Towels: Why They’re The Worst Thing To Have At Home And How Often You Should Change Them</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As simple and as straight forward as its use is, towels are a basic necessity for everyday life. But as important as they are, not a lot of people think to change them often. But because of the fact that we usually use these on a daily basis gives us all the more reason to swap them as soon as possible. The question is: how often is it safe enough to change towels? Here are a few factors:
 
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Number of Uses
Think of washing your towel not in the number of days you’ve used it but in the number of times. The reason for this is because we differ in how many times a day or week we use it. Some of us like to do so daily; others every other day. Others still like to use their towels more than once, especially on a hot summer day.
Recommended: Generally speaking, after 3-4 times, best if you throw in the towel, buddy.
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Environment of Your Home
Moisture – one of the essential components necessary for life. Good news for us who want to keep well-moisturized skin, but bad news for your towel. Moisture equals turning your beloved towel into an evil breeding ground for bacteria and all sorts of yuck. So if you live in a place that’s on the damp side, this means your towel will be facing the dryer more often than it likes.
 

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where You Dry Off Your Towels
Towels, though basically designed for heavy use, may start getting smelly if you don’t dry them off completely. It’s best to dry them outside and ideally, under direct sunlight to kill off those icky germs and deodorize the smell. But if you don’t want to go through the hassle and keep them inside, or you live in a place where you’re unable to put them outside, you may have to replace your towels more frequently.


4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Health and Lifestyle

For people who have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts, a filthy bathroom towel could be your worst nightmare. When you rub this on your skin, the excess dirt and grime can clog your pores and result to a breakout of unsightly blemishes. Not only that, friction from rubbing can cause acne. The recommended way to use your towel is to pat your skin dry, don’t rub!
For people who have an active lifestyle, whether you’re a gym buff or have a physically demanding job, sweat would most likely make your towel smell. The moment your nasal faculties alert you of even the slightest hint of a stench, replace that thing ASAP.

There are still things that are seemingly odd in nature and there are also some that are quite deceiving. Take for example this Emerald Green Cat that was discovered in a small town in Bulgaria.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The town people and even people from far cities are quite familiar with this seemingly odd creature because of its color. The cat has been spotted walking around the city, it gives the town people the impression that it is a stray and it only gets its food by roaming around the place.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to its distinct color and possible breakthrough in the feline world, people from far countries travelled to Bulgaria just to take a closer peek and even take some pictures of it. However, this cat’s stardom started to fade when rainstorms came. Its bright emerald green color slowly faded away when rain started to fall.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been found out that the cat got its color from a barrel of paint where it sleeps. Although paints contain toxins that are eventually not good for the health, the cat was actually in good shape all throughout its stardom. With its color fading away, its popularity indeed started to slow down, however its quite noticeable she enjoyed her moment and made the most of it by gaining extra pounds.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, mobile apps are being installed because of its popularity. When a wide audience seemed to use it even for just a short time, you should expect for others to try it too without really verifying its security measures.&nbsp;

SARAHAH Honesty App is supposedly an app that can be used in giving feedbacks anonymously. Seems like people nowadays are drawn into intriguing stuff more than ever. However accordingly the app works in such a way that the person who has been rated or given feedback has no way of tracing or replying to it. The creator of the app tend to give its users the chance to leave positive comments or feedbacks as an act of kindness while keeping their identity unknown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However the entire community has been totally shocked (shookt) when it has been revealed that this app is actually unknowingly stealing your personal details such as your contact list. Aside from stealing, they make use of it by uploading it to their data base and who knows what they could do about it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you installed this app, it will only take them a while to steal your info. Logging out from the app can't make any difference at all. The best thing to do is to never ever install it and be more cautious in choosing an app.&nbsp;

The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure. The suspect was not a licensed medical professional but because of cheaper rates he managed to convince these ladies to try it all for the aim of becoming beautiful.&nbsp;

Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.&nbsp;
