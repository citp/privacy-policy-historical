# Notice of Privacy Practices

Notice of Privacy Practices
Mayo Clinic has always been a leader in protecting patients’ medical information.
Maintaining patient privacy is part of our mission to serve the needs of the patient
first. Controlled use of medical information by staff at Mayo Clinic is essential to
providing optimum patient care.
The United States government created rules for the use and protection of medical
and health information by hospitals, clinics and other medical practices. The
rules are a result of the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA). They are meant to provide all patients in the United States with
standard privacy protections. One rule requires hospitals and clinics to provide
all patients with a Notice of Privacy Practices to explain how patient medical
information is used. The same rule requires hospitals and clinics to keep records
showing that patients have received the notice.
We are happy to provide you with this copy of Mayo Clinic’s Notice of Privacy
Practices. We hope it will answer any questions you may have about how patient
medical information is used here. In accordance with the federal government
HIPAA rules, please sign the form that came with this notice and bring it with
you to your appointment. Signing the form will show that you have received the
notice; it will in no way affect the care you receive at Mayo Clinic.
If you have questions about anything contained in this notice, please feel free
to contact the site privacy officer for the applicable Mayo Clinic entity. Contact
information for these individuals is provided in the final section of this notice.
Thank you for placing your care, and your trust, in Mayo Clinic.
Sincerely,
John H. Noseworthy, M.D.
President and CEO, Mayo Clinic
