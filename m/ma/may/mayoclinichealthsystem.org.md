A Word about Federal and State Law
Federal and state laws require Mayo Clinic to protect your medical information and federal law requires us to
describe to you how we handle that information. When federal and state privacy laws are different and conflict,
and the state law is more protective of your information or provides you with greater access to your information,
then we will follow state law. For example, where we have identified specific state law requirements in this notice,
the referenced Mayo Clinic location will follow the more protective state law requirements.
Your Rights
When it comes to your health information, you have certain rights. This section explains your rights and some of
Mayo Clinic’s responsibilities to help you.
Get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record
   • You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information
       we have about you. If you would like, we also can send this information in either paper or electronic form to
       another person you identify in your request. For more information about requesting your medical records, ask
       us or go online to the Patient and Visitor Guide for the location where you receive your care, then explore the
       release of information options: http://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide
   • We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request. We
       may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee.
Ask Mayo Clinic to correct your medical record
   • You can ask us to correct health information about you that you think is incorrect or incomplete.
   • We may say “no” to your request, but we’ll tell you why in writing within 60 days.
Request confidential communications
   • You can ask us to contact you in a specific way (for example, home or office phone) or to send mail to a
       different address.
   • We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests.
                                                             1                                           MC5256-01rev0318


Ask Mayo Clinic to limit what we use or share
    • You can ask us not to use or share certain health information for treatment, payment, or Mayo Clinic’s
       operations. We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if it would be harmful or
       compromise your care.
    • If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information
       for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will say “yes” unless a law
       requires us to share that information.
Get a list of those with whom we’ve shared information
    • You can ask for a list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for six years prior to the
       date you ask, who we shared it with, and why.
    • We will include all the disclosures except for those about treatment, payment, and health care operations, and
       certain other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make). We’ll provide one accounting a year for free but
       will charge a reasonable, cost-based fee if you ask for another one within 12 months.
Get a copy of this privacy notice
    • You can ask for a paper copy of this notice at any time, even if you have agreed to receive the notice
       electronically. Mayo Clinic will provide you with a paper copy promptly.
Choose someone to act for you
    • If you have given someone medical power of attorney or if someone is your legal guardian, that person can
       exercise your rights and make choices about your health information.
    • We will make sure the person has this authority and can act for you before we take any action.
File a complaint if you feel your rights are violated
    • You can complain if you feel we have violated your rights by contacting us.
    • You can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights by
       sending a letter to 200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201, calling 1-877-696-6775, or visiting
       www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/complaints/
    We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint.
Your Choices
For certain health information, you can tell us your choices about what we share.
If you have a clear preference for how we share your information in the situations described below, talk to us. Tell us
what you want us to do, and we will follow your instructions.
In these cases, you have both the right and choice to tell us to:
    • Share information with your family, close friends, or others involved in your care
    • Share information in a disaster relief situation
    • Include your information in a hospital directory
    If you are not able to tell us your preference, for example if you are unconscious, we may go ahead and share
    your information if we believe it is in your best interest. We may also share your information when needed to
    lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety.
    Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
    Wisconsin law generally requires patient consent to share health information with family members or friends,
    except as required or authorized by law.
In these cases we never share your information unless you give us written permission:
    • Marketing purposes
    • Most sharing of psychotherapy notes
Mayo Clinic does not sell or rent our patients’ names or addresses to any organization outside of Mayo Clinic.
In the case of fundraising, Mayo Clinic may contact you for fundraising efforts, but you can tell us not to contact
you again.
    Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
    Florida law generally requires patient consent to contact patients for purposes of providing information
    regarding treatment alternatives, services, or goods.
Our Uses and Disclosures
How does Mayo Clinic typically use or share your health information?

                                                              2                                            MC5256-01rev0318


    Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
    Minnesota law generally requires patient consent for disclosures of health information for treatment purposes,
    unless the disclosure is to a Mayo-related entity or consent is not possible due to a medical emergency.
To run our organization
    We can use and share your health information to run our practice, improve your care, and contact you when
    necessary. All of our locations work closely together to improve health care operations across the Mayo Clinic
    health system, and we may use health information for those activities. We may also share health information
    with another health care provider who has treated you, or to your insurance company. This may be done when
    the information is needed for health care operations of the health care provider or the insurance company, such
    as quality improvement activities, evaluations of health care professionals, and state and federal regulatory
    reviews.
    Example: We use health information about you to manage your treatment and services.
    Additional Applicable State Law Requirements
    Minnesota law generally requires patient consent for disclosures of health information to other providers for
    health care operations purposes, unless the disclosure is to a Mayo- related entity.

    care operations purposes.
    Wisconsin law generally requires patient consent to disclose HIV test results for certain health care operations.
To bill for your services

    purposes, unless the disclosure is to a Mayo-related entity.

How else can Mayo Clinic use or share your health information?

good, such as public health and research. We have to meet many conditions in the law before we can share your
information for these purposes. For more information, you can go to this online link: www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/

    for medical research purposes. We will obtain such consent from you or note your refusal to participate in
    any research study, or we will make a good faith effort to obtain such consent or refusal, before releasing any
    identifiable information to an outside researcher for research purposes.
    Wisconsin law generally requires patient consent before we may disclose health information for research
    purposes to a researcher who is not affiliated with Mayo Clinic. In some situations, we may disclose health
    information for research purposes to a researcher who agrees to protect the privacy of your information.
    Private-pay patients may be able to opt out of the use or disclosure of your information for research purposes.
    Florida law generally requires patient consent for disclosures of identifiable health information to outside
    researchers for medical research purposes.
Comply with the law

    and Human Services if it requests to see that we’re complying with federal privacy law.

Organized Health Care Arrangement (OHCA) at Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic participates in an Organized Health Care Arrangement (OHCA) under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA). An OHCA is an arrangement that allows Mayo Clinic entities to share health
information about our patients and/or plan members to promote the joint operations of the participating entities.
The entities covered by this notice, which are listed above, have formed an OHCA and share health information
with each other for the treatment, payment, and health care operations of the OHCA.
These entities also have a separate OHCA and share health information with the Mayo Medical Plan, a HIPAA
Covered Entity that provides medical benefits to Mayo Clinic employees, retirees and their families.
Bloomer Lakeview, Inc., Mayo Clinic Health System — Franciscan Healthcare, Inc., Mayo Clinic Health System
— Franciscan Medical Center, Inc., Mayo Clinic Health System — Northwest Wisconsin Region, Inc., also have
a separate OHCA and share health information with Health Tradition Health Plan, a HIPAA Covered Entity and
Mayo Clinic owned Wisconsin insurance company that offers insured medical plans to employers and individuals

The Health Tradition Health Plan and Mayo Medical Plan do not share health information with each other and are
covered by their own separate Notice of Privacy Practices, which can be found here:
    • Health Tradition Health Plan: https://www.healthtradition.com/home/policies/privacy-notice/
    • Mayo Medical Plan: http://www.mayo.edu/pmts/mc0900-mc0999/mc0937-59.pdf
Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records
Certain Mayo Clinic facilities, units, and staff specialize in providing substance use disorder treatment (Programs).
The confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records maintained by these Programs is protected by special
federal law and regulations, in addition to HIPAA. Generally, such a Program may not say to a person outside the
Program that a patient attends the Program, or disclose any information identifying a patient as having or having
had a substance use disorder unless:
    (1) The patient consents in writing;
    (2) The disclosure is allowed by a court order; or
    (3) The disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical emergency or to qualified personnel for
        research,audit, or program evaluation.
Violation of the federal law and regulations governing substance use disorder patient records by a Program is a
crime. Suspected violations may be reported to appropriate authorities in accordance with federal regulations:
    The U.S. Attorney where the Program is located:
		Arizona: District of Arizona, Two Renaissance Square, 40 N. Central Avenue, Suite 1200,
		 Phoenix, AZ 85004-4408 Phone 602-514-7500
		Florida: Middle District of Florida, 300 N. Hogan Street, Suite 700, Jacksonville, FL 32202
		Phone 904-301-6300
		Iowa: Northern District of Iowa, 111 7th Avenue S.E., Box #1, Cedar Rapids, IA 52401 Phone 319-363-6333
		Minnesota: District of Minnesota, 316 N. Robert Street, Suite 404, St. Paul, MN 55101 Phone 651-848-1950
		Wisconsin: Western District of Wisconsin, 222 West Washington Avenue, Suite 700, Madison, WI 53703

        SAMHSA Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857
        Phone 240-276-1660
Federal law and regulations do not protect any information about a crime committed by a patient either at the
Program or against any person who works for the Program or about any threat to commit such a crime.
Federal laws and regulations do not protect any information about suspected child abuse or neglect from being
reported under state law to appropriate state or local authorities.
(See 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 42 U.S.C. 290ee-3 for Federal laws and 42 CFR Part 2 for Federal regulations.)
Other Particularly Sensitive Conditions
Certain other types of health information may have additional protection under state law. For example, health
information about mental health, HIV/AIDS and genetic testing results is treated differently than other types of
health information under certain state laws. To the extent applicable, Mayo Clinic would need to get your written
permission before disclosing these categories of information to others in many circumstances.
Contact Information
If you want to file a complaint, express concerns, or further inquire about Mayo Clinic’s use or disclosure of
health information, please contact the Mayo Clinic Privacy Officer by calling 507-266-6286 or send an email to
