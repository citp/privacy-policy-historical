Privacy Policy

This portion of the Agreement describes how we collect information from you or about you, why we collect this information, how we will use or disclose this information and how you can update or delete personably identifiable information collected about you from our records. In addition, this portion of the Agreement sets forth our general policies on security.

IP Addresses

There are several types of information we collect. For all visitors to the Service, we collect and log your IP address. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the internet. IP addresses allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with one another. We collect IP address information to properly administer our system and to gather aggregate information on visitors to our site and how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing. This aggregate information may be shared with advertisers, sponsors and others businesses. To maintain your anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We will use IP address information, however, to personally identify you in order to enforce our legal rights or when required to do so by law enforcement authorities.

Cookies

We also place small data files, called "cookies," in the browser file of your computer's hard drive. These cookies automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with the Service. Most browsers automatically accept these cookies, but you usually can change your browser setting to prevent the acceptance of cookies. In addition, we usually collect the domain name of the server from which you are visiting. This can provide us with information relating to the sources of our traffic. Collecting this information does not allow us to personally identify you.

Registration, Health Risk Assessment and Disease Management Information

We also collect personal information that you choose to share with us in the registration, risk-assessment and disease management portions of the Service. This information may include e-mail addresses and your answers to questions. Again, this information is only collected with your permission and, as explained below, may be updated or deleted by you at any time. We collect this information, should you decide to provide it to us, to tailor the Service to your personal health interests and needs. For example, the registration process allows you to highlight the health topics of interest to you, so that we can notify you when a new article or other information becomes available on these topics on the Service. It also allows us to create personal disease and wellness management programs for you to use on a recurring basis. 

Surveys

At times, you may be asked to complete survey questions that appear on the Service. If you agree to participate in the survey, you will be asked to review and accept certain additional terms and conditions relating to use of the information you furnish, which may include personally identifiable information. These terms and conditions are in addition to the Privacy Policies set forth in this Agreement, including sharing such personally identifiable information with market research firms with which we have a business relationship. 

E-Mail Communications, Newsletters and Related Services

We may, from time to time, send you informational e-mails or surveys. In addition, the Service provides you with the opportunity to receive certain other communications from us or third parties. To stop receiving communications, you may send an e-mail message to comments@mayoclinic.com, visit the following URL [http://www.mayoclinic.com/home?id=12.1](https://web.archive.org/invoke.cfm?id=12.1) or send mail to the following postal address: Security and Privacy Officer, MayoClinic.com, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905.

Information for E-Commerce Transactions

Some areas of the Service may allow you to conduct e-commerce transactions. In connection with these transactions, we collect data necessary to complete the transaction and that is furnished by you. This information may be furnished to a third party in order to facilitate the transaction. 

Aggregate Information

We use general traffic, site usage, and length of stay information in reports to advertisers and firms with which we have a business relationship. This sort of information is shared only on an aggregated basis and does not personally identify you.

Children's Privacy

The Service is intended for adults age 18 and over. It is not intended for or designed to attract persons under the age of 18. We do not permit registration by, nor do we collect personally identifiable information from, any person we actually know to be under the age of 18.

Changing or Deleting Information

The Service gives you the opportunity to change or delete information that has previously been furnished by you to us. To change such information, you can send an e-mail to us at comments@mayoclinic.com.

Other Sites

Our privacy policies apply only to your use of the Service. The Service contains links to other sites, including sites that may indicate a special relationship with us. While we do not disclose personably identifiable information to those operating these linked sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you.

Changes to Our Privacy and Security Policies

Just as with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, we may change the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policies at any time by posting revisions on the Service. You agree to review the Privacy Policies portions of this Agreement each time you use the Service so that you are aware of any modifications made to these policies. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as posted on the Service at the time of your access or use, including the Privacy Policies then in effect.
