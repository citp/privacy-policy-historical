# - MayoClinic.com

**Updated June 20, 2008.**

MayoClinic.com is committed to protecting your online privacy. We feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via the Internet. You can visit www.MayoClinic.com without revealing any personal information. However, you are required to provide an e-mail address to subscribe to a newsletter. 

## How we and our affiliates collect and use personal information

MayoClinic.com may contain links to Web sites operated by third parties. MayoClinic.com has no control over the privacy policies and practices of such third party sites, and if you have any concerns, you are urged to review the terms of those sites for more information about the policies applicable to those sites. 

## IP addresses

We collect and log the IP address of all visitors to MayoClinic.com. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. IP addresses allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with one another. We collect IP address information so that we can properly administer our system and gather aggregate information about how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing. This aggregate information may be shared with advertisers, sponsors and other businesses. To maintain your anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We will use IP address information, however, to personally identify you in order to enforce our legal rights or when required to do so by law enforcement authorities. 

## How we use cookies

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, MayoClinic.com uses cookies to provide us with information relating to the sources of our site traffic. Collecting this information, however, does not allow us to personally identify you. 

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so that you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Our site requires that both cookies and JavaScript be enabled. If you reject cookies from our site, some parts of the site may not work properly for you. 

## Surveys

You may be asked to complete surveys when you visit MayoClinic.com. We use information from surveys to better understand the needs of our users and to gather information about health care trends and issues. We may share information from surveys with third parties who perform data management services for our site. Those third parties have agreed to keep all data from surveys confidential. Also, we may share information from surveys in an aggregated, de-identified form with third parties with whom we have a business relationship. 

## How we protect your personal information

All data that you enter on this site are encrypted with secure server software (SSL). The encryption means that your data are protected while they are being transferred over the Internet to our servers. 

Once your data reach our servers, the same state-of-the art security software that guards our company's essential business data protects your data as well. 

In addition to using the most secure technology available, we de-identify all data before they are used in any aggregate reporting that may be done. 

## What we provide to third parties

Except as noted above for surveys, MayoClinic.com does not provide any third party access to your IP address and e-mail address. 

We may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our visitors, traffic patterns and related site information. These data reflect site-usage patterns gathered during visits to our Web site each month, but they do not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member unless that member has given us permission to share that information. 

Our sponsors and advertisers and their Ad Servers may use cookies when you view pages on our site. They use those cookies to collect nonpersonal information as a way of measuring the effectiveness of their advertising. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or how they manage the nonpersonal information they gather through them. However, our sponsors and advertisers have agreed that they will not collect any personally identifiable information from our site visitors while they are on MayoClinic.com. If you click on an advertisement on MayoClinic.com and visit a site maintained by one of our sponsors or advertisers, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you. 

Some Ad Servers allow you to opt out of anonymous data collection through the use of cookies. To do so, you must opt out of such data collection with each individual site. You can opt out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) gateway opt-out site. At that site you can also review the privacy policies of those Ad Servers. 

## Aggregate information

We use general traffic, site usage and length-of-stay information in reports to advertisers and firms with which we have a business relationship. This sort of information is shared only in aggregate and does not personally identify you. 

## Children's privacy

This site is intended for adults age 18 and older. It is not intended for or designed to attract people under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know to be under the age of 18. 

## E-mail communications, newsletter and related services

E-mail communication that you send to us via the e-mail links on our site may be shared with a Customer Service representative, employee, medical expert or agent that is most able to address your inquiry.

The e-mail functionality on our site does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. It's possible that your e-mail communication may be accessed or viewed by another Internet user while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your communication private, do not use our e-mail.
