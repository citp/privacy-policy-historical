# Privacy Policy - Mayo Medical Laboratories

We respect the right to privacy of all visitors to the www.mayomedicallaboratories.com Web site. We do not collect information that would personally identify you unless you choose to provide it. The personal information that you submit is shared only with those people in the Mayo organization who need this information to respond to your question or request. Information submitted through Mayo Medical Laboratories' online forms may be collected to ensure technical functionality. It will also be utilized to address any inappropriate use of our Web site. We do not save personal information to use for other purposes, nor do we provide it to any other organization.

We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide. You should understand, however, that electronic transmissions via the Internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or other valid legal processes, we will not share any personally identifiable information we receive from you with any parties outside of Mayo Clinic.

## Surveys

We occasionally survey visitors to our site. The information from these surveys is used in aggregate form to help us understand the needs of our visitors so that we can improve our site. We generally do not ask for information in surveys that would personally identify you; if we do request contact information for follow-up, you may decline to provide it. If survey respondents provide personal information (such as an e-mail address) in a survey, it is shared only with those people who need to see it to respond to the question or request.

We make every effort to respond in a timely fashion once communications are received. Once we have responded to your communication, it is discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry.

## IP Addresses

The Web server automatically collects the IP (which stands for Internet Protocol) address of the computers that access our site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you access the Internet.

We use this information in aggregate form to understand how our site is being used and how we can better serve visitors.

We collect information about visitors to our site using "cookies." We use **persistent** cookies to recognize a repeat visitor and offer the visitor a set of services or information requested in a previous visit. We use **session** cookies to track a visitor's path through our site during a visit, to help us understand how people use our site.
