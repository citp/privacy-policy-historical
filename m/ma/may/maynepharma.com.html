<h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2></font>
</dt><dt>
<p><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">The information collected may include an individual's:<br>•&nbsp;name <br>•&nbsp;date of birth <br>•&nbsp;occupation&nbsp; <br>•&nbsp;current and previous address (postal and email) <br>•&nbsp;telephone number <br>•&nbsp;financial details <br>•&nbsp;tax file number <br>•&nbsp;health information and&nbsp; <br>•&nbsp;other information that we consider necessary</font></span></span></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<h2>How do we collect personal information?</h2></font>
</dt><dt>
<p><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will, if reasonable and practicable to do so, collect personal information directly from the individual concerned. This may take place when the individual fills out documents such as an application form or an administrative form or when the individual gives us personal information in person, over the telephone or through our websites. </font></span></span></p>
</dt><dt>
<p><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">In certain circumstances, we will collect personal information from third parties. For example, we may need to collect personal information from: <br>•&nbsp;a credit reporting agency <br>•&nbsp;an individual's financial advisers <br>•&nbsp;an individual's representatives (e.g. authorised representatives or legal advisers) <br>•&nbsp;an individual's employer <br>•&nbsp;an individual's health service provider <br>•&nbsp;an individual's treating health professional <br>•&nbsp;publicly available sources of information or any other organisation identified below (see 'Disclosing personal information' below)</font></span></span></p><font face="Arial" size="2">

<h2>Consequences of not providing personal information</h2></font>
</dt><dt>
<p><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">Failing to provide Mayne Pharma with certain personal information means that, potentially, we may not be able to provide the relevant service to the individual concerned.</font></span></span></p>
</dt><dt><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<h2>Disclosing personal information</h2></font></span></span>
</dt><dt>
<p><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">In line with modern business practices and to meet individuals' specific needs, we may disclose personal information to the organisations described below. </font></span></span></p>
</dt><dt>
<p><span class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial" size="2">Where personal information is disclosed, we will seek to ensure that the information is held, used and disclosed consistently with the National Privacy Principles contained in the Act, any relevant Health Privacy Principles under state legislation (e.g. those contained in the Health Records Act 2001 (Vic) or the privacy provisions contained in Part 2 of the Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997 (ACT)) and other applicable privacy laws and codes. </font></span></span></p>
</dt><dt>
