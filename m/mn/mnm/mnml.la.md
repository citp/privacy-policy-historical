We might also collect personal information from you about a third party, for instance if you ask us to ship product to a third party we may ask for the name, e-mail address, address, phone number, etc. of the recipient. That information will only be used for the specific purpose for which the information was provided and mnml will not further contact the third party unless the third party contacts us.

We may use “cookies” to gather information about your visits to our website and to enhance your experience. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive and used by mnml.la to enhance your shopping experience by speeding up the browsing experience and website performance.

We may collect “click stream” data (e.g. server address, domain name, etc.) and demographic or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to better understand our audience. This information may be combined with information you have provided to us thereby enabling us to enhance your experience.

#### LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES

For your convenience and to improve the usage of the website, we insert links to third parties, for which this Privacy Policy does not apply. These links take you outside our services and off the mnml.la website and are beyond our control. This includes links from parties that may use mnml logos as part of a co-branding agreement or sell mnml’s products. The sites you can link to have their own separate Privacy Policy and although we seek to protect the integrity of our site, mnml is not responsible and cannot be held liable for the content and activities of these sites. Your visit/access to these sites therefore is entirely at your own risk. Please note that these other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.

By using our website, you (the visitor) agree to allow third parties to process your IP address, in order to determine your location for the purpose of currency conversion. You also agree to have that currency stored in a session cookie in your browser (a temporary cookie which gets automatically removed when you close your browser). We do this in order for the selected currency to remain selected and consistent when browsing our website so that the prices can convert to your (the visitor) local currency.
