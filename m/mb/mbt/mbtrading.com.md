**PRIVACY POLICY CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION**  
Did you know a federal law exists that regulates the collection, use and safeguarding of your nonpublic personal financial information by: (1) banks; (2) securities, futures and forex industry members; (3) insurance companies; and (4) other financial institutions. "Nonpublic personal financial information" is defined as specific information that is not available to the general public.

Before a company can share your nonpublic personal information that you have entrusted with them, they are required to notify you in advance of the sharing arrangement, and to give you ample time to opt-out.

It is our desire to keep you informed of changes in federal, state or self-regulatory organization rules and regulations that may have an impact on how we conduct our business.

**OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY**  
We understand the importance of maintaining the privacy of your personal and financial information. By entrusting us with your information, we would like to assure you of our commitment to keeping it private. We have taken measurable steps to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your information. 

This notice will help you understand our overall privacy policy and the type of information that we collect, use and protect, which will also be provided to you on an annual basis and within your account opening documents. 

**PRIVATE POLICY SUMMARY**

We have implemented procedures to protect your nonpublic personal and financial information.

(which clears and settles your futures transactions); and credit bureaus (e.g. Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union). "Required by law" examples include court orders and regulatory investigations. 

We do not sell your personal information to third-party marketers or any other entity for any purpose.

Our commitment to privacy protection extends to both current and former customers, except as permitted or required by law.

Further, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state regulations to guard your information.

**NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES**  
We do not share nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties, unless otherwise permitted or required by law, which does not aid in the carrying out of your request or instructions.

**OPT OUT OF DISCLOSURE**  
The law allows you to "opt out" of our sharing nonpublic personal information about you in certain circumstances with affiliated and nonaffiliated companies; that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures. We do not currently share information about you with any affiliate or third party that triggers this opt-out right. Therefore, there is no need for you to opt out. If in the future we desire to disclose your information in a way that is inconsistent with this policy, we will notify you in advance and provide you with the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure.
