PII is any information that can be used to specifically identify you as an individual. For example, you may submit and we may collect your name, email address, address, phone number, or similar information through the Site.

					<h2>How We Collect Your Information</h2>
					<div class="desc full">
						<p><u>Cookies and Beacons</u></p>
						<p>Like all websites, we use cookies and other technologies, including web beacons, so that we can enhance your user experience.

None of the information collected by our cookies or web beacons is PII.</p>
						<p>Cookies are bits of data placed on your hard drive when you visit websites. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account's privacy. We use cookies to maintain your identity between sessions so that the Site can be personalized based on your preferences or history. We may also use cookies to track information about which pages you visit within the Site to help us gauge the effectiveness of the Site or our content. We may also store other information such as recent searches in your session. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and to help us understand what areas of the Site are of greatest interest to you. Cookies also may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences and password so you do not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. Please be aware that some or all of our cookies may be accessible by third parties.</p>
						<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to stop accepting new cookies, to notify you when you a new cookie is received, and to disable existing cookies. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, however, you may be unable to take full advantage of all the Site’s features.</p>
						<p><u>Log Files</u></p>
						<p>When you are using the Site, we automatically gather basic information from your browser, such as IP address, browser type, ISP, OS, and date/time stamps to analyze trends, administer the site, analyze bugs, and gather broad demographic information.

					<h2>Third Party Contractors and Other Uses</h2>
					<div class="desc full">

Although we endeavor to select only reputable companies who share our commitment to privacy and will restrict how these suppliers or service providers may use or disclose the PII to which they have access, we are in no way responsible for such third parties or their activities. Therefore, you agree to allow us to give your information to third party suppliers and service providers in order for us to provide service to you.

						<p>Certain PII that you provide through the registration process (such as name, location, and profile image) may be accessible and made public through syndication programs, search engines, crawlers, and other similar programs.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>enforce the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use;</li>
							<li>comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or</li>
							<li>protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ambassador, its members, or others.</li>
