</ul>

<p class="body">

              “<b><i>Information Sharing: It’s Your Choice.</i></b>”

<b>Information Shared Outside of MBNA</b><br><br>

We may share all the information we collect with the following types of

<li class="body">Other financial institutions under joint marketing agreements;</li>
<li class="body">Government entities in response to subpoenas or regulatory requirements;</li>

            <p class="body"> MBNA applies opt outs at the account level, not by individual

              holders, and authorized users. MBNA follows these privacy practices

              Your opt out remains effective until revoked in writing. Federal 
              law requires us to provide this notice on an annual basis, whether

              <br>

<b>Tips to Protect Your Information</b><br><br>

MBNA works hard to keep your information secure. You can help by following these tips to protect your information:</p>

<ul>
<li class="body">Store personal information in a safe place and tear up or shred old receipts and account statements before throwing them away.</li>
<li class="body">Protect your PINs and other passwords. Do not share them with anyone unless it's for a service or transaction you request and you are confident the other party will protect the information as you would.</li>
<li class="body">Carry only the minimum amount of identifying information you require.</li>
<li class="body">Pay attention to billing cycles and statements. Inquire if you do not receive a bill.</li>
<li class="body">Check account statements carefully to ensure all charges, checks, or withdrawals are authorized.</li>
<li class="body">Guard your mail from theft. Do not leave bill payment envelopes in your mailbox with the flag up. Instead, deposit them in a post office collection box or at the local post office. Promptly remove incoming mail.</li>
<li class="body">Order copies of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus once a year to ensure they are accurate. The law permits the credit bureaus to charge up to $9.00 for a copy of the report (unless you live in a state that requires the credit bureaus to provide you with one free copy of your report annually).</li>
<li class="body">If you believe you are a victim of identity theft take immediate action and keep records of your conversations and correspondence. While the steps you must take will vary with your individual circumstances, three basic actions are appropriate in almost every case:

<ul><li>Contact the creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently.</li>
<li>Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus:

<ul><li>Equifax: 1-800-525-6285 / P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241</li>
<li>Experian: 1-888-397-3742 /P.O. Box 9532, Allen, Texas 75013</li>
<li>Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289 / P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834</li></ul>

</li>
<li>File a report with your local police or the police in the community where the identity theft took place and get a copy of the police report.</li></ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">
Although many consumers appreciate the convenience and customer service of direct marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li class="body">If you prefer not to receive pre-approved offers of credit, you can opt out of such offers by calling 1-888-5-OPT OUT.</li>
<li class="body">If you want to remove your name from many national direct mail lists, send your name and address to:<br><br>
DMA Mail Preference Service<br>
P.O. Box 643<br>
Carmel, NY 10512<br><br></li>
<li class="body">If you want to reduce the number of telephone solicitations from many national marketers, send your name, address and telephone number to:<br><br>
DMA Telephone Preference Service<br>
P.O. Box 1559<br>
Carmel, NY 10512</li></ul>

<b>Internet Privacy Practices</b><br><br>

<b>Web Site Privacy</b><br><br>

The MBNA Web servers automatically recognize and record the domain name from which you access the Internet and the names of the pages you visit while at an MBNA Web site. The MBNA Web servers do not automatically extract or store your electronic mail address (See E-Mail Addresses below). The information automatically recognized and recorded is not personally identifiable and is used to improve the content of MBNA Web sites and make them more useful.<br><br>

<b>E-mail Addresses</b><br><br>

If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about special marketing offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. This may include, but is not limited to, online services, deposit products, travel offers, and business cards. When we collect your e-mail address, and with each special marketing offer e-mail message we send, we will provide you with the opportunity to tell us that you do not wish to receive special marketing offer messages from us in the future. However, MBNA reserves the right to service your account and communicate with you through e-mail about your account. This may include, but is not limited to, activating your accounts, account past due notices, rates available for cash and balance transfers, adding an authorized user, and the online banking service.<br><br>

<b>Internet Security</b><br><br>

MBNA uses encryption technology to protect certain information sent over the Internet. SSL is an encryption technology known as “Secure Sockets Layer”. SSL encrypts transmissions between two parties and verifies the Web site server you are communicating with. An “s” after the “http” in a Web site’s address indicates that you are attached to a secure server using SSL technology. Additionally, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, Netscape Navigator 4.0, or a higher version of either, a picture of a lock or a key should appear in the lower right hand corner of the browser’s window.<br><br>

<b>Use of Cookies</b><br><br>

Some MBNA Web sites may use a feature of your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are files placed within your browser on your computer’s hard drive by a Web site server. MBNA Web sites may use cookies to facilitate your Internet sessions, to maintain security and to improve our Web sites. For example, MBNA uses cookies to verify your identity, remember your personal settings such as your offer preferences, and to monitor your use of MBNA Web sites to improve our services. If you choose not to enable cookies on your browser, you will not be able to use some of the services offered on MBNA’s Web sites.<br><br>

<b>Advertising Services</b><br><br>

MBNA uses third party companies to serve ads on our Web site and other Web sites. These companies help MBNA execute, optimize, and measure the effectiveness of our online banner advertising programs. These companies use cookies and non-personally identifiable information (for example, information that does not include name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visit to this and other Web sites to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide ads about goods and services that may interest you. If you would like to learn more about these practices, view the privacy notices of these third party companies, or opt out of their use of non-personally identifiable information, <a href="advertising_services.html">
click here</a>.<br><br>

MBNA’s banner advertisements and online applications may contain small graphics with tags in them. These tags are not personally identifiable and work in conjunction with these cookies. These tags allow us to measure the effectiveness and response rates of our advertising.<br><br>

<b>Children</b><br><br>

MBNA Web sites are not directed to children under age 13, and MBNA does not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13.<br><br>

<b>To Further Protect Your Privacy</b><br><br>

While exploring the services offered through MBNA’s Web sites, please be aware that other online retailers, partners, third party Internet sites, and third party services accessible through MBNA’s Web sites, have separate privacy and data collection policies and practices, which are independent of and may be different from MBNA’s policies and practices. MBNA is not responsible or liable for these independent policies and practices and it is your responsibility to review them and decide whether or not they satisfactorily protect your rights.<br><br>

These Internet Privacy Practices were last updated August 23, 2002 and update and replace any previous Internet Privacy Practices from MBNA. We may amend these Internet Privacy Practices at any time, and when such a change is made we will post a revised version on this MBNA Web site. Changes will be effective when they are posted. It is your responsibility to review these Internet Privacy Practices from time to time to be aware of any such changes. Your continued use of this MBNA Web site indicates your agreement to any such changes.<br>
