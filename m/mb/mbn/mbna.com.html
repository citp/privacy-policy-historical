We back our financial products and services with top quality service. Collecting and sharing information about you helps us do this.

<p><strong>Our Security Procedures Protect Your Information</strong></p>

<p>We work hard to keep information secure. For example, our information security policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Govern retention of sensitive information;</li>
<li>Restrict access to information systems; and</li>
<li>Specify password requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our practices and procedures meet federal standards. Further, we share only the information we believe is needed to offer a product or service efficiently. Finally, we restrict the use of such information and require that it be kept secure.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect to Conduct Our Business</strong></p>

<p>We collect information about you to conduct our business and deliver the top quality service you expect. Sources include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information we receive from you.</li>
<li>Information we receive from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies, to verify statements you've made to us, or regarding your employment, credit, or other relationships.</li>
<li>Information about your transactions with MBNA and with other companies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information Shared Within MBNA</strong></p>

<p>We may share all the information we collect within MBNA. For example, we may share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification information (such as name and address);</li>
<li>Transaction and experience information (such as purchases and payments);</li>
<li>Credit eligibility information (such as credit reports); and</li>
<li>Other information.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may tell us not to share credit eligibility information about you within MBNA, as explained below in the section captioned, <em>"<strong>Information Sharing: It's Your Choice.</strong>"</em> Your choice will not affect the sharing of identification and transaction and experience information.</p>

<p><strong>Information Shared Outside of MBNA</strong></p>

<p>We may share all the information we collect with the following types of companies outside of MBNA:
</p><ul>
<li>Financial service companies (like banks, insurance companies, securities broker-dealers, and organizations with which we have joint marketing agreements);</li>
<li>Non-financial companies (like retailers, direct marketers, communications companies, travel companies, and organizations endorsing MBNA);</li>
<li>Companies performing marketing or other services for us (like data processing or direct mail services); and</li>
<li>Other companies (like nonprofit organizations).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share all of the information we collect with companies outside of MBNA as permitted by law.</p>

<p>You may tell us not to share information about you with companies outside of MBNA, as explained below in the section captioned, <em>"<strong>Information Sharing: It's Your Choice.</strong>"</em> Your choice will not affect sharing with:</p>

<li>Other financial institutions under joint marketing agreements;</li>
<li>Government entities in response to subpoenas or regulatory requirements;</li>
<li>Consumer reporting agencies; and</li>
<li>As otherwise permitted by law.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information Sharing: It's Your Choice</strong></p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
We respect your choices related to privacy. You may tell us not to share credit eligibility information within MBNA and not to share information with companies outside of MBNA as described above. <strong>If you wish to opt out of such information sharing, please call our toll-free automated response line at 1-866-751-1255.</strong> We will ask you to verify your identity and the specific accounts to which your opt out applies. Please have your account or reference numbers available when you call. For deposit accounts, please have your Social Security number or Taxpayer Identification number available when you call.</p>
</div>
<p>MBNA applies opt outs at the account level, not by individual Customer. When any person listed on an account opts out, we opt out the entire account. This includes co-applicants, joint account holders, and authorized users. MBNA follows these privacy practices if an account is closed or becomes inactive.</p>

<p>Your opt out remains effective until revoked in writing. Federal law requires us to provide this notice on an annual basis, whether or not you previously opted out. <strong>Please remember that if you previously opted out an account you do not need to opt out that account again.</strong></p>


<p><strong>Important Information for Vermont Customers</strong></p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>The information sharing practices described above are in accordance with Federal law. Vermont law places additional limits on sharing information about Vermont residents so long as they remain residents of Vermont.

<ul>
<li>As permitted by law;</li>
<li>To companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf;</li>
<li>Name, contact and transaction and experience information (such as your account balance and payment history) to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements; or</li>
<li>With the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips to Protect Your Information</strong></p>

<p>MBNA works hard to keep your information secure. You can help by following these tips to protect your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store personal information in a safe place and tear up or shred old receipts and account statements before throwing them away.</li>
<li>Protect your PINs and other passwords. Do not share them with anyone unless it's for a service or transaction you request and you are confident the other party will protect the information as you would.</li>
<li>Carry only the minimum amount of identifying information you require.</li>
<li>Pay attention to billing cycles and statements. Inquire if you do not receive a bill.</li>
<li>Check account statements carefully to ensure all charges, checks, or withdrawals are authorized.</li>
<li>Guard your mail from theft. Do not leave bill payment envelopes in your mailbox with the flag up. Instead, deposit them in a post office collection box or at the local post office. Promptly remove incoming mail.</li>
<li>Order copies of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus once a year to ensure they are accurate.</li>
<li>If you believe you are a victim of identity theft take immediate action and keep records of your conversations and correspondence. While the steps you must take will vary with your individual circumstances, four basic actions are appropriate in almost every case:</li>
   <ul type="circle">
      <li>Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus:</li>
          <ul><li type="square">Equifax(www.equifax.com): 1-888-766-0008 / P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241</li>
              <li>Experian(www.experian.com): 1-888-397-3742 /P.O. Box 9532, Allen, Texas 75013</li>
              <li>Trans Union(www.transunion.com): 1-800-680-7289 / P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834</li>
			  </ul>
		 <li>Contact the creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently.</li>
         <li>File a report with your local police or the police in the community where the identity theft took place and get a copy of the police report.</li>
         <li>File a complaint with the FTC. Complaints can be filed by phone 1-877-IDTHEFT or through the FTC's identity theft Web site at www.consumer.gov/idtheft.</li>
         </ul>
      <li>For more tips from Your Credit Card Companies to help protect you from theft and fraud, call 1-800-337-0590 or go to www.yourcreditcardcompanies.com.</li>
            
</ul>

<p>Although many consumers appreciate the convenience and customer service of direct marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you prefer not to receive pre-approved offers of credit, you can opt out of such offers by calling 1-888-5-OPT OUT.</li>
<li>If you want to remove your name from many national direct mail lists, send your name and address to:
<br><br>DMA Mail Preference Service<br>
	  P.O. Box 643<br>
	  Carmel, NY 10512</li><br><br>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want to reduce the number of telephone solicitations from many national marketers, send your name, address and telephone number to:
<br><br>DMA Telephone Preference Service<br>
      P.O. Box 1559<br>
      Carmel, NY 10512</li></ul>


<p><strong>Internet Privacy Practices</strong></p>

<p><strong>Web Site Privacy</strong></p>

<p>The MBNA Web servers automatically recognize and record the domain name from which you access the Internet and the names of the pages you visit while at an MBNA Web site. The MBNA Web servers do not automatically extract or store your electronic mail address (See E-Mail Addresses below). The information automatically recognized and recorded is not personally identifiable and is used to improve the content of MBNA Web sites and make them more useful.</p>

<p><strong>E-mail Addresses</strong></p>

<p>If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about 
special marketing offers for products and services that may be of interest to 
you. This may include, but is not limited to, rates available for cash and 
balance transfers, online services, deposit products, travel offers, business 
cards and mortgages. When we collect your e-mail address, and with each special 
marketing offer e-mail message we send, we will provide you with the opportunity 
to tell us that you do not wish to receive special marketing offer messages from 
us in the future. However, MBNA reserves the right to service your account and 
communicate with you through e-mail about your account to the extent permitted 
by law. This may include, but is not limited to, activating your accounts, 
account past due notices, adding an authorized user, and the online banking 
service. If you updated your Net Access profile to opt-out of e-mail marketing 
offers, it may take up to 45 days to process your request.</p>


<p><strong>Internet Security</strong></p>

<p>MBNA uses encryption technology to protect certain information sent over the Internet. SSL is an encryption technology known as "Secure Sockets Layer". SSL encrypts transmissions between two parties and verifies the Web site server you are communicating with. An "s" after the "http" in a Web site's address indicates that you are attached to a secure server using SSL technology. Additionally, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, Netscape Navigator 4.0, or a higher version of either, a picture of a lock or a key should appear in the lower right hand corner of the browser's window.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Some MBNA Web sites may use a feature of your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are files placed within your browser on your computer's hard drive by a Web site server. MBNA Web sites may use cookies to facilitate your Internet sessions, to maintain security and to improve our Web sites. For example, MBNA uses cookies to verify your identity, remember your personal settings such as your offer preferences, and to monitor your use of MBNA Web sites to improve our services. If you choose not to enable cookies on your browser, you will not be able to use some of the services offered on MBNA's Web sites.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising Services</strong></p>

<p>MBNA uses third party companies to serve ads on our Web site and other Web sites. These companies help MBNA execute, optimize, and measure the effectiveness of our online banner advertising programs. These companies use cookies and non-personally identifiable information (for example, information that does not include name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visit to this and other Web sites to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide ads about goods and services that may interest you. If you would like to learn more about these practices, view the privacy notices of these third party companies, or opt out of their use of non-personally identifiable information, <a href="advertising_services.html">click here</a>.</p>

<p>MBNA's banner advertisements and online applications may contain small graphics with tags in them. These tags are not personally identifiable and work in conjunction with these cookies. These tags allow us to measure the effectiveness and response rates of our advertising.</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong></p>

<p>MBNA Web sites are not directed to children under age 13, and MBNA does not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13.</p>

<p><strong>To Further Protect Your Privacy</strong></p>

<p>While exploring the services offered through MBNA's Web sites, please be aware that other online retailers, partners, third party Internet sites, and third party services accessible through MBNA's Web sites, have separate privacy and data collection policies and practices, which are independent of and may be different from MBNA's policies and practices. MBNA is not responsible or liable for these independent policies and practices and it is your responsibility to review them and decide whether or not they satisfactorily protect your rights.</p>

<p>These Internet Privacy Practices were last updated August 22, 2005 and update and replace any previous Internet Privacy Practices from MBNA. We may amend these Internet Privacy Practices at any time, and when such a change is made we will post a revised version on this MBNA Web site. Changes will be effective when they are posted. It is your responsibility to review these Internet Privacy Practices from time to time to be aware of any such changes. Your continued use of this MBNA Web site indicates your agreement to any such changes.</p>
