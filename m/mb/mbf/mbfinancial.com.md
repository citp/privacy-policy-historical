### What we do  
  
**How does MB Financial Bank, N.A. protect my personal information?** | To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. 

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.

  * Open an account or provide your account information.
  * Apply for a loan or show us your government-issued ID.
  * Make deposits or withdrawals from your account.



We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.   
  
**Why can't I limit all sharing?** | Federal law gives you the right to limit only: 

  * sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness.
  * affiliates from using your information to market to you.
  * sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more on your rights under state law.
