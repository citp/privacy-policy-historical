</p>
<p>
3.1 All information you provide us with is stored on secure servers in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria. We have taken security measures appropriate to the nature of the information stored and the harm that might come from a breach of security.
</p>
<p>
3.2 The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a place outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

<p>
<b>5. Your Rights Regarding Your Information</b>
</p>
