The Site Administration agrees not to abuse IP address data as well as not to disclose it.

**Our Site makes use of cookies, which is a common practice on the Internet. Cookies are only used for storing technical identification information after the user's authorization on the Site. Cookies are not used to store any other data (logins, passwords, financial or/and other information). Disabling cookies may lead to the inability to access those parts of the Site which require authorization.

The Site Administration agrees not to abuse this data and not to disclose it (unless agreed with the user beforehand).
