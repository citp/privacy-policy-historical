The holidays are here, and that means temptation is all around us! Be sure to plan what you will eat before heading off to the party. Fill up on fruits and veggies before you go. Before picking up that food on the appetizer table that was _not_ on your list, ask yourself _why_ you are wanting to eat it. Is it because everyone else is eating, or maybe to make your best friend happy because she went to so much trouble making the appetizers? If you drink alcohol, be sure to alternate your alcoholic drinks and water or favorite low-calorie soft drink. This will minimize your empty calorie intake. And last but not least, don’t punish yourself if you went overboard. Tomorrow is a brand new day. Just don’t throw in the towel!
