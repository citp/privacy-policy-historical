These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. In addition InfoMedia, Inc. reserves the right to release current or past information in the event InfoMedia, Inc. believes that the information is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if InfoMedia, Inc. is sold or acquired, or when InfoMedia, Inc. deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when InfoMedia, Inc.. in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. "Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for InfoMedia, Inc.'s and/or Third Party Advertisers' services, either via registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing InfoMedia, Inc. collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators.

This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services.
<br><br>1.3 Third Party List Information.
<br>InfoMedia, Inc. collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and InfoMedia, Inc. subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller").

<br><br>1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected using Technology.
<br>InfoMedia, Inc. currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, InfoMedia, Inc. may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
<br>a. Cookies.
<br>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows InfoMedia, Inc.. to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in InfoMedia, Inc.'s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com . Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
<br>b. Web Beacons.
<br>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows InfoMedia, Inc. to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, InfoMedia, Inc. might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in InfoMedia, Inc.'s database, visits the cosmetic website, InfoMedia, Inc. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and InfoMedia, Inc. would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics. InfoMedia, Inc. may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, InfoMedia, Inc. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in InfoMedia, Inc.'s database.
<br>c. New Technology.
<br>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is InfoMedia, Inc.'s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, InfoMedia, Inc. strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for Health 101 to review any updates regarding its use of technology.
<br>d. Usage Tracking.
<br>InfoMedia, Inc. tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.
<br>e. Log Files.
<br>Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.
<br>f. Optional Registration.
<br>InfoMedia, Inc. may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services or Third Party Services.
<br>g. Feedback and Inquiries.
<br>You have the ability to contact InfoMedia, Inc. to provide us with your feedback. InfoMedia, Inc. uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues.

<br>InfoMedia, Inc. may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of InfoMedia, Inc. including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
<br><br>1.7 Individual Information.
<br>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information.
<br><br>1.8 No Information Collected from Children.
<br>InfoMedia, Inc. will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If InfoMedia, Inc. obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, InfoMedia, Inc. has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.
