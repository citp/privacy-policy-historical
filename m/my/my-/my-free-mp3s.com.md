Collection of Data

MyFreeMP3s.com does not collect Internet User identity or contact information from Internet Users' visits to MyFreeMP3s.com websites.

No information is obtained from the Internet User or Internet User's computer to generate the unique identifying number of the Internet User. MyFreeMP3s.com's servers automatically generate the unique number. None of MyFreeMP3s.com's cookies are used to perform "user profiling." 

MyFreeMP3s.com does receive and record partial e-mail addresses of Internet Users, only in circumstances where the Internet User has voluntarily provided its identity and contact information through the Advertiser's website. This partial e-mail address does not enable MyFreeMP3s.com to personally identify an Internet User.
