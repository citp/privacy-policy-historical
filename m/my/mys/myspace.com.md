**About MySpace.com**  
MySpace.com is an online service that allows our members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. MySpace members can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. MySpace members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them. 

MySpace.com cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at privacy@myspace.com 

**Information Collection and Use by MySpace.com**   
MySpace.com collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the MySpace.com service. MySpace.com also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other. 

MySpace.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information, such as IP address and browser type, from all users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. 

User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the MySpace.com social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join MySpace, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on MySpace.com with each other through the MySpace.com service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, MySpace.com allows users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked. 

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" setting to "Do not send me notification emails" in the user "Account Settings". 

From time to time, MySpace.com or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on myspace.com. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. 

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**  
MySpace members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. MySpace.com stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. MySpace.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from MySpace.com may contact MySpace.com to request the removal of their information from our database. 

MySpace members may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal MySpace address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses. 

You may prevent MySpace.com email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK" to [privacy@myspace.com](mailto:privacy@myspace.com) Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block.
