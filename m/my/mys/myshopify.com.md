# Shopify Privacy Policy

## 1\. Introduction

Welcome to Shopify!

This Privacy Policy was written to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your information. Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally update this policy. If a significant change is made, we will be sure to post a notice on our home page and in the merchant admin. If you continue to use Shopify after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.

By signing up for any of the products or services offered by Shopify (together, the “Services”), or dealing with a merchant using Shopify Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the [Shopify Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal). This policy is a legally binding agreement between you (and your client, employer or another entity if you are acting on their behalf) as the user of the Services (referred to as “you” or “your”) and Shopify Inc. (referred to as “we”, “our”, “us” or “Shopify”). If we add any new features or tools to our Services, they will also be subject to this policy.

We will keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date with the information that you provide to us. If you request access to your Personal Information, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as allowed by law, and provide you access to that information.

When we use the term “Personal Information” in this policy, it means any information related to an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

## 2\. Information from merchants

Privacy matters! If you are a merchant, you agree to post a privacy policy on your storefront that complies with the laws applicable to your business. You also agree to obtain consent from your customers for the use and access of their Personal Information by Shopify and other third parties.

What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which may include a unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Every device that accesses our website is assigned a different cookie by us.

### Why does Shopify use cookies?

  * We use cookies to recognize your device and provide you with a personalized experience

  * Our third-party advertisers use cookies to track your prior visits to our website and elsewhere on the Internet in order to serve you customized ads.
  * **Opting out:** You may be able to opt out of customized ads by visiting the [Ads Preferences Manager](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/), and the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](http://www.google.ca/ads/preferences/plugin/). If you use our website without opting out, this means that you understand and agree to data collection for the purpose of providing you with remarketing ads.



The purpose of a cookie is to identify you electronically, store your preferences for viewing our webpages, allow “remarketing” relevant to your interests based on your visits to our site, and show you relevant ads on our website and across the Internet.

Cookies are stored on your device to assist us in providing and improving our Services. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged into your account and we use data collection devices such as Google Analytics to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness and to provide you with information relevant to your interests.

Through first party and third party cookies, third parties may collect information about you while you are visiting Shopify-hosted webpages and other websites. They may use this data to show you advertisements on Shopify-hosted webpages and across the Internet based on your prior visits to these sites. We do not collect this information or control the content of the advertisements that you will see.

## 7\. When and why do we share Personal Information with third parties?

  * Shopify works with third parties to help provide you with our Services and we may share Personal Information with them to support these efforts. In certain limited circumstances, we may also be required by law to share information with third parties. 
    * Personal information may be shared with third parties to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or any other agreement related to the Services, or as otherwise required by law.
    * Personal information may also be shared with a company that acquires our business, whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or other similar transaction or proceeding. If this happens, we will post a notice on our home page.
  * Except when required by law, Shopify will never disclose your Personal Information without obtaining your consent.



Shopify remains responsible for Personal Information that is transferred to a third party for processing or to support our efforts. Any Personal Information transferred to a third party for data processing is subject, by law, to a comparable level of protection as that provided by Shopify.

A “comparable level of protection” means a level of protection generally equivalent to that provided by Shopify.

## 8\. What do we do with your Personal Information when you terminate your relationship with us?

  * We will continue to store archived copies of your Personal Information for legitimate business purposes and to comply with the law.
  * We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to improve our Services.



## 9\. What we don’t do with your Personal Information

  * We do not and will _never_ share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services.
  * We do not use the Personal Information we collect from you or your customers to contact or market to your customers or directly compete with you. However, Shopify may contact or market to your customers if we obtain their information from another source, such as from the customers themselves.



## 10\. How do we keep your Personal Information secure?

  * We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive information, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee details and any other Personal Information entrusted to us. Our information security systems apply to people, processes and information technology systems on a risk management basis.
  * We perform annual audits to ensure our handling of your credit card information aligns with industry guidelines. We are certified as a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant service provider, which is the highest level of compliance available, and our platform is audited annually by a third-party qualified security assessor.
  * No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information.



## 11\. How do we protect your information across borders?

  * Shopify remains responsible for Personal Information that is transferred to a third party abroad for processing or to support our efforts. Any Personal Information transferred to a third party for data processing is subject, by law, to a comparable level of protection as that provided by Shopify. A “comparable level of protection” means a level of protection generally equivalent to that provided by Shopify.

  * In relation to European markets, we also comply with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, disclosure and retention of Personal Information by Shopify Data Processing (USA) Inc. from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. For more information regarding our Safe Harbour Privacy Policy for Shopify Data Processing (USA) Inc.,




  * Generally, Shopify receives Personal Information from the EU or Switzerland as an agent acting on the instructions of its client and in its capacity as a “data processor”, with the client being the “data controller”. In such cases, where Shopify receives Personal Information from the EU or Switzerland merely for processing on behalf of its client, Shopify’s client remains responsible for the Personal Information and its processing in accordance with EU or Swiss law and Shopify will follow its client’s instructions and will co-operate with its client to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles and this Privacy Policy.

  * We will not use Personal Information for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected. Should we envisage uses for your Personal Information not compatible with the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses. Furthermore, we will not disclose your Personal Information unless required by law, and we will notify you of such disclosure unless prohibited by law.

  * Shopify uses the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with the Safe Harbor principles and this Privacy Policy. If you believe Personal Information has been used in a way that is not consistent with this policy or the safe harbour principles, or if you have further questions or concerns related to this policy, please get in touch using the contact information below. If your complaint or dispute remains unresolved, you may also contact the International Centre for Dispute Resolution®, the international division of the American Arbitration Association® (ICDR/AAA). This organization provides independent dispute resolution.
