strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to 
provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject 
to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your 
email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Our 
Commitment To Your Privacy</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your 
privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice 
explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about 
the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, 
we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable 
information may be requested.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How 
we gather information from users</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How 
we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities 
in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you 
may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions 
of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make 
a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and 
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like most Web 
sites, MyShedPlans.com also collects information automatically and through the 
use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, 
we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology 
to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the 
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter 
that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter 
a particular advertisement while visiting our site. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. 
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example 
by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be 
unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your 
user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features 
according to your preferences.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
we do with the information we collect</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like 
other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver 
more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not 
share your information with anyone.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aggregated 
Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in 
many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with 
similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services 
(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). 
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable 
Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on MyShedPlans.com to communicate 
with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service 
and privacy policy; services and products offered by MyShedPlans.com and other 
topics we think you might find of interest.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personally 
Identifiable Information collected by MyShedPlans.com may also be used for other 
purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing 
of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for 
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
information. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to 
time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may 
be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response 
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to 
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, 
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. 
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Affiliated 
sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MyShedPlans.com 
expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our 
users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, 
affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their 
own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your 
visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a MyShedPlans.com 
page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, 
through MyShedPlans.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, 
Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. MyShedPlans.com 
is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should 
check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information 
on a feature or page operated by a third party.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may 
use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences 
or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served 
by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine 
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available 
on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or 
other technology to gather information. MyShedPlans.com does not control the use 
of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible 
for any actions or policies of such third parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable 
Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed 
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. 
Such activities are beyond the control of MyShedPlans.com and this policy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Our 
Commitment To Data Security</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use 
of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial 
procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Our
