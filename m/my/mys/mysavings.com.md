# FeedBlitz Privacy Policy | FeedBlitz

In more or less plain English, this is what our privacy policy says:

  * You have the right to control your personal information.
  * FeedBlitz never sells, rents or buys email addresses.
  * List owners can see the information you give them as part of our services.
  * FeedBlitz uses cookies, tracking and logging to make FeedBlitz work and tell list owners about activity on their lists.
  * FeedBlitz emails globally, but is a US-based business with a US-based infrastructure.
  * You can [set or change your personal privacy and cookie settings](https://app.feedblitz.com/f/?Privacy) at any time.



That’s what all the words below basically mean. It’s consistent with the way we’ve done business over the years. There are links in the policy to third party sites where you can control how analytics and ad networks we participate in treat you.

So the above is the bite-sized summary. But it’s the words below that count (our lawyers made us say that). If you’re using FeedBlitz, as a visitor, publisher or subscriber, you agree to all of this.

Here’s the legally binding part:

## The FeedBlitz Privacy Policy

FeedBlitz, LLC (“FeedBlitz”) respects your privacy. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the treatment of personally identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained from, you in connection with all of the products, software, services, widgets and websites offered by FeedBlitz (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to our publishers, those who subscribe to receive deliveries from FeedBlitz, and anyone else using the Services.  By using or otherwise accessing the Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with this Statement, please do not use our Services.

This Privacy Policy is subject to FeedBlitz’s Terms of Service (the “TOS”), which can be viewed [here](http://feedblitz.com/tos). All terms not expressly defined in the Privacy Policy will have the definition in the TOS.

At any time, if you have any questions or concerns regarding FeedBlitz’s Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@feedblitz.com.

The personal information that you provide for these updates is not shared, other than described in the paragraph above.

Your email address will never otherwise be shared by FeedBlitz with third parties. To prevent spamming, we require all new subscription requests to be confirmed via email (known as confirmed dual opt-in) before they are activated. If you believe your email address was added to a list FeedBlitz powers without your permission or knowledge, you should contact abuse@FeedBlitz.com immediately.

Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may however elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information (e.g. “we had 1,234 visitors yesterday”).
