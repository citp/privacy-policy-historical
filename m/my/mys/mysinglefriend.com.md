We will store your personal information for so long as you are a registered user. After you cease to be a registered user we will keep your personal information on our records for a period of one year to enable us to respond to any queries or complaints that you may have. After this time we may continue to store your personal information, however such personal information shall only be processed where necessary for legal reasons (for example we will need to keep your billing information for 7 years in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs rules) or we have reason to believe that the processing may (i) assist with the detection and/or prevention of crime; and/or (ii) protect your safety or that of a third party.

By providing us with your personal information you consent to our processing your sensitive personal information, such as your sexual orientation, for the above purposes.

We may pass your personal information to third parties who will provide certain elements of our services on our behalf, however all such third parties will be bound to provide at least the same level of protection for your personal information as we provide. Such third parties may be located in countries or jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection as is provided in the United Kingdom. You consent to our transferring your personal information to countries or jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection as is provided in the United Kingdom.

In the event that you (whether on your own behalf or on behalf of someone else) choose to pay for our services you will be required to provide your name, address and card details, which will be passed immediately to our payment provider via a secure link. Your card details are not retained on our database. We will keep your name and address confidential on our secure database and process these in accordance with this Data Protection and Privacy Notice.

We take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is kept secure and is kept for only so long as is necessary for the purpose for which it is used.
