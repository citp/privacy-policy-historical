# Privacy Policy – How can we help you

Hello! Welcome to mySupermarket’s Privacy Policy! Please note that any words which are capitalised have the same meaning as in the [Terms & Conditions](http://help.mysupermarket.co.uk/index.php/knowledgebase/mysupermarket-terms-of-use/)  for use of the Sites and the Service.

We are mySupermarket Limited, Company No 5920495 registered in England with our registered office at Lower Ground Floor, 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W1H 7AP, England.  In this privacy policy, you’ll see us refer to ourselves as “mySupermarket”, “we” or “us” or “our”. 

Throughout this privacy policy, we refer to “GDPR” – which is shorthand for an EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation.  The GDPR deals with:

  * your right to privacy;
  * your rights to information about, and relating to, you – and how it is used; and
  * your rights to data security.



The GDPR approaches these from two directions. On the one hand, it sets out various rules for companies like us regarding their collection and processing of information relating to an individual. (“Processing” here means “use” or “deal with”, and refers pretty much to anything one can do with information about individuals – from storing it in a database, to combining it with other information and building profiles. ) On the other hand, GDPR sets out rights for individuals.  These rights are designed, again, to give you more control over your privacy and information relating to you.

We’ve put together a brief overview of your rights under the law as they are most likely to apply to your use of mySupermarket.  In addition, we recommend that you check out the ICO website, which has more information on your rights.

[Overview of your rights under the law.](http://help.mysupermarket.co.uk/index.php/knowledgebase/individual-rights-under-the-gdpr/)

[ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/)

The GDPR (see, there it is) sets out a limited number of different reasons which allow us, as a company, to collect and process information relating to you.  Each reason is known as a “legal basis to process” and we need one of these for each bit of processing we do. Below, you will find a list of the activities we engage in which involved information relating to you – and we set out the legal basis (you know … that “allowable reason”!) for each activity.

You will note that several of the activities listed are commercial. In other words, we earn money from them.  mySupermarket does not charge individual consumers to use mySupermarket so advertising, data analysis and that sort of thing allow us to keep the lights on and the site up and running.

[See here to learn more about each activity below for any of the 3 GDPR reasons – and why we have classed it as we have.](http://help.mysupermarket.co.uk/index.php/knowledgebase/additional-detail-on-mysupermarket-activities/)

[See here to learn more about the legal bases (that is, those GDPR reasons) themselves, and your rights under each](http://help.mysupermarket.co.uk/index.php/knowledgebase/legal-reasons-why-we-are-allowed-to-deal-with-information-relating-to-you/)[.](http://help.mysupermarket.co.uk/index.php/knowledgebase/legal-reasons-why-we-are-allowed-to-deal-with-information-relating-to-you/)

Reason number 1: We have a contract with you

Because we have a contract with you, we use information relating to you (such as your email address or post code) for contract and account management.  (In other words, we provide you with the website’s services).

Reason number 2: We have your specific and informed consent

We have collected (or not) your specific, informed consent for:

  * Sharing of User activity data with third parties for use in their own targeted marketing, audience building, market research, analysis or other activities; and
  * Targeted advertising on mySupermarket, where the targeting is not conducted by ourselves.



Obviously, if don’t have your consent, we won’t do that stuff (but it helps us pay the bills if you do consent!) Also, if you have given us your consent for each of these, you have a right to withdraw your consent at any time.

Reason number 3: It is in our legitimate interests (we need to market to you to pay the bills!) to do the following:

  * Direct email marketing. (We always allow you to opt-out of this in each email.)
  * Targeted (or “behavioural”) advertising campaigns and promotional activities on the mySupermarket website, where the campaign or activity is conducted by ourselves. _(You can learn more about behavioural advertising at[Your Online Choices)](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/)_



 Other stuff:

We use data for other stuff too – but it’s not data about or related to you and so it’s not regulated by the GDPR. Although the law doesn’t say we need to tell you about this, we believe in being completely transparent with you – so we’re going to tell you anyway!

We carry out:

  * Analyses of aggregated and anonymised User usage and activity data for purposes of site maintenance, development and evaluation. We have no idea from this about anything related to you. (“Aggregated and anonymised” information means information we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed and from which it is not possible to work out individual customer identities.)
  * Market and business research based on aggregated and anonymised User data, for example from seeing how popular one product is in comparison with another. Again, we have no idea from this about anything related to you.
  * Advertising campaigns on mySupermarket where the ads shown are based on the page content (e.g. the products shown on that page) or other factors not based on a User’s personal data. Again, this is shown to you based on information which is nothing to do with you or your preferences or anything else!
  * Affiliate marketing in which we receive commissions from Supermarkets for “referring” customers. We participate in various referral programs under which we receive commissions from Supermarkets for “referring” customers who then complete purchases from their sites.  Some of these are run directly by the Supermarkets. In other cases, a Supermarket may choose to use a third party affiliate network to run their referral programme on their behalf.   When a shopper completes a purchase on the mySupermarket Site which may be eligible for a referral commission, a tracking code provided by the affiliate network or the Supermarket may be placed on the user device.  The code allows the affiliate network to identify shoppers referred by mySupermarket.  Apart from a partial IP address, no information relating to you or transaction data is provided to or collected by the affiliate network from mySupermarket. ****



We collect information relating to you both directly and indirectly.  This data includes:

  * Information relating to you (which we call “personal data”)
  * Activity information data (which we call “activity data”) – which is information about what you do on the Site.



Some items are universal; we collect this information from every person that uses our site, whether they register or not.  Other information is collected only when you register for the site.  And some information is collected on an as-needed basis. That is, if you want to use a feature of the site, we will ask for particular this information in order to provide that feature to you.

_Sensitive Personal Data_

Some information about you is more sensitive than other information about you. “Sensitive” information is defined by the GDPR and includes details such as information related to your health, sexual orientation, religion, race or ethnic origin. As you might imagine, we do not ask you to provide any such sensitive information and we do not need it in order to provide services. However, please be aware that we may be able to infer sensitive personal data about you from the products you select and your other activity on the site – but we do not knowingly make such inferences and we do not keep any records of any of this or use it in any way.

_Surveys_

In addition to the data listed above, from time to time we run surveys of our users so we can learn more about consumer behaviour in general and our users in particular.  These surveys usually include additional demographic data, such as income range or profession. You might be invited to participate. Such participation is always voluntary and it will always be clear from the invitation that this is a voluntary survey, and not information that is required to be provided in order to use our Website. If you do participate, any data provided will be used as part of out for market and business research and analysis only our market research studies only. While we use anonymised and aggregated data as part of our commercial activities, individual data is never sold.  ****
