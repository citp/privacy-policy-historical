<p align="left"><strong>A. General Consent.</strong> VPS respects the privacy of visitors to its websites, potential and actual SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Franchisees, and customers of SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Restaurants. VPS collects information in a fair and non-intrusive manner, and recognizes the need for appropriate protections and management of the information that you provide.

<p align="left"><strong>B. Consent to Share and Disclose Information.</strong> In addition to consenting to VPS’s Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to VPS sharing the Personal and non-Personal Information that you have provided, as described herein.</p>
<p align="left">VPS shares Personal Information and non-Personal Information with the following SUBWAY<sup>®</sup>-related entities:</p>

<p align="left">(2) the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> international purchasing cooperatives: European Independent Purchasing Cooperative (“EIPC”), Latin America and Caribbean Independent Purchasing Cooperative (“LACIPC”), Independent Purchasing Cooperative (Australasia) Limited (“IPCA”), and Middle East Independent Purchasing Cooperative (“MEIPC”), all of which are member-owned and operated entities composed of all of the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Franchisees located in the European Union (EIPC), Latin America and the Caribbean (LACIPC), Australia (IPCA) and the Middle East (MEIPC). For convenience, EIPC, LACIPC, IPCA, and MEIPC are collectively referred to herein as the “Co-op Group”;</p>

<p align="left">(3) Franchise World Headquarters LLC (“FWH”), which provides core business-related services to Doctor’s Associates Inc. (“DAI”), the franchisor of the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> line of restaurants and SUBWAY IP Inc., the owner of the trademark and SUBWAY Restaurant System.

<p align="left">IPC, IPI, the Co-op Group, the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Group, and the FAF Group are together referred to herein as the “Recipients.”</p>
<p align="left">In addition, VPS may also share information, including Personal Information, with companies that provide support services to it, such as credit card processors, mailing houses, web hosts, technical support providers, fulfillment centers, or other service providers, as well as companies involved in enforcing or investigating transactions or business operations, because these companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. VPS limits the use of information shared with these companies to the purpose for which VPS hired them, but VPS does not control these companies.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>C. Consent to International Data Transfers.</strong> VPS and the Recipients are multi-national entities with operations throughout the world. In order for those entities to be able to provide you with suitable goods, services, and promotions, you expressly consent to your Personal Information being transferred and disclosed internationally, including in and outside the U.S, the European Union, the geographical areas serviced by the Co-op Group, the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Group, and the FAF Group, and other jurisdictions, for any purpose relating to SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> operations and programs.

VPS will ensure that any transfer or disclosure of Personal Information to or within such jurisdictions is in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>D. Consent to Electronic Notice If There is a Security Breach.</strong> If VPS or a Recipient is required or wishes to provide notice of unauthorized access of their data security systems or unauthorized access to or processing of your Personal Information, you agree that VPS and/or the Recipient may do so by posting notice on the Websites or sending notice to any email address which VPS or the Recipient has for you, in the good faith discretion of VPS or the Recipient.

<p align="left"><strong>B. Other Details Relating to Website Use.</strong></p>
<ol>

VPS will use the information provided solely in connection with the contest or survey conducted. </li>
<li> <strong>Cookies – Internet User.</strong> “Cookies” are pieces of information that a website sends to an individual’s computer or other electronic device which allow the website to identify users and make their visits to the website more productive. VPS uses Cookies to help improve your future visits to the Websites and to deliver advertisements to you that are based on your likes and preferences as described in Section VII below.             <br> <br> If you do not wish to receive a Cookie, or if you wish to set your browser to warn you each time a Cookie is being sent, or if you wish to disable all Cookies, you can adjust your internet browser settings to accomplish that.

</ol>

For example, in order for VPS to implement the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Card and Rewards Programs, VPS must have access to the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Franchisee’s Personal Information, including but not limited to name, address, and the bank account information provided to establish the SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Franchisee’s pre-authorized SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Card and Rewards Programs account.

<p align="left">VPS uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your Personal Information is safeguarded against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. VPS endeavors to protect your Personal Information by using physical, electronic, and procedural security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in its control. These measures include safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification, and destruction.</p>
<p>VPS safeguards your Personal Information on the internet by using industry-standard practices. While guaranteed security does not exist either on or off the internet, VPS takes commercially reasonable steps to make the collection and security of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The VPS-hosted Websites utilize a variety of different security measures designed to protect Personal Information by users both inside and outside of VPS, including the use of encryption mechanisms, such as Secure Socket Layers or SSLs, password protection, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Information. This helps maintain the confidentiality, privacy, and integrity of your transactions, and helps protect your Personal Information, from loss, misuse, interception, and/or hacking.</p>
<p>VPS also takes commercially reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used, and is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.</p>
<p><strong>B. Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong> VPS and the Recipients will not disclose your Personal Information to any third party except as described in this Privacy Policy, unless you request or otherwise consent to such disclosure, or unless VPS or a Recipient in good faith determines that such disclosure is required or authorized by law or necessary to: (a) comply with legal process served on VPS or the Websites; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of VPS, the Websites, or Website users; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of VPS employees, SUBWAY<sup>®</sup> Franchisees, Website users, and/or other members of the public.</p>
<p><strong>C. Retention of Personal Information.</strong> VPS and the Recipients will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Your consent to VPS’s and the Recipients’ use of your Personal Information for such purposes(s) remains valid after termination of VPS’s relationship with you.</p>
<h1 class="MSCTitles" align="left">VI. VPS Websites and Third Party Websites.</h1>
<p>For your convenience, VPS may include on the Websites links to other websites. VPS provides these links as a convenience only and does not endorse the content or services offered by, or the privacy policies in place at, those other websites. This Privacy Policy only applies to information gathered by or on behalf of VPS through the Websites or otherwise, and does not apply to information gathered through linked websites not operated by or on behalf of VPS, which have their own privacy policies.  VPS has structured the Websites to make it reasonably clear when you leave a Website and enter another website. VPS encourages you to review the privacy policy of each website you visit through a link from the Websites, to ensure you are comfortable with such policy, as it may differ substantially from this Privacy Policy. VPS is not responsible for the conduct or policy of any third party which operates a linked website.</p>
<h1 class="MSCTitles" align="left">VII. Online Predictive Advertising.</h1>
<p>VPS advertises products and services on the Websites. Such advertisements may be in the form of banner advertisements, splash advertisements that appear as you sign-in or sign-out of your account, or other formats. VPS and the FAF Group may use Personal and non-Personal Information collected from you, such as your past browsing history, to deliver advertisements to you that are more directed towards your own likes and preferences. Such information is collected through the use of Cookies as described in Section IV.B.4 above.</p>
<ol type="A">
<li> <strong>Advertising on our Websites.</strong> VPS and the FAF Group use third-party advertising service providers to help determine the advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to you. In order to accomplish that, VPS and the FAF Group share with such advertising service providers Personal and non-Personal Information collected through the Websites via the use of Cookies. VPS and the FAF Group provide such information to advertising service providers for the sole purpose of enabling such service providers to provide advertising services to VPS and the FAF Group.  VPS and the FAF Group limit the advertising service providers’ use of such information to such purpose, but VPS and the FAF Group do not control such service providers. </li>
<li> <strong>Advertising on other Websites.</strong> VPS and the FAF Group also contract with third-party advertising companies to advertise products and services on websites which are not operated by or on behalf of VPS. Some of these advertisements may contain Cookies placed by such advertising companies which permit the monitoring of your response to such advertisements. VPS and the FAF Group authorize the advertising companies to collect Personal and non-Personal Information via Cookies for the sole purpose of providing advertising services to VPS and the FAF Group. VPS and the FAF Group limit the advertising companies’ use of such information to such purpose, but VPS and the FAF Group do not control such advertising companies. </li>
<li> <strong>Electing Out of Online Predictive Advertising.</strong> If you do not want to have your Personal or non-Personal Information used as described in this Section VII, change your Cookie settings as described in Section IV.B.4 above. Please note that even if you disable Cookies, you may still receive online predictive advertising. Disabling Cookies means that the advertisements you do receive will not be based on your likes or preferences. </li>
</ol>
<h1 class="MSCTitles" align="left">VIII. Children and Data Collection.</h1>
<p>VPS cares about the safety of children and adheres to the federal privacy protection standards as stated in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). VPS will not knowingly allow anyone under thirteen (13) years of age to provide VPS with any Personal Information. Children under thirteen (13) years of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any Personal Information about themselves over the internet. If a child under thirteen (13) years of age has provided VPS with Personal Information without the consent of a parent or guardian, the parent or guardian of that child should contact VPS’s Privacy Officer immediately at <a class="NormalLink" href="mailto:privacyofficer@ipcoop.com" target="_blank">privacyofficer@ipcoop.com</a>. VPS will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly delete such child’s Personal Information from its servers.</p>
<h1 class="MSCTitles" align="left">IX. California Privacy Rights.</h1>
<p>Under California law, California residents can now ask companies with whom they have an established business relationship to provide certain information about such companies’ sharing of personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the past year.</p>
<p>VPS’s policy is to share your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes only with your informed consent. With your consent, from time to time, VPS may share your Personal Information with the Recipients for the purpose of marketing and/or promoting goods, services, and programs to you. If you previously provided VPS with such consent but no longer want your Personal Information to be shared, please contact the VPS Privacy Officer at <a class="NormalLink" href="mailto:privacyofficer@ipcoop.com" target="_blank">privacyofficer@ipcoop.com</a> and request a change in your preference and/or opt-out of communications without charge.</p>
<h1 class="MSCTitles" align="left">X. International Data Transfers.</h1>
<p>VPS may transfer the Personal Information it collects about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. Those countries may not have laws which protect Personal Information to the same extent as the country in which you initially provided the Personal Information. When VPS transfers your Personal Information to other countries, VPS will ensure that such Personal Information is protected as described in this Privacy Policy, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h1 class="MSCTitles" align="left">XI. Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”).</h1>
<p>Canada has enacted federal privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), which incorporates ten (10) “Fair Information Principles” regarding your Personal Information. VPS adheres to these Fair Information Principles for Personal Information collected and/or transferred from Canada, which are as follows:</p>

<li> <strong>Principle 6</strong> - Accuracy. Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. </li>
<li> <strong>Principle 7</strong> - Security Safeguards. Personal information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information. </li>

<li> <strong>Principle 10</strong> - Challenging Compliance. An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the fair information principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization’s compliance. </li>
</ul>
