</p><p>
Personal Information
</p><p>
Mysiteseeker.com/C3 Info-Net collects personally identifiable
information from the visitors to our website only on a
voluntary basis. Personal information collected on a
voluntary basis may include name, postal address, email

</p><p>
This information is collected if you request information

</p><p>
Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
</p><p>
We may use cookies to help you personalize your online
experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to
your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of
a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to
a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites
pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie
enables Mysiteseeker.com/C3 Info-Net to recall your specific
information on subsequent visits.
</p><p>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by
modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to
decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
interactive features of the site.
</p><p>
A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor
your journey around a single website or collection of sites.
They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used
by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic.
They may be used in association with cookies to understand
how visitors interact with the pages and content on the
pages of a web site.
</p><p>
We may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and
web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web
site to ascertain how many times you've seen an
advertisement. No personally identifiable information you

they cannot personally identify you with that information on
our web site.
</p><p>
Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google,
which uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google uses the
DART cookie, which enables it to serve ads to our users based
on their visits to this site and other sites on the Web. You
may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the
<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">
Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
</p><p>
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify
you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be
used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions
shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so
choose.
</p><p>

administer the site, to track users' movements around the
site and to gather demographic information about our user
base as a whole.  The information collected is used solely

Release of Information
</p><p>
If Mysiteseeker.com/C3 Info-Net is sold, the information we have
obtained from you through your voluntary participation in
our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale
in order that the service being provided to you may
