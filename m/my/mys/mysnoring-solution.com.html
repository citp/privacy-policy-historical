        <h3>How do we protect visitor information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p>
        <h3>Do we use "cookies"?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
        <p> We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
        <p> You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.</p>
        <h3>Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described below. The term "outside parties" does not include My Snoring Solution. It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>
        <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

        <p> "The My Snoring Solution jaw supporter is the greatest thing to happen for the prevention
          of snoring and OSA since CPAP. No matter your age or body weight, you have a good
          chance that this product will work for you. It has tremendous promise." </p>

        <p> “I ordered your jaw supporter and my wife loves it. It keeps me from snoring, and
          I've recommended it to several of my friends.” </p>

        <p> “We've been married for 21 years. Several times during the night my wife would punch
          me. That was the code for, "Roll over on your side so you quit snoring." I have
          used your "My Snoring Solution" now for 2 nights. My wife reports an amazing difference
          in that I am no longer snoring, on my back or my side, but what has amazed me the
          most is how much better I feel after a night's sleep! Thanks for a great night's
          sleep!" </p>
