##### Custom In-Ear Monitors

We produce high end custom handmade in-ear monitors, such as our Ultimate Ears Pro Series, for professionals and serious audiophiles. When ordered, most Pro devices require user ear impressions either digitized or molds. This information is usually performed by a third party, an audiologist. Impressions are molds taken of your ear canal, and then produced through a 3D printing process which makes the fit better than ever. User impressions are retained in case of loss, re-ordering or if re-production is necessary or until a user requests that they be discarded.
