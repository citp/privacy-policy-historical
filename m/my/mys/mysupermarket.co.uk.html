        <b>Protecting You</b><br>
        <br>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully 
        (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable data protection laws in the UK).<br><br>
        
        We collect information about you to provide you with the best possible service and to provide you with 
        related services and marketing from ourselves (but not from third parties without your consent).<br><br>
        If you agree to register or sign-in to participate in the ipoints Programme on or through the Website, then you agree that 
        you will provide the data that you give to us and that we accrue for that purpose to ipoints for ipoints' own marketing 
        activities to you.
        
        <b>The Information We Require</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Our privacy policy ensures that any information you provide us remains private and secure. To reassure you, 
        below we provide details of the information you provide to us, and how it will, and more importantly, will 
        not be used. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information 
        we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by contacting us 
        (and there may be an administrative fee payable for this). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct 
        it promptly.<br>
        <br>
        Here are some examples of the data we collect and reasons why:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When you start using the Service, you are asked to provide your postcode for delivery - this allows us to identify which 
                supermarkets deliver in your area.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you register for the Service you are asked to provide your name, email address and password - this helps us recognise you when 
                you return so that we can provide you with a faster service. 
            </li>
            <li>
                When you register or sign-in for participation in the ipoints Programme on or through the Website, you need to 
                provide us with your email address, password for your participation in the ipoints Programme, first name, last name, 
                address and postcode, which we will pass on to ipoints for your participation in the ipoints Programme.  We will 
                receive a reference from ipoints that identifies you uniquely, and we use that reference in order to inform ipoints 
                how many points should be attributed to your ipoints Programme account.
            </li>
            <li>
                We keep a record of items you purchased in your favourites list, thus allowing you to shop more quickly on future visits.
            </li>
            <li>
                We keep a record of the contents of your trolley between shopping sessions. This allows you to continue shopping 
                sessions that you may have stopped midway with no need to add again all the items that you already placed in your trolley.
            </li>
            <li>
                We keep a record of the contents of your trolley after you have sent it to a Supermarket.  This is to ensure 
                that you receive the allocation of points attributed by us for your participation within the ipoints Programme.
            </li>
            <li>
                We keep a record of your preferences such as sorting order of items and last shelf you bought in, so you 
                don't need to reset these preferences every time you start shopping.
            </li>
            <li>
                We keep track of your emails and contacts with customer support, so that we can provide you with a 
                responsive and efficient service. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If you import favourites from one of the Supermarkets or if you book a delivery slot from one 
                of the Supermarkets or when you place an order with the Supermarkets (using the Service), 
                we ask you to enter your login details for that Supermarket (usually email and password). 
                You may authorise us to save your Supermarket password access details. If so, we will retain 
                these only to facilitate your speedier interaction with a Supermarket (so that you do not 
                continually have to re-enter such details) and we will not use this information  for any 
                other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                We keep details of your favourites from Supermarkets and details of previous trolleys you have 
                ordered so that we can better display your favourite items to you as part of the Service.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        We collect and track statistical non-personal information about shopping habits, goods and service preferences and selections 
        which customers have made and the likes for the purpose of business research and for the general improvement of the 
        Service.<br><br>
        
        <b>Third parties</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>We will never sell or rent your personal data to anyone else for their marketing purposes without your consent.</b><br>
        <br>
        We may pass your details to our agents and subcontractors to help us with any of our uses of your data set out in this Privacy Policy.  
        For example, we may use third parties to provide us with marketing or customer service assistance.<br>
        <br>
        We may send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area.  
        Some places outside of the EEA may not have adequate data protection laws at all or may offer differing levels of protection of 
        personal information which are not as high as in the UK.  By submitting your data to us, you acknowledge that provided we have 
        used your data in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy, we cannot be held responsible for any use of your data by third parties 
        who receive and process your data. <br>
        <br>
        We may exchange information with third parties (including but not limited to Supermarkets and ipoints) for the purposes of fraud protection.<br>
        <br>
        We may transfer our databases containing your personal information if we sell our business or part of it.  <br>
        <br>
        We may disclose your personal data to third parties without obtaining your prior consent if we are required to do so by law. <br>
        <br>
        The Site may contain advertising of third parties and reference to third party service providers (such as ipoints).  
        Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third parties or other sites, 
        nor for any third party to whom we transfer your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
        <br>

        <b>E-mails we send you</b><br>
        <br>
        Please note that we may e-mail for the following purposes:
        <ul>
            <li>as part of the Service. We send emails to you after registration for the Service, notifying you of your registration details and 
            we also send emails to you after you have sent a trolley, giving you details about that.
            We may also email you with details of how to register or sign-in for your participation in the ipoints Programme.
            </li>
            <li>to offer related services to you. However, in terms of any marketing emails we may send, we will always 
            give you the chance to opt-out (or unsubscribe) from any marketing email from us in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        <b>Security</b><br>
        <br>
        The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security 
        policy and the law. For example, where we hold passwords (e.g. the password allocated as part of the 
        registration process - which may later be changed); your Supermarket access password - if you allow us 
        to do so; your ipoints password – which we send to ipoints; etc.) we hold them using secure encryption. 
        See our <a id="ctl00_PageContent_Security" href="/Administration/Security.aspx">Security section</a> for more details.
        <br>        
        <br>

        <b>Technology</b><br>
        <br>
        We use "cookies", technology to store data in your computer using the functionality of your browser. A lot of websites 
        do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and 
        probably its user) has visited the site before.<br><br>
        You can usually modify your browser to prevent cookie use - but if you do this the Service (and the Website) 
        will not work properly. The information stored in the cookie is used to identify you. This enables us to operate 
        an efficient service and to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to the website.<br>
        <br>
        <b>This Privacy Policy</b><br>
        <br>
        Please note that this Privacy Policy forms part of the
        <a id="ctl00_PageContent_Terms1" href="/Administration/TermsAndConditions.aspx">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> for use of this Website and forms part of the 
        Agreement between you and us. The terms defined in those
