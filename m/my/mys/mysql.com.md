MySQL.com Privacy Policy

* * *

Purpose and Scope

This policy discloses what information we gather about you when you visit MySQL.com or buy product directly from us. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.

Information MySQL AB gathers and tracks

MySQL AB collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us.

Personal information

We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us:

  * When you subscribe to MySQL mailinglists to receive MySQL news and product information, you must provide email address. We never sell or rent your email address you provide when subscribing to our elists. Please note, that MySQL mailing lists are archived by several third party sites and your email address can be found from their archives and MySQL doesn't have control over those archives. 
  * When you order MySQL commercial licenses, or purchase commercial support, or buy training, we add you to our mailing lists and will contact you in MySQL related issues now and then. 
  * When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. 



We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of MySQL AB, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Aggregated tracking information

We analyze visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as pageviews, traffic flow, search terms, and click through. We use this information to improve our sites. We also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with advertisers that can identify an individual user.

Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
