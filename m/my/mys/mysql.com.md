# MySQL AB :: Privacy Policy

## Purpose and Scope

This policy discloses what information we gather about you when you visit MySQL.com or buy product directly from us. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.

## Information MySQL AB gathers and tracks

MySQL AB collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us.

## Personal information

We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us:

  * When you subscribe to MySQL mailing lists to receive MySQL news and product information, you must provide email address. We never sell or rent your email address you provide when subscribing to our lists. Please note, that MySQL mailing lists are archived by several third party sites and your email address can be found from their archives and MySQL AB doesn't have control over those archives.
  * When you order MySQL commercial licenses, or purchase commercial support, or buy training, we add you to our mailing lists and will contact you in MySQL related issues now and then.
  * When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.



We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of MySQL AB, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

## Aggregated tracking information

We analyze visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as pageviews, traffic flow, search terms, and click through. We use this information to improve our sites. We also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with advertisers that can identify an individual user.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

As part of our approach to providing personalized services on our web site, MySQL AB uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server to be stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same page is visited. For example, a cookie is sent when you register or sign in to this site. With your consent, cookies can store information from forms you fill out to create a user profile so that you do not have to re-enter the information each time you visit.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it notifies you whenever a cookie is received so you can decide each time if you accept them or not. However, the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain features and choosing to reject cookies may reduce the functionality of the site. Your browser help should include precise instructions explaining how to define the acceptance of cookies.

Our website also automatically captures IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with the website.

## Services

This site contains links to other sites. MySQL AB is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web Sites.

## Contests & Surveys

We may run contests or surveys on our site in which we ask our users for contact information (like their email address). We use the customer contact information from the entry form to send the user information about our company and its products, or to contact them when it becomes necessary (notices like, updates, patches, etc...). Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below).

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All the data regarding users, their computers' system information and benchmark results are stored on a server. This server is located in a locked and guarded space and only authorized MySQL AB personnel have access to the database containing given user names and passwords.

## Notification of Changes

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on [www.mysql.com](http://www.mysql.com/). If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of their personal information.

## Choice/Opt-Out

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and from our partners at the point where we request information about the user.

This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database so that they no longer receive future communications or access to our other services:

  1. You can send email to <[privacy@mysql.com](mailto:privacy@mysql.com)>, stating your request.
  2. You can reply to any unwanted communications that you receive, stating your request.



## Reviewing personal data

You can review and validate the information, that we have collected about you by sending email to <[privacy@mysql.com](mailto:privacy@mysql.com)> and requesting a review on your personal data.
