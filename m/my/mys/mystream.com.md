# Privacy Policy | Stream

Stream is aware when you visit our site or use our products or services, information is created.  Because we know your privacy is important, we developed this policy to explain what information we collect and how we use and protect that information. We hope that you find the policy useful so that you may continue to enjoy all of our products and services and make informed choices about the information you share.

## Types of Information Collected:

We collect information from you to improve both our relationship with you and the products and services we offer.  This way, we can learn how to improve them or tailor them to your needs.  Some of the information we collect:

  * **_Account Information_** includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and service-related details such as credit card information, payment data, security codes, service history and other information like this needed to service your account.  This is commonly known as “personal identifying information;”
  * _**Performance & Usage Information**_ tells us how you use our mobile and energy services, including other products and services we sell or provide related to those services, how well our services are performing, for forecasting needs (e.g., how much energy you may need during peak and off-peak hours during the day); and information relevant to programs regarding energy efficiency or low-income assistance, should you choose to participate in those programs;
  * _**Web Browsing & Wireless Application Information **_tells us about the websites you visit and the mobile applications you use.  It also helps us to assist you when ordering products or services; and

## Our Privacy Policy for Children:

We want you to know that we don't knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 13 unless we first obtain permission from the child's parent or legal guardian.

## Your California Privacy Rights:

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles California customers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell your personal information to other companies, and we will not share it with other companies for them to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent.

## California Web Site Data Collection & "Do Not Track" Notices:

**Web Site Data Collection:** We do not knowingly allow other parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites when you use our websites and services.

**"Do Not Track" Notice:** Because internet and mobile network providers "do not track" and similar signals do not yet operate according to common, industry-accepted standards, Stream and the networks on which we operate currently do not respond to those signals. For more information on Do Not Track, please visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/ "All About Do Not Track").

California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with these requirements, or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us at [legal@streamenergy.net](mailto:legal@streamenergy.net), or write to us at Stream, 14675 Dallas Parkway, Suite 150, Dallas, Texas 75254.

## Security:

As previously stated, Stream does not sell any information that personally identifies you.  We only keep the information for as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes.  After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or undecipherable.

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via secured technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential.  Some other examples of technology we use to protect your information are:

  * Maintaining and protecting the security of computer storage and network equipment, and our security procedures require employee user names and passwords to access sensitive data;
  * Applying encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect personal identifying information when stored or transmitted by us;
  * Limiting access to personal identifying information to only those at Stream whose jobs require such access; 
  * Requiring caller/online authentication before providing customer account information.  This way, only you or someone who knows your information will be able to access or change the information.
  * Although we strive to keep your personal identifying information secure, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot guarantee that this information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as the result of unauthorized intentional or unintentional acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy).



All of our employees are subject to the Stream Employee Handbook and certain state-mandated codes of conduct. Under the Stream Employee Handbook, all employees must follow the laws, rules, regulations, court and/or administrative orders that apply to our business. Specifically, this includes all legal requirements and Stream policies protecting the privacy of communications and the security and privacy of your records. We take this seriously, and any of our employees who fail to meet the standards in our handbook are subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment. 

Finally, we will make reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that we have experienced a security breach and there is a reasonably likely risk of identity theft, or where notification is otherwise required by law.

## Access to Your Information:

You may contact us ask to review the personal identifying information we have on file to make sure it is correct.

## Future Changes:

In the event of a change in corporate ownership, information about our customers and users, including personal identifying information, may be shared and transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider. This also applies in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which customer and user records would be transferred to another entity as a result of such a proceeding.

We may update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes we make and also to satisfy legal requirements. We will post a prominent notice of the change on our websites.  We will provide you with other appropriate notice of important changes at least 30 days before the effective date.

## Cookies:

## Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI):

Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is information that Stream and other telecommunications carriers obtain when providing your telecommunications services to you. CPNI includes the types of telecommunications services you currently purchase, how you use them, and the billing information related to those services, including items such as the types of local, long distance and wireless telecommunications services that you have purchased and your calling details. Your telephone number, name and address are not considered CPNI.

## Use and Disclosure of CPNI:

We and the telecommunications carriers with whom we operate use your CPNI to offer you additional services of the type you already purchased.  We also may use your CPNI to offer you products and services, packages, discounts and promotions from Stream companies, such as devices, wireless service and other Stream home services, which may be different from the types of services you already purchase.

Stream uses technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of CPNI and protect it from unauthorized access or improper use. Stream does not disclose CPNI outside of the Stream companies or their agents without customer consent except as required or allowed by law. When Stream uses third parties to perform services on its behalf that require the use of CPNI, Stream requires that they protect CPNI consistent with this privacy policy. _Stream does not sell CPNI to unaffiliated third parties._

## Restricting our use of your CPNI:

If you wish to restrict our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes, you may contact a customer service representative at the customer service phone number located on your Stream bill.

Restricting our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes will not affect the provision of any Stream products or services to which you subscribe, nor will it eliminate all types of Stream marketing contacts.
