# Privacy Policy - Mystery Sequels

_Before reading the below privacy policy, let me mention what I know to be true of Mystery Sequels in my own layperson words._

 _Mystery Sequels does not sell any products and currently, it is not advertising on the site at all. The only information collected here are the names and email address (their stored IPs are anonymized by default, which means that the owner of Mystery Sequels has no way of knowing where the users are commenting from) for users who comment on posts and pages through the comments section._

 _There is some information collected through Google Analytics, and that’s pretty much it._

 _Currently there are no Adsense ads on Mystery Sequels, however, in case that they might be added in the future, the paragraphs about it are left in the document below._

 _Having said that, since there is a whole bunch of legalese that needs to be on the site, here goes._
