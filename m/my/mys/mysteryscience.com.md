## Effective: November 15, 2018

This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Mystery Science, Inc. with respect to your access and use of our services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any websites, services or applications operated or provided by other companies that can be accessed through our services.

Any information that is collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you of those changes by posting them on our website, through our services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when those changes will become effective. By continuing to access or use our services after those changes become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.

**Information You Provide**

**Account Registration Information.** We will collect personal information from you (like your name and email address) when you register for an account. If you create an account using your login from another online account (like Facebook), we will access and collect the information about you that you choose to share (which is based on the permissions you give) when you create your account with us.

**Referrals.** Our website offers a tool that allow you to refer colleagues and other contacts to use our website and services by providing their email addresses. We will use the email addresses you provide to send an email inviting the recipient to use our services. This email will come from you to the recipient and the contents of the email will be what you write. If the recipient does not respond to the invitation, we may send a single reminder email from Mystery Science. We may also share anonymous information you provide with our advertising partners to improve the targeting of online advertisements for our services.

**Membership Purchases.** When you purchase a Mystery Science membership, we may collect information necessary to process your transaction, including your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, payment information, such as a credit card number and/or other related information that may be required from you to complete your purchase ("Financial Information").

**Featured Questions.** From time to time, we may want to feature questions and comments from users and students on our website.

Before featuring a student in a video on our website, we will send the teacher a permission form to obtain parental consent for the student to participate in the recording of a video. Participation in this recorded video is optional and will never proceed without a signed parental consent form.
