# Privacy Policy | TransUnion SmartMove

SmartMove is firmly committed to respecting the consumer's right to privacy and has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment.

## The lnformation We Collect from You

TransUnion SmartMove, a service of TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions ("TURSS"), allows you to authorize third party (eg. your landlord’s) access to your credit report, public record information, and related data ("Consumer Report Information") conveniently and affordably through our Web site. We collect your personal information only if you decide to authorize third party access to your Consumer Report Information, purchase one of our products or services, subscribe to our emails or newsletter, participate in one of our contests or surveys or transact other business with us. In order to process your transactions and provide you with quality customer service, we need your full name and current and/or billing address, your email address (so we can contact you) and, if you are requested to pay for a third party's access to your Consumer Report Information, a valid credit card number, your Social Security number and certain other personal information, such as your date of birth, address information, employment information, and certain credit card and loan account information. We use personal information to authenticate the credit card number and to confirm that the person requesting your Consumer Report Information really is you and not an impostor or other person improperly seeking to access your information. 

## What Security Measures We Take

TURSS takes precautions to secure your personal information. If and when we ask you to provide your personal information, we will do so through a Web page that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This protocol provides security for your information by encrypting it as it travels from your computer to our computer. For security purposes we then move all of the personal information that we collect or obtain about you, including your Consumer Report Information, to an environment on our proprietary network that has controls in place to limit access to and secure the data maintained therein.

## How We Use and Share Your Personal lnformation

Unless you indicate to us that you are not interested in receiving information regarding other products and services your name, e-mail address, and/or other contact information may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. Personal information that is shared with these entities will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. If you prefer not to receive such information, you may indicate your preference by contacting TURSS when you register for Smartmove, place an order or update your account information, and TURSS will not send you any promotional materials.

## Emails

For SmartMove Renters that are requested to pay for a third party's access to your Consumer Report lnformation, we will email you a receipt of your purchase. Additionally, the SmartMove service will facilitate communication between you and the third party for whom you have authorized access to your Consumer Report Information—this communication will be provided both through the SmartMove website and through emails. These emails are part of the SmartMove service and cannot be disabled.

## Ordering

When you agree to share your Consumer Report Information, TURSS will share that information with the identified third parties. TURSS also must share some of your personal information with third parties in order to process your transaction. For example, TURSS must share your name, address and social security number with one or more of the national credit reporting agencies in order to obtain your requested Consumer Report Information, and must share your name, address and credit card account number with our credit card processing partner in order to process your payment. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services to TURSS.

## Third Parties 

Unless you indicated to us when you registered, placed an order or updated your account that you were not interested in receiving information about products and services provided by TURSS and its marketing partners, your name, email address, and/or other contact information may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. These entities are only allowed to use shared information for the intended purpose only and will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. Your information also may be used to serve relevant ads to you when you visit the site.   
TURSS may disclose your personal information to third parties other than the landlord in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with, or be responsive to, legal process served on us (such as a subpoena), or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of TURSS, our users or others. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to consultants, agents and advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is within the scope of their professional duties to TURSS and with the understanding that such professionals will abide by our security and confidentiality policies.   
In the event that you unsubscribe from email communications, we may share your email address with our compliance agents or approved marketing partners to prevent you from receiving additional offers. 

## Updating Your Consumer Report Information

TURSS is not responsible for and cannot amend the information in your credit report, which is produced by one or more consumer reporting agencies. If you believe that some of the information in your credit report is inaccurate, you must contact the applicable consumer reporting agency directly.
