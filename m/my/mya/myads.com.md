# Rubicon Project Privacy Dashboard and Opt-Out - Rubicon Project

Last Updated: February 29, 2016

Our Privacy Dashboard is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use information about you and your device so that you can make informed decisions when using our website and interacting with our products and services.

Only 22% of Internet Users regularly review privacy policies for the sites they visit. That is why this Dashboard does not look like other privacy policies you may have seen. Unlike the average privacy policy which is approximately 2,500 words, the Rubicon Project offers this simple summary.

Like any summary, however, the Privacy Dashboard is not an exhaustive description of our privacy practices and should not be construed to define or limit the scope or extent of our Privacy Policies which can be found at the locations identified below.

**Data We Collect**

Rubicon Project collects personal information about its users that they voluntarily provide via email or via registration for certain services or newsletters.

Rubicon Project also collects information about you and your device in order to provide you with more relevant advertising. Some of this information, including for example your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere, but this data does not contain any “real world” identifiers such as your name, address, or contact details. When we collect this information through our advertising technology, we use it to help our customers deliver online advertising to you.

**How We Use The Information We Collect**

Rubicon Project uses the information that we collect to provide you with services that you have requested, and to enable our customers to deliver advertisements that we or they believe will be of most interest to you, as well as to prepare aggregate reports that summarize activity and performance.

**Data Sharing**

Rubicon Project may share data with third parties for a variety of reasons, including our third-party advertiser customers, so that they can deliver targeted advertisements to you.

**Changes**

We may change our privacy policies from time to time in order to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we do, we will give you notice of any material changes by posting the revised privacy policy on this website and, where appropriate, by other means.

**Data Transfers for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)**

Rubicon Project works with customers and consumers throughout the world, including in the European Economic Area (EEA). If you are a resident of the EEA, your personal data is processed by our UK subsidiary The Rubicon Project Ltd., which is registered with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (registration no.
