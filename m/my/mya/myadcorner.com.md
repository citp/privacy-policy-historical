##### How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers’ database only. It can be accessed by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and they in turn are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

##### Do we use cookies?

Yes, we do use cookies for improving the responsiveness of the sites for our users. Cookies are small files transferred through a site or its service provider to your computer’s hard drive via your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service provider systems to recognize your browser; and as a result capture and remember certain information. With the help of cookies, we are able to assign a unique random number (User ID) as user identification by collecting information. We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you every time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone or by contacting directly through our customer service.
