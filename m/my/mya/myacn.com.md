The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (FAQs) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy European Union (EU) law requirements for adequate protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States.  ACN adheres to these Safe Harbor Principles, as outlined below.

**Notice and Choice:** When ACN collects personal information from customers in the EU, ACN will inform them about the types of personal information it collects from them, the purposes for which ACN collects and uses it, and the types of third parties to the information may be disclosed.  ACN will inform the customers about the choices and means that ACN uses of limiting the use or disclosure of such information.

**Data Integrity:** ACN seeks to ensure that any personal information held about EU individuals is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained. ACN collects personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be processed. EU individuals have a responsibility to assist ACN in maintaining accurate, complete and current personal information about them.

**Transfers To Third Parties:** ACN will only transfer personal information about EU individuals to third-parties where the third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to ACN that it will protect the information consistently with this Statement; or (b) is located in the EU or a country considered "adequate" for privacy by the EU Commission; or (c) the third-party has also certified to the Safe Harbor, and is accordingly independently responsible for complying with the Safe Harbor requirements.

**Access and Correction:** Upon written request to ACN, ACN will provide EU individuals with reasonable access to their personal information.  Except as may be subject to legal limitation, ACN will make reasonable steps to allow EU individuals to review their information for the purposes of correcting their information.
