This privacy policy describes the privacy practices of GRAPHISOFT’s websites, as well as our products, online services and applications that include a link to this policy. This privacy policy also applies to GRAPHISOFT’s marketing and advertising practices. Please also see the [GRAPHISOFT Terms of Use](http://www.graphisoft.com/info/legal/terms_of_use/) and product specific End User License Agreements that may apply to the website or application you are using.

### What information does GRAPHISOFT collect about you?

#### GRAPHISOFT ID, Registration and Customer Support

When you register to use a GRAPHISOFT website or application, create a GRAPHISOFT ID, or contact us for support or other offerings, GRAPHISOFT collects information that identifies you. This may include your name, company name, email address and country. We may also sometimes collect other information that does not identify you. Some of this information is required and other information is optional. For obtaining certain student and teacher licenses of our applications, further information regarding your eligibility is required. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law.

#### GRAPHISOFT Websites and Applications

We collect information about how you use our websites and applications. We may collect information that your browser or device typically sends to our servers whenever you visit a GRAPHISOFT website, or when a GRAPHISOFT desktop product or application feature takes you online (as when you visit Online help). For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us where you are located) and the type of browser and device you used. When you visit a GRAPHISOFT website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our website (referral url). To collect this information, GRAPHISOFT may use cookies and similar technologies, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the website or application. Depending on the website or application, this information may be anonymous (for example, see the [GRAPHISOFT Customer Experience Improvement Program](http://www.graphisoft.com/info/legal/license_agreements/ceip/ceip_int_15.html)) or it may be associated with you ([MyARCHICAD website](https://myarchicad.com/)).

#### GRAPHISOFT Emails

Emails we send you may include technologies that tell GRAPHISOFT whether you have received or opened the email, or clicked a link within the email. If you do not want us to collect this information from GRAPHISOFT marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving GRAPHISOFT marketing emails on the "[my profile](https://graphisoftid.graphisoft.com/#/profile)", or a similar feature of the website or application you are using.

#### GRAPHISOFT Online Advertising

GRAPHISOFT advertises online in a variety of ways, including displaying GRAPHISOFT ads on websites and in apps. We collect information about which ads are displayed, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ad was displayed, and which campaign has generated certain user actions - such as web page views and web page interactions, mobile app interactions, mobile app purchases, file downloads, contact form submissions or registration to GRAPHISOFT’s online services.

#### Buttons, Tools, and Content from Other Companies

GRAPHISOFT websites and applications may include buttons, tools, or content that link to other companies’ services (for example, a Facebook "Like" button). We may collect information about your use of these features. In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view a GRAPHISOFT web page containing them, some information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company. Please read that company’s privacy policy for more information.

#### Social Sign-on Services

You may be able to sign in to a GRAPHISOFT website or application using a social networking account, such as a Facebook and Google account. We may collect information when you use these sign-on features.

Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third-party ARCHICAD add-on.

### What are cookies and how does GRAPHISOFT use them?

A cookie is a small piece of information that will be stored on your hard disk until you delete it. Like most websites and applications, we use our own cookies and those of third parties, together with similar technologies, to make our websites and applications work, to offer you customized and personalized service, and to learn more about our users and their likely interests.

GRAPHISOFT and third-party vendors including Google and Facebook use first-party and third-party cookies and related user behavior tracking technologies to measure desktop software, mobile application and website usage; record different user activities in its software and on its web sites; and display advertisements based on the user’s previously recorded activities. GRAPHISOFT does not disclose any personally identifiable information to these third-party vendors. However, third-party vendors automatically receive IP addresses when activity tracking occurs. GRAPHISOFT may connect user activity data gathered by third-party vendors with information collected by its websites and applications.

You can set your browser so that the browser informs you about cookies or automatically prevents their storage. If you do not store our cookies, you will still be able to visit our website or use our services; however, the use of individual offers or features might be limited.

You can also prevent your data from being used by third-party vendors by installing browser extensions, such as:

  * <http://www.aboutads.info/PMC>
  * <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>



Or setting your preferences at web sites like:

  * <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices>

### Does GRAPHISOFT share my personal information?

GRAPHISOFT works with companies that help us run our business. These companies provide services such as delivering customer support and sending emails on our behalf. In some cases, these companies have access to some of your personal information in order to provide services to you on our behalf. They are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes.

GRAPHISOFT may also share your personal information:

  * If you agree to the sharing:
    1. with our subsidiaries and
    2. with our resellers and other sales partners if you are a business customer and agree to receive GRAPHISOFT marketing communications. Note that we do not share personal information about consumers with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless the consumer agreed to that sharing.
  * If we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or respond to fraud, defend our websites or applications against attacks, or protect the property and safety of GRAPHISOFT, our customers and users, or the public.



We may share or publish aggregate information that doesn’t specifically identify you, such as statistical information about visitors to our websites or statistical information about how customers use our applications.

### Is my personal information displayed anywhere on GRAPHISOFT’s websites or applications?

There are several places on GRAPHISOFT’s websites and applications that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you might be able to limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other members of the website or application. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within a website or application that allows you to control who sees your post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and applications, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.

To remove content you have shared on our websites and applications, please use the same website or application feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please .

### Is my personal information secure?

We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and GRAPHISOFT cannot ensure or warrant the security of your personal information.

### Where does GRAPHISOFT store my personal information?

Your personal information and data files are stored on GRAPHISOFT’s servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. Your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world (for example, Germany, Ireland, the United States).

### How can I review or update my personal information or close my GRAPHISOFT ID account?

Many of our websites and applications allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the "[my profile](https://graphisoftid.graphisoft.com/#/profile)," or a similar feature of the website or application you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our online services by logging in and using the deletion functions they make available.
