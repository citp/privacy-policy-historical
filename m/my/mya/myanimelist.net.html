<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div id="rightcontent"><div style="padding: 0 8px;">
<p>This privacy policy was last modified on June 12, 2008. </p>

<p>MyAnimeList.net ("Site," 
"we," or "us") knows that you care how information 
about you is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy explains what information 
of yours will be collected by Site when you use Site and related services 
(the "Service"), how the information will be used, and how 
you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. 
  We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described 
in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<div class="normal_header">Information We Collect</div>
<p><b>User-Provided Information:</b> 

 You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail 
address, when you register with the Service.  If you correspond with 
us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your 
email address and our responses. </p>
<p><b>Cookies Information:</b> 
 When you visit Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text 
file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer 
that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Site help you log in 
faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie does not 
collect personal information about you.  Site uses both session cookies 
and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive 
after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your 
browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be 
removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie 
is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset 
your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie 
is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function 
properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p><b>Log File Information:</b> 
 Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each 
time you access a web page.  When you register with or view our site, 
our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser 
sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include 
information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") 
address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, 
domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p>Clear Gifs Information:  When 
you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which 
are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. 
 No personally identifiable information from your Site account is collected 
using these clear gifs.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based 
emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. 
 The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the 
effectiveness of our marketing, and make us better for our users. </p>
<div class="normal_header">How We Use Your Information</div>

<p>We use the personal information 
you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and 
functionality of the Service.   </p>
<p>Any personal information or 
content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service (for 
instance, in User Content you post) becomes available to the public. 
 If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and 
archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>By providing Site your email 
address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related 
notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication 
by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other 
messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or 
special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you 
may opt out by sending an email message to <a href="mailto:webmaster@MyAnimeList.net" target="_blank">webmaster@MyAnimeList.net</a> with the word "No email" 
in the subject field.  Opting out may prevent you from receiving email 
messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  </p>
<p>Site may use certain information 
about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual 
to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the 
Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining 
security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.  </p>
<p>Site reserves the right, but 
has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the site. 
Site has the right to remove any such information or material for any 
reason or no reason, including without limitation, if in its sole opinion, 
such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable 
law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or defend its rights 
or property or those of any third party.  Site also reserves the right 
to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>
<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, 
and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will 
not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit 
the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; 
(c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate 
metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or 
fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are 
associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company 
or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you 
sign in.</p>

<div class="normal_header">How We Share Your Information</div>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable 
Information:</b> Site will not rent or sell your personally identifiable 
information to others.  Site may share your personally identifiable information 
with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. 
 If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound 
by this Privacy Policy.  We may store personal information in locations 
outside the direct control of Site (for instance, on servers or databases 
co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>As we develop our business, 
we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and 
visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets 
in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information 
in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.  </p>
<p>Except as otherwise described 
in this privacy statement, Site will not disclose personal information 
to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if 
we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, 
comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, 
prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; 
(b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, 
to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or 
allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect 
the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect 
the rights, property, or personal safety of Site, our users or others.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information:  We may share non-personally identifiable information (such 
as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, 
number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand 
the usage patterns for certain Site services.</p>
<p>Site allows other companies, 
called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements 
on the Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology 
to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that 
appear on Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this 
happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, 
or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements 
and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
<p>Site does not provide any personally 
identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks 
without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks 
Site to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond 
to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that 
you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. </p>

<p>You should consult the respective 
privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The 
Site privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities 
of, such advertisers. </p>

<div class="normal_header">How We Protect Your Information</div>
<p>Site uses commercially reasonable 
physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity 
and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure 
or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Site and 
you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, 
Site makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of 
our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that 
such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed 
by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 
  </p>
<p>To protect your privacy and 
security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) 
to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. 
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password 
and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications 
from Site, at all times.</p>

<div class="normal_header">Compromise of Personal Information</div>
<p>In the event that personal 
information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Site 
will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been 
compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth 
in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<div class="normal_header">Your Choices About Your Information</div>
<p>You may, of course, decline 
to submit personally identifiable information through Site, in which 
case Site may not be able to provide certain services to you.  </p>

<div class="normal_header">Children's Privacy</div>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young 
children is especially important.  For that reason, Site does not knowingly 
collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 
13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, 
please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your 
name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 
13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Site. In 
the event that we learn that we have collected personal information 
from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, 
we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe 
that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please 
contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@MyAnimeList.net" target="_blank">webmaster@MyAnimeList.net</a>. </p>

<div class="normal_header">Links to Other Web Sites</div>
<p>We are not responsible for 
the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor 
the information or content contained therein.  Please remember that when 
you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy 
Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any 
other Web site, including those that have a link on our Web site, is 
subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over 
those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

<div class="normal_header">Notification Procedures</div>
<p>It is our policy to provide 
notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are 
for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, 
written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such 
notice on our Website page, as determined by Site in its sole discretion. 
We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications 
to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification 
as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<div class="normal_header">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</div>
<p>If we change our privacy policies 
and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you 
aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances 
we may disclose it.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when 
they are posted on this page.   </p>

<p>If you have any questions about 
this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with 
this Web site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@MyAnimeList.net" target="_blank">webmaster@MyAnimeList.net</a>, or send mail to:</p>
