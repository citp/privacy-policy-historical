            </b>ACN  complies with all Federal laws and regulations, including the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires the consent of  a parent or guardian for the collection of personally identifiable  information from children under 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Safe Harbor</strong><b><br>
              </b>The United States Department of Commerce has agreed with the  European Commission and Switzerland on sets of data protection principles and  frequently asked questions (FAQs) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy European  Union (EU) and Swiss law requirements for adequate protection of personal  information transferred from the EEA or Switzerland to the United States.&nbsp;  ACN adheres to these Safe Harbor Principles, as outlined below.<br>
              <strong><br>
              Notice and Choice:</strong> When ACN collects personal  information from customers in the EU or Switzerland, ACN will inform them about  the types of personal information it collects from them, the purposes for which  ACN collects and uses it, and the types of third parties to the information may  be disclosed.&nbsp; ACN will inform the customers about the choices and means  that ACN uses of limiting the use or disclosure of such information.<br>
              <strong><br>
              Data Integrity:</strong> ACN seeks to ensure that any  personal information held about EU and Swiss individuals is accurate, complete,  current and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the  information was obtained. ACN collects personal information that is adequate,  relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be processed. EU  and Swiss individuals have a responsibility to assist ACN in maintaining  accurate, complete and current personal information about them.<br>
              <strong><br>
              Transfers To Third Parties: </strong>ACN will  only transfer personal information about EU and Swiss individuals to  third-parties where the third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to  ACN that it will protect the information consistently with this Statement; or  (b) is located in the EU, Switzerland, or a country considered  "adequate" for privacy by the EU Commission or Switzerland, as  applicable; or (c) the third-party has also certified to the applicable Safe  Harbor, and is accordingly independently responsible for complying with the  Safe Harbor requirements.<br>
              <strong><br>
              Access and Correction: </strong>Upon written request to  ACN, ACN will provide EU and Swiss individuals with reasonable access to their  personal information. &nbsp;Except as may be subject to legal limitation, ACN  will make reasonable steps to allow EU and Swiss individuals to review their  information for the purposes of correcting their information. <br>
            <strong><br>
            Enforcement:</strong> ACN uses the self-assessment  approach to maintain compliance with its Privacy Policy.&nbsp; ACN periodically  verifies that its policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information  covered, displayed appropriately, implemented and in conformity with Safe  Harbor Principles.&nbsp; ACN also encourages individuals covered by this  Statement to raise any concerns about our processing of their personal  information by contacting the ACN Privacy Officer at the address below or the  ACN Legal Department.&nbsp; ACN will seek to resolve any concerns.&nbsp; In the  event a dispute arises that the parties cannot resolve, the parties may resolve  it through arbitration with the American Arbitration Association program  developed to assist in the compliance with Safe Harbor.&nbsp; The arbitration  shall be held in Concord, North Carolina before a panel of three arbitrators,  each side choosing one and then the two choosing the third.&nbsp; All claims  hereunder brought within two years of the date of which the facts or  circumstances giving rise to the claim are alleged to have happened.&nbsp; Law  of the state of New York will apply to the resolution of the dispute unless  otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
            <strong>Limitations:</strong> Adherence to this  Privacy Policy may be limited to the extent required to meet a legal,  governmental, national security or public interest obligation.<br>
            <br>
          <p align="left">Should you have  any questions with respect to the ACN Privacy Policy (Safe Harbor) or  if you do not consent to, or would like to limit, the manner in which  information about you is collected, used or disclosed, please contact  the ACN Privacy Officer in writing at ACN Inc., 1000 Progress Place,  Concord, N.C. 28025-2449.</p></td>
