more about our privacy policy. Antietam Cable Television, Inc.'s

rights to the information collected at this site. However, in 
the event that we are involved in a sale of a substantial portion 
of our business assets, customer information may be among the 
transferred assets.</p>

<p><b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b></p>

<p>The purpose of Myactv.net Privacy Policy is to inform you of 
ACT's practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure 
of personally identifiable information, and aggregate information 
that is anonymous (such as your IP address). Personally identifiable 
information is information that allows us to contact you (name, 
home address, home and work telephone numbers, e-mail address, 
interests, age, gender and income). This policy supplements our 
Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), which we also urge you 
to read. By using our website and the Service, you agree to be 
bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and by our AUP. </p>
<p>This policy does not apply to practices of companies that ACT 
does not own or control or to people that ACT does not employ 
or manage. </p>

<p><b>The Cable Privacy Act</b></p>

<p>In addition, as an ACT cable customer, you are entitled under 
federal law to a statement about our collection and use of certain 
information that we learn about you. That information is required 
to be provided in a separate written statement and is therefore 
attached to this Privacy Policy as <a href="privacy_policy_annexa.html">Annex A</a>.</p>

<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>

<p>We collect personally identifiable information when you when 
you register for the Service, take surveys, and when you enter 
promotions, sweepstakes or contest. We may receive personally 
identifiable information from our business partners. </p>

regarding our subscribers: name; home address; home and work telephone 
numbers; e-mail addresses; interests; age; gender; billing and 
credit card information; payment and credit records; social security 
or drivers license number; levels of service subscribed to; software/hardware 
used; web site addresses.</p>

<p>Web servers serving our web site may automatically track information 
about which pages you visit on our server, as well as your IP 
address or domain name. This information may be used for our internal 
web site business purposes, for example, to tailor our web site 
content or to assess the amount of traffic to our web site. We 
may also provide this information on an aggregated, anonymous 
basis to our advertisers.</p>

<p>We use information for the following general purposes: to customize 
advertising and content and contact you about specials and new 
products. </p>

<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>

<p>We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information 
to anyone. </p>

<p>From time to time we may share your personally identifiable information 
with other businesses, including our marketing partners and advertisers 
or companies who work on behalf of ACT to provide the product 
or service that you requested. If you object to such use of information 
you have submitted, you will have the opportunity to indicate 
your objection when entering such information or you may contact: 
webmaster@myactv.net.</p>

<p>We will provide your personally identifiable information (i) 
to comply with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act or any other law; (ii) to enforce 
our AUP; (iii) to protect the integrity of ACT's operations; (iv) 
to protect our customers; or (v) to prevent a crime. You expressly 
grant ACT permission to disclose personal information to respond 
to subpoenas, court orders, civil investigative demands or other 
legal process.</p>

<p><b>IP addresses and Log Files</b> </p>

<p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our 
server, administer our website, analyze trends, track users' webpage 
movements on our servers, and to gather broad demographic information 
for aggregate use. We may also log SMTP and POP information.</p>

<p><b>Cookies </b></p>

<p>From time to time, we may place a "cookie" on your 
computer. A cookie is a file written to your computer's hard drive 
that records certain technical information about your Internet 
usage, such as your IP address, browser type, or domain name. 
Also, if you submit personal information to our web site (such
