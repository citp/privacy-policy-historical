<p class="articletitle">Article Directory Privacy Policy</p>

<p> MyADSPost.com  strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
<p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,


 MyADSPost.com

also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.</p>
<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and we do not share your information with anyone.
  Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.
  We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on


 MyADSPost.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by


 MyADSPost.com

 and other topics we think you might find of interest.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by


 MyADSPost.com

may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p><strong>Interest-based advertising</strong></p>
<p>Interest-based advertising enables advertisers to reach users based on their interests (e.g. 'sports enthusiasts') and allows them to display ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser websites.
The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. When users visit an AdSense publisher's website and either view or click an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help AdSense publishers serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web more effectively.
</p><li>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.</li><br>
<li>Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.</li><br>
<li>Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.</li><br>

The user information that Google gather from AdSense sites is used in accordance with Google's <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. It is not used to identify users personally and Google don't display ads based on personal information. Google also will not display ads based on sensitive information or interest categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health or sensitive financial categories, without a user's opt-in consent.
