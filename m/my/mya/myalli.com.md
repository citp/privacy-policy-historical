# GlaxoSmithKline Internet Privacy Statement

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) respects the privacy of visitors to its web sites and is committed to the protection of their personal information. This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of the GlaxoSmithKline site (the “Site”). 

**Binding Nature**  
By accessing and using the Site, you agree and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Statement. 

**Description of the information GSK may collect**

**1\. Personally Identifiable Information**  
GSK collects personally identifiable information (i.e. information from which you can be identified, such as name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) only when it is asked for and/or you voluntarily submit it to us on this Site. We may use the information to respond to your requests, improve our level of service and the content of our web site; provide you with tips, helpful information, product news and updates; notify you of new GSK products and services; seek your views on our products and services; and for our own internal purposes. 

This Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this Site from visitors in that age group without the explicit consent of a parent or guardian. 

**2\. Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
GSK also collects non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our web sites, the number of visitors to each page of our web sites, and the domain names of our visitors' internet service providers. We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use our web sites so that we may improve them and the services we offer. We may also share this information with other companies within the GlaxoSmithKine group and with other third parties. NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROCESS. 

**Use of IP Addresses**   
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your organisation's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. 

GSK, or third party companies acting on behalf of GSK, may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration and to audit the use of our site. We do not ordinarily link a user's IP address to personally identifiable information of that user, which means each user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we may use IP addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the site's terms of use, or to protect our service, site or other users. 

**Cookies**  
This Site uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site or help us analyze usage of the Site more accurately. For instance, our server may set a cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which cookies are used, we will not collect personally identifiable information without your explicit permission. The only personally identifiable information GSK collects is the information you voluntarily provide.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web Browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored, if you prefer. Please refer to your Internet Browser’s instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this Site or any other web sites that you visit.

If you wish to disable GSK’s ability to track your website interactions, you have the ability to Opt-out of our third party tracking software. Visit [http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html?return_url=&javascript_enabled=true](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html?return_url=&javascript_enabled=true) and follow the Opt-Out Policy Instructions. The opt out process will require that you permit the placement of a cookie on your computer that indicates that you do not wish to be tracked by GSK. In the event you remove your cookies from your computer, tracking will resume. 

**How we protect your personal information**  
GSK is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. GSK uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide to GSK on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we make every commercially reasonable effort to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. 

**Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties**  
GSK will not sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third party for any purpose. Sometimes selected third parties are however used to provide GSK with support services in connection with its web sites and such parties may, from time to time, have access to your information to enable them to provide those services to GSK. Please rest assured that all companies providing such support services are required by GSK to meet the same standards of data protection as GSK and are prohibited from using the information for their own marketing purposes.

In certain special cases, we may disclose your personally identifiable information in the following circumstances:

|   | 1\. when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with GSK's rights, property or operations, other users of this site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or   
---|---  
  | 2\. when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.   
  
Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in your country of residence or any other country in which GSK or its affiliates, subcontractors or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any transfer of information outside of your country of residence. GSK will ensure that if information is transferred outside your country of residence, it will still be treated in accordance with this privacy statement.

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
This Site may provide links to other GSK and third party web sites as a service to our users. The privacy statement described here does not apply to those sites. **Please ensure you check the legal and privacy statement posted on each site you link to.**

**Changes**  
We may occasionally update this privacy statement. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to the privacy statement and any updates.
