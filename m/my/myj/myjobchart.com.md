For example, to create an account we will collect a parent’s name, email address, password, and zip code; to facilitate payments for our Services and to a parent’s or a relative’s child through our Services we will collect bank account, or other similar financial information, and address. We will also collect any information that a parent voluntarily provides to us, such as gender, date of birth, cell phone number, responses to surveys or questionnaires, or requests or inquiries submitted through our Services.

For example, parents provide us with information about children, including the child’s username, password, age and/or date of birth, and gender. Similarly, if a relative wants to be a financial contributor to a child, the parent will also provide us with that relative’s username, password, and bank account or financial information.

## OUR CHOICES

You may update or delete the personal information that we have about you or your child by updating your or their profile on our Site or emailing us at info@busykid.com. Please note that we may retain certain information as required by law or as permitted by law for legitimate business purposes. For example, if you request that we delete your information but we believe that you have violated our Terms of Use we may retain information about you in order to attempt to resolve the issue before deleting it.

We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to parents. Parents may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process opt-out requests. If a parent opts out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest him/her, we may still send that parent emails about his/her account or any Services the parent has requested or received from us.

* * *

## CHILDREN

Our Services are targeted to parents. As discussed in the **Information We Collect** section above, parents provide us directly with most of the personal information we collect about children under the age of 13. The only information we collect directly from children under 13 is automatically collected information, such as IP address and Site or App activities, like chores completed and purchases or payments requested. The personal information we collect about children is not made publicly available or otherwise shared, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

Under COPPA, parents have a right to review the information we have collected about their child, to delete it, and to tell us to no longer use their child’s personal information. Parents can review most of the information we collect about their child by logging in to their account, reviewing their account information, and updating the personal information we maintain about their child – or they can email us at info@busykid.com to request such updates. If a parent does not want us to collect and use their child’s personal information anymore, then s/he may cancel his/her child’s account and use of the Services.

Please note that copies of information that parents update, modify, or delete may remain viewable in cached and archived pages for a period of time.
