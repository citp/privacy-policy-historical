## Privacy Statement

### Updated 9th January 2015

This website is operated and controlled by COSLA on behalf of its member organisations. myjobscotland is the national shared recruitment portal for Scotland's 32 local authorities and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. It advertises job vacancies online through a single internet portal managed by COSLA. The portal allows candidates in any location to view vacancies and submit applications online to the organisation advertising the vacancy. Applicants can register to receive job alerts via email. This policy is designed to inform you of COSLA’s commitment to upholding your right to privacy and how COSLA will handle your personal data when you using myjobscotland.gov.uk

Information you supply will be processed by COSLA in accordance with the requirements and principles of the Data Protection Act 1998. COSLA is registered with the Information Commissioner as a data controller under the following address and registration number: COSLA, Verity House, 19 Haymarket Yards, Edinburgh EH12 5BH - Registration No: Z6216554

Information entered onto the myjobscotland website is stored in a database managed by Lumesse on COSLA’s behalf. The organisation to which you are applying is given limited access to this database, in order to process your application for a vacancy.

Once the closing date has been reached your application information will be made available to the organisation to which you have applied, and they are obligated to handle your data in accordance with their policy.

Links within this website to external websites are not covered by this policy and individuals should check the terms of the privacy policy of those sites for their terms. COSLA is not responsible for the content or policies of external web sites.

## Application Forms and Personal Data

If you choose to apply for a vacancy with one of the organisations featured on the website, the following information will be requested from you and centrally stored and accessible by the recruiting organisation:

  * Contact information e.g. your name, address, email, contact telephone number
  * A description of your work experience, skills and education
  * Responses to specific application questions
  * Details of interview assessments
  * Equal Opportunity monitoring information
  * Any supplementary information you choose to support your application e.g. qualifying documents



This information will be used solely for the purposes of recruitment by the personnel department of that organisation. It will be made clear to you at the point of submitting your application which organisation will have access to your data and by not submitting the application you would be opting out of this recruitment process.

After you have created an account and/or submitted an application your account will be anonymised/archived, by removing personal details such as your name, address, email, contact telephone number, after one year of inactivity in your account.  Accounts cannot be unarchived after this period. Therefore the onus is on you to keep your account active should you wish to continue to access your application information.  Successful candidate information will be retained for seven years.

If you are not offered a job, in accordance with the above paragraph, your application information will remain on your account until it is archived.

COSLA will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may make information available to tax and law enforcement agencies, as required or permitted by law. At any point you can request the removal of your personal data by emailing myjobscotland@cosla.gov.uk with your contact details. You will then be contacted and asked a number of security questions to ensure the validity of your request.
