This policy was modified July 1, 2004 to comply with changes to Chapter 22 (commencing with Section 22575) to Division 8 of the California Business and Professions Code.  
   
We may modify or change our privacy practices from time to time, particularly as new laws and regulations become effective. Any changes will be effective for all the personal and health information that we maintain, even information in existence before the change.
