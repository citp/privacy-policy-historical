##  About myLot Privacy 

This policy explains how myLot treats personal information that myLot collects and receives when an individual becomes a myLot member. Personal information is information that is personally identifiable like your name, birth date, or email address, some of which is publicly displayed. 

This policy applies only to myLot and does not apply to the practices of companies that myLot does not own or control or to people that myLot does not employ or manage. In addition, certain myLot associated companies have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by going to their websites. 

##  General Information 

myLot collects personal information such as your name, email address, country you reside in, and birth date when you register for our services. myLot may also collect other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, and age in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other. Once you register with myLot and sign in to our services, any data you provide, with the exception of your email address, may potentially be displayed to other myLot members and the public as a whole. 

##  Security 

myLot member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. myLot takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. For any additional information about the security measures we use on myLot.com, please contact us with your questions or concerns. 

##  Information Sharing and Disclosing 

User Profile information such as name, username and location is displayed to myLot members in order to facilitate user interaction in the myLot social networking community. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, myLot allows users to search for other members by name, username and country of residence. 

From time to time, myLot or a partner of myLot, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest on myLot.com. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address, home address, and/or answer certain questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. 

myLot is a very public community, and any information you provide in your profile or in a post is publicly viewable. Therefore, it is important that you think carefully before submitting any information on myLot. You will be able to edit or delete your submissions at any time, and cancelling your myLot account will remove all information provided from the website.
