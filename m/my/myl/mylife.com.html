                While Reunion.com Sites each offer a different combination of services and tools from one site to another, this policy states Reunion.com's company-wide Privacy Policy with regard to data-collection practices.  Please refer to our <a href="/user-agreement">User Agreement</a> for the registered members terms of service, which states the terms of use 
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                <span style="color:333399;"><strong>Overview of Our Policy</strong></span><br>
                The security of your personal information is a high priority at Reunion.com.

We advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address ("Personally Identifiable information") within these public areas that they do not wish to share.  This information should instead be maintained in the appropriate email and contact information section of this site, which is protected under the terms of this privacy policy. 
                <br><br>
                <span style="color:333399;"><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></span><br>

                <br><br>
                <span style="color:333399;"><strong>About Children</strong></span><br>
                Children under 13. The Reunion.com Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. The Reunion.com Sites prohibits registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.

                <br><br>
                <span style="color:333399;"><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></span><br>
                Below are more details about the information the Reunion.com Sites gather from you and how we use it.
                <br><br>
                <strong>A. Email Newsletters and Updates.</strong> Reunion.com Sites offer email newsletters and important account activity updates that may be promotional in nature. As part of the Reunion.com service you will receive these updates. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving any of the updates, follow the unsubscribe procedures at the bottom of any newsletter or update we send you, or alternatively, you may change your notification settings by visiting the E-Mail Notification Settings page located in the My Account area of our site. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from any promotionally oriented emails, newsletters, or account activity updates, you may continue to receive transactional email messages from Reunion.com with important information pertaining to your account and our services. 
                <br><br>
                Email a Friend<br> 
                If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Reunion.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  
                <br><br>
                Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reunion.com">support@reunion.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.
                <br><br>
                <strong>B. Membership Registration Information.</strong> When you register for membership on one of our sites, we ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At a minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site, updates, and promotions to your interests. We may engage third parties to perform analysis or data processing of our databases that involves access to this information in order to better provide you with the services for which you joined (in which case we will take measures to ensure that such parties are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it other than in a manner that is necessary to perform their work for Reunion.com). 
                <br><br>
                We may also use or disclose your membership registration or other Personally Identifiable Information as follows: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
					<span class="ProfBodyBlk">
                	<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We also sometimes offer our members other services provided by third parties. When you register for membership on a Reunion.com Site or activate a service by clicking on a particular service link (e.g., email) on our sites, you may be automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of your Personally Identifiable Information may be shared by Reunion.com with those third-party service providers, such as our credit card processing company. We take care to require that our third-party service providers only use our member's data as necessary to provide the particular service requested. These service providers may not use this information for any other purpose, including their own marketing purposes.</li> 
                	<br><br>
					<li><strong>Co-registration with Other Sites.</strong> As a member, we may offer you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In some instances where Reunion.com provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is shared with those organizations. As a result, you may receive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for further information. We are not responsible for the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by any such service provider. In order to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will need to go directly to the partner's site. Examples include special discount savings subscription offers from Web Loyalty and Lift Media.</li> 
                	<br><br>
					<li><strong>Third Party Search Engines.</strong> When you create and submit a public profile to Reunion.com, you authorize Reunion.com to publicly disclose such information, other than Personally Identifiable information, through the Reunion.com website as well as other third party search engines and websites.</li> 
                	<br><br>
					<li><strong>Updates to Personal Information.</strong> When you become a member, other members and third parties may, through use of our 'Reunion.com for Outlook' and other specified services, seek to update their personal contact lists by requesting your personal information, including your Personally Identifiable Information. In some cases, businesses may send us a list of personal information in an attempt to re-contact customers or subscribers whose contact information may have changed. WE WILL NOT PROVIDE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THESE OTHER MEMBERS, BUSINESSES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. We will notify you when any such request for your contact information is made, and you will be provided with the option to accept or decline the request. If you do not respond to this request, you will be considered to have declined the request, and your updated contact information will not be provided.</li> 
                	<br><br>
					<li><strong>Blogs and Forums.</strong>  If you use a blog or forum area on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</li> 
                	<br><br>
					<li><strong>Testimonials.</strong>  We use testimonials on this site.  We receive your permission to post these prior to their appearance on our site.  If you would like your testimonial removed at any time, please contact us by <a href="http://help.reunion.com/">clicking here</a></li>
					</span>
				</ul> 
                <strong>C. When You Purchase a Service from Reunion.com</strong> When you purchase a service from Reunion.com, you will be required to provide us with certain contact information, including your name, email address and billing address. We also require other information necessary to process your payment (such as a credit card and expiration date). We may use the information you provide us to bill you for products and services you have requested, or to notify you of additional products and services available to you. By becoming a member, you agree that we may share this information with our service providers, which may include banks and credit card companies we use to process your transaction.  They are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>D. Email Updates to Members.</strong> The Reunion.com Sites and our partners periodically send service email updates announcing special offers and/or new features to registered users. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving any of the updates, follow the unsubscribe procedures at the bottom of any newsletter or update we or our partner sends to you, or alternatively, you may change your notification settings by visiting the E-Mail Notification Settings page located in the My Account area of our site.
                <br><br>
                <strong>E. Promotions.</strong> We ask you for Personally Identifiable Information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by a third party. If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions of this nature, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties involved in the promotion so they can contact you. They may use that information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others.
                <br><br>
                To opt-out of this sharing of information, please indicate your preference not to receive Special Offers on the E-Mail Notification Settings page located in the My Account area of our site. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>F. Surveys and User Research.</strong> Reunion.com conducts email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to gather information about our audience. It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them. We share only the aggregate results of these surveys, not individual data, with our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their advertising on our service. We also store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the site more useful for you.
                <br><br>
                <strong>G. Use of Cookies.</strong> On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site involves cookies. Cookies help us and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure the aggregate or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the Reunion.com Sites. To find out more about changing your browser to reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies">http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies</a>  
                <br><br>
                Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these Cookies.  See "Third Party Advertising." 
                <br><br>
				<strong>H.  Log Files.</strong>  As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.  
                <br><br>
                We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  
                <br><br>
                We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.  
                <br><br>
                We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate in order to track the volume of visits, usage of certain features, and length of time on site. This information is used to gain insight into customer needs and behavior in order to help us improve the site and services offered, 
                <br><br>
                <strong>I. Sites You Visit.</strong> As you access our Affiliate Sites and browse around the Reunion Sites, Reunion.com may store information about which pages and which Affiliate Sites you visit and other information presented in your browser's URL address line. Reunion.com will use this information to help determine what our users are most interested in.
                <br><br>
                <strong>J. Other Third Parties.</strong> Reunion.com may share non-personal, aggregate, or summary, information regarding our users with other third parties not mentioned in this policy. This kind of information does not identify you individually, but is often used to provide general demographics or statistics.
                <br><br>
                <strong>K. Merger or Acquisition.</strong> In the event of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of substantially all or a portion of our assets (including a website owned by us), you agree that Reunion.com may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale.
                <br><br>
                <strong>L. Legal Authorities.</strong> The Reunion.com Sites may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in cases when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify someone who may be violating Reunion.com's User Agreement or may be causing injury to Reunion.com's rights or property, other users, or anyone else. The Reunion.com Sites may disclose Personally Identifiable Information of our users to government authorities at our discretion.
                <br><br>
                We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
                <br><br>
				<strong>M. Downloadable Software.</strong>  The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.  Please refer to the license agreement displayed at the time of download for the terms applicable to your downloading and use of any such software.
                <br><br>
                <span style="color:333399;"><strong>Access to Other Sites Through Reunion.com</strong></span><br>
                Linking to Other Sites. You may also visit independent web sites, not operated by Reunion.com, that are connected to our network for our users. Such sites are operated by external, third-party service providers. Some of these sites will have their own separate membership processes and privacy policies.

                <span style="color:333399;"><strong>Security</strong></span><br>
                The Reunion.com Sites use diligent efforts to protect the security and integrity of the information you provide to us once it is received on our systems. However, when you submit information about yourself to the Reunion.com Sites over the Internet, the information may travel over many systems that are not under the control of Reunion.com. We take the protection of user data very seriously and to that end provide extra assurances that your information will not be intercepted. In the case of shopping pages, for example, the credit card information you submit is protected by secure servers.
                <br><br>
                When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
                <br><br>
                We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us by <a href="http://help.reunion.com/">clicking here.</a>
