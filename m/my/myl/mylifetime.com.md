#### Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information Generally:

We do not collect personally identifiable information about individuals, e.g., name, street address and zip code, email address, landline and cell phone numbers, gender, birthday and any other information that would allow us to identify you or contact you (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") on this web site except when you specifically and knowingly provide that information to us. That information will only be used by Lifetime in accordance with the policies set forth below. We never collect your social security number or bank information. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information we may collect from you and use: 

  * the e-mail addresses of those who post comments, stories, videos and other content on our web site; 
  * the names and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us by e-mail; 
  * the names and e-mail addresses of those who specifically opt in to special offers;
  * information you provide to us in surveys to Members, in connection with contests or sweepstakes which Lifetime sponsors, and/or in response to solicitations for photographs, ideas, or stories for use on Lifetime Online and/or on air. 
  * information you provide about yourself when you post to our web site. 



Note: You do not have to provide Personally Identifiable Information to us. However, particular services provided through this web site may require that you furnish Personally Identifiable Information, e.g., to become a Member; to enter a Lifetime sweepstakes or contest; to receive one or more of our electronic newsletters; to participate in our online community; and to participate in various promotional opportunities.

#### Cookies:

We may place a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. Cookies allow us to track where you travel on our site and what you look at. They also permit us to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads. If you are a Member, they allow us to customize the content we send to you. Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with an opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie will not interfere with your use of this site, although it is possible some parts of the site will not function properly if you do so. The cookie itself does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information, although it will enable us to relate a visitor's use of our site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to us.

#### Web Beacons:

While you are on the web site, or while you are otherwise viewing the web site content, you may encounter Web beacons, which may come from Lifetime or from third parties, such as advertisers or content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a Web bug or "clear gif," is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, and may allow access to certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. We do not have control over Web beacons used by third parties and do not have access to whatever information they may collect.

#### Links:

This web site contains links to third-party web sites. Lifetime is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on those other web sites. When linking to another web site you should read the privacy policy posted on that web site. Our privacy policy only governs information collected on this web site.

#### Aggregate Information:

We also collect aggregate information (i.e., not personally identifiable to specific users) through our site relating to usage and/or traffic levels on our site, e.g., the total number of users who visit our site and/or a particular page on our site. We also collect and analyze aggregate demographic information. Further, aggregate information is helpful to us for improving the services we offer and for marketing purposes. We may share aggregate information, which does not personally identify you, with our advertisers, business partners or other companies to provide more relevant services and advertising to you.

#### Legally Required Use and/or Disclosure of Information:

Please note that we may also use and/or disclose Personally Identifiable Information without your prior permission or notice if we believe that we are required to do so by law, to comply with legal process or governmental request, to enforce our Terms of Use and other rules and policies, or to protect the right, property or safety of Lifetime, its users or the public.

#### Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers:

We work with third parties who provide services related to this site, e.g., data analysis, emailing, mobile services and other services of similar nature. Personally Identifiable Information, including financial information that you provide to us, necessarily may be shared with such third parties, but only for the purpose of their providing such services.

#### Ad Servers:

We serve up advertisements on our web site through an ad server. As a result of your visit to our site, the ad server company may collect information such as your IP address, and click stream information. We cannot control the activities of such advertisers or web sites. For further information, please consult the privacy policy of [Doubleclick](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

#### Disclosure to Advertisers and Promotional Partners:

If you opt in to receive information about identified advertisers or their services or products, we share your Personally Identifiable Information with them. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are subject to the advertisers' respective privacy policies.

#### No Liability for Third Parties Uses:

While we will seek to require third parties with whom we have agreements and relationships to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.

#### Editorial Uses:

Lifetime may use Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us in response to our solicitation for editorial purposes, online and/or on air and we may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes, as we indicate. In the event such information is used online, on a mobile application, or in a telecast, no Personally Identifiable Information, other than name, city and state, will be disclosed without your specific consent. We may share the information with producers of our programs and/or with others if you have explicitly advised us of your consent to be included in such an exchange.

#### Members:

The Membership section of Lifetime’s web site makes special offers available to those users who sign up and provide Lifetime with certain Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information also may be obtained through surveys we send to Members by email (with their consent) or which are posted in the Members section, and are only used for internal review and/or our own market research and/or to improve the content of our web site. If we provide any such information to third parties, we only provide such information in aggregated form.

Member accounts are secured by Member-created usernames and passwords. Lifetime takes precautions to ensure account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

#### Postings and Profiles:

Only Members can post materials to our web site including, without limitation, comments, stories, photos and videos. While only Members can post these materials, Members and non-members alike can see the postings. You should be careful not to disclose sensitive, personal information on our web site. Any information posted can be accessed by the public and may be used by members of the public to send you unsolicited communications. Your username may be displayed when you post material to this web site; therefore, if you associate your name with your username, people may be able to personally identify you and your activities on this web site. 

#### Chats:

From time to time, we will host chats. The terms governing Postings and Profiles also apply to chats.

#### Newsletters:

If you wish to receive Lifetime electronic newsletter(s), you must be a Member. If you wish to stop receiving a particular newsletter or change your newsletter preferences, please go the Membership section and edit your profile.

#### How to Access, Discontinue Use of and/or Correct or Revise Information We Have About You:

If you are a Member, you can sign in on any page of the web site and edit, correct or delete your profile information (i.e., the Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us). However, we are not in a position at this time to provide you with a copy of information you have provided in response to a market survey, or copies of communications you have sent to our site (e.g., inquiries). If you receive any other email from us, you may request that we stop sending it to you by mailing us at privacy@lifetimetv.com Please note, however, that if you use more than one name or email address when communicating with us or participating on our web site, you may continue to receive communications from us to any name and/or email address which you have not specified in your request.

Please note: We are not responsible for removing information from third party lists or entities with which we have shared your information pursuant to this policy. If you receive e-mails or other communications from third parties for which you have opted in from Lifetime, you will then be subject to that third party's privacy policy.

#### Children:

Our site is a general audience site, and is not intended for children under 13. Further, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we receive information from anyone who we later learn is under the age of 13, we destroy the information.

#### Sale or Assignment of Information:

We reserve the right to transfer, sell or assign Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from you to any entity that purchases all or a portion of our assets, that purchases all or a portion of our assets related to this site, or that otherwise obtains the information in connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation of all or a portion of our business.

#### Contacting Us Generally

If you have any questions about Lifetime generally, please feel free to contact us at: at Viewer Relations, either by email at viewerrelations@lifetimetv.com or by telephone, 212-424-7122.

#### Future Uses of Information and/or Revisions to this Privacy Policy.

From time to time, we may want to use Personally Identifiable information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed. For example:

  * Some of you may sign petitions that we post in connection with Lifetime’s support of legislation affecting various women’s issues; occasionally, we may send you an electronic email update concerning the course of the legislation related to that issue or related issues. 
  * We may send you information concerning Lifetime promotions or initiatives we think you may be interested in. 
  * We may send you information concerning new features on our web site. 



In such cases, we will provide you with the ability to opt out or "unsubscribe" from future similar communications.

#### California Privacy Rights

As of January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing. If you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail to Lifetime at: privacy@lifetimetv.com

We also may amend this privacy policy from time to time. You should check back at this web site periodically and determine if the Privacy Policy has been revised by referring to the "Last Updated" date on this page. We will also notify Members by email if we make changes to the Privacy Policy in a way that alters the type of information that we collect or the way that we use that information.
