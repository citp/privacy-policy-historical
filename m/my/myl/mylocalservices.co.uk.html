		<ul>
          <li>My Local Services is part of Lowi Ltd(Lowi). Lowi will never      share your e-mail address or any personal details supplied with any third      party. Listings placed here using the free advertising option record only      information generally available in the public domain. </li>
          <li>Advertisers who choose to buy an enhanced listing at My Local      Services by doing so agree to have the information submitted displayed on My      Local Services for a period of 12 months. </li>
          <li>My Local Services electronically cloak your e-mail address in      order to avoid internet spam robots spidering your address.</li>
          <li>My Local Services may use your e-mail address to share news or      important information relating to My Local Services. My Local Services undertake      to limit such contact to a maximum of 12 e-mails in any one year. You may      at any time inform us that you do not want to receive any correspondence      from My Local Services by selecting the contact tab and sending us an      email. So that we can verify your request, please be sure to include your      email address in the body of your message.</li>
          <li>Children under 13 years of age are required to present the      expressed permission of their parent or legal guardian prior to disclosing      any personal information or entering a competition.</li>
          <li>My Local Services collects information to identify how people      arrived at the web site, which pages they visited, and how long they      stayed. Using web analysis software My Local Services are able to      ascertain this information. Please note that this report does not identify      any of the user's personal information.</li>
          <li>My Local Services may use cookies to enhance your experience on      our Web site. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your      computer to help personalise your visit to the site. You can disable      cookies by adjusting your settings in your browser. Contact your browsers      help file for more information.</li>
          <li>What is a Cookie? A cookie is a text-only string of information that a      website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's      hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A      cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie      has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a      randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this      website-session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the      cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent      cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer      (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). </li>
          <li>My Local Services reserve the right to change this statement at      any time. We are not responsible for any breach of security or for any      actions of any third parties that receive your personal information.</li>
