**Links and Third Party Advertisers**

Mylocaluniversity.com allows other companies, also referred to as Third Party Advertisers, Ad Servers, or Ad Networks (collectively, the "Advertisers") to serve advertisements via the Website.

For that reason, Mylocaluniversity.com does not knowingly collect or maintain any information via the Website from persons under the age of thirteen (13), and no part of our Website is directed to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If an underage person provides such information and Mylocaluniversity.com has unknowingly collected said information, then Mylocaluniversity.com will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
