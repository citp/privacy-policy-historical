<em>Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using this website. In this Policy "we", "us" and "our" means Myzone (defined below) and "you" means the individual who is using the website. By using our website, you agree with the collection, the use and the disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</em><br><br>

All companies have their registered office at 29/31 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man IM1 1LB, British Isles.</em><br><br>

<em>We collect information from you when you register your Myzone belt on our site. We also collect information from Myzone facilities (health clubs, community hubs, schools or employers etc.).</em><em><br><br>

When registering your Myzone belt on our website you will be asked to enter information including your name, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, height, weight, phone number and member/employee  number (if applicable).In addition you may provide (either through manually inputting data or through the use of compatible devices) biometric data such as blood pressure, bone mass, fat mass, basal metabolic rate, waist circumference, fat free mass, total body water, visceral fat and metabolic age.<br><br>

If you have installed a Myzone application on a mobile phone device you may also capture images to record food consumption and, for users aged 18 or over, body shape.
<br><br>

Myzone facilities will be asked to provide their contact details including their telephone number, email address and Twitter account.<br><br>

We also collect information passively from the Myzone belt, including heart rate data.</em><br><br>

<u><strong>What do we use your information for?</strong></u><br><br>

<em>The primary reason for requesting information is to personalise your experience and allow you to enjoy the full benefits of being able to monitor your physical activity through measuring, recording and displaying your heart rate while using the Myzone belt. The information we collect from you may also be used in the following ways:<br><br>
 
• To improve our website(we continually strive to improve our website based on the information and feedback we receive from you)<br>
• To improve customer service(your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)<br>
• To administer a contest, promotion, survey or similar function.  Note: you can unsubscribe from receiving marketing communications by contacting us in writing.<br>
• To send periodic emails. The email address you provide will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your Myzone belt or matters which are believed may be of interest.<br> 
• We request information from Myzone facilities so that they can register as a Myzone site owner, access the names of those that have registered belts at their facility, so they can communicate with them, and to enhance belt users’ experience of the Myzone system.<br>
</em><br>
  
<u><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></u><br><br>

<em>Myzone Limited is registered as a data controller in the Isle of Man under the Data Protection Act 2002 and has Notification Number N002814. Accordingly, information which is held must be: <br><br>

• Used fairly and lawfully <br>
• Used for specific and lawful purposes, in a manner that is compatible with those purposes <br>
• Adequate, relevant and not excessive <br>
• Accurate and where necessary kept up to date <br>
• Kept for no longer than necessary <br>
• Used in accordance with the rights of individuals under the Act <br>
• Kept secure to avoid unauthorised or unlawful use, accidental loss, or damage<br><br>

Advice and a copy of the Register are available from the Office of the Data Protection Controller www.gov.im/odps.<br><br>

The Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 has been drafted to meet the standards set out in the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and is similar to the UK's Data Protection Act 1998.
On the 28th April 2004, the European Commission formally recognised that the legislation provides an adequate level of protection.</em><br><br>

<u><strong>Do we use cookies? </strong></u><br><br>

<em>Yes (Cookies are small files that a site transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).<br><br>

We use cookies to help us remember and process site preferences so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We do not share cookies with third parties.</em><br><br>

<u><strong>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</strong></u><br><br>
 
<em>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information except in the following situations:<br><br>
<u>Subcontractors.</u> From time to time we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services.  These services include, among other things, assisting us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you.  We require our subcontractors to agree to keep the personal information that they receive confidential. <br>
<br>
<u>Your Facilities.</u>  If you register or use your Myzone belt at a facility (health club, community hub, school or employer etc.), your information may be accessed by individuals engaged by those facilities (for example, so that they can deliver a service to you) and you expressly consent to your personal information being used in this manner. It must be noted that such individuals are not our employees or agents (except  to the extent that they may collect in some situations consent to our privacy policies on our behalf) and you should satisfy yourself that the facility has procedures in place to protect your privacy (and, if applicable, the privacy of any child – see ‘Children’s Online Privacy’, below).To enable users to enjoy the Myzone experience it is mandatory and unavoidable for facilities to have access to personal information including the name, email address, gender, date of birth, belt ID, and maximum and resting heart rates of belt users. Facilities can also access data showing when belt users have participated in any class activity, the duration of such activity, and the amount of calories burnt. The facilities do not have access to any personal biometric data unless you permit them to have such access.</em><br><br>

<em><u>Business Transition.</u> In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, your information will be transferred to the acquiring company. <br>
<br>
<u>Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement.</u>  We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity.

<u>Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law.</u>  We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law.  This may include sharing your information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.<br><br>

You may Choose to Share your Information. You may choose to grant permission to 1) your facility so that they can view your biometric data and 2) your friends and trainers etc. by reference to their email address so that they can view one or more of your activities, food diary, biometrics and (provided you are aged 18 or over) body images.<br><br>

Notwithstanding the above, we may provide anonymised (non-personally identifiable) information to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</em><br>
<br>
<u><strong>Children’s Online Privacy</strong></u><br>
<br>
<em>We are mindful that the belt and system will be attractive and of benefit to users under the age of 13 and it is our policy, regardless of the country in which the facility is located, to ensure that parents or teachers (if they are authorised and it is legal for them to do so) can monitor data collected in respect of such persons. We try to achieve this through adopting an approach which is compliant with the United States legislation known as the <u>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</u> (‘COPPA’).<br>
<br>
Our website, products and services are all available to persons who are below 13 years of age.  A parent or teacher(as advised to us) of any child who has not attained 13 years of age can review their child's/student’s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information. If the parent or teacher wishes to exercise this right they should contact us in writing using the information below. We only collect personal information that is required to provide the service: <strong>please note that the removal of such personal information will render the belt and service inoperable.</strong><br>
<br>
The parent or teacher of any person aged below 13 years is required to consent to the collection and use of their child's or student’s personal information at the time of registering a belt. Parents and teachers must communicate this consent through completion of a consent form which is available through us or our distributors. These consent forms must be verified as follows:(1) in the case of a parent, a Parental Consent Form in respect of the child must be completed and then verified by the facility in which the belt is registered;  or (2) in the case of a teacher, an  Educational Institution Consent Form must be completed and verified, through the education facility where the belt is registered,  by providing in respect of that teacher, a Union Card, State Issued Teaching Certificate, Home Schooling Certificate, State Issued Preschool/Daycare Facility Certificate/License, Home Schooler Affidavit or IHIP Approval Letter from School District or State.<br>
<br>
Parents and teachers (as applicable) will receive a copy of all email communications that are sent to their child or student, until such child or student has attained the age of 13. This will enable them to monitor data in respect of such children and/or students.</em><br>
<br>
