**Privacy Policy  
Effective: May 12, 2009**

Welcome to the web site (the “ **Site** ”) of Zeo, Inc. (“ **Zeo** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” and/or “ **our** ”). Through the Site, including without limitation the corporate-branded area and the area of the Site made available to registered owners of the Zeo Personal Sleep Coach (the “ **MyZeo Coach** ”), you will have access to an educational tool and motivational program that helps you learn about your sleep and which habits and behaviors may be keeping you from enjoying the sleep that you need (collectively, the “ **Zeo Services** ”). The Zeo Services are neither a medical device nor a medical program and are not intended for the diagnosis and/or treatment of sleep disorders.

Your privacy is very important to us at Zeo. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our policy with respect to personally identifiable data (“ **Personal Data** ”) and other information that is collected from those who use our Site.
