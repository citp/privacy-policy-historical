<p><strong>About  cookies</strong></p>
<p> A  cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and  numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by  the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time  the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
<p>Cookies  can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they  navigate different pages on a website and to identify users returning  to a website. </p>
<p>Cookies may  be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies.  A  persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a  web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain  valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before  the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at  the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies  on this website</strong></p>
<p>We use both  session cookies and persistent cookies on this website.</p>
<p><strong>How we  use cookies</strong> </p>
