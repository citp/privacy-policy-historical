        <br>
        <br>
        This Privacy Statement sets forth the information gathering, use, and dissemination practices of My Life Registry LLC ("MyRegistry") in connection with the World Wide Web site located at <span id="privacysite">www.myregistry.com</span> (the “Site”). This Privacy Statement addresses MyRegistry’s practices regarding information collected only directly through or from the Site - it does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected other than directly through or from the Site, including, without limitation, from or via telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other offline means or media. MyRegistry can be contacted by mail at P.O. Box 1646 Fort Lee, NJ 07024, or by e-mail at customercare@myregistry.com. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span id="section1" class="Section">INFORMATION COLLECTION</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        MyRegistry collects and may track (1) the e-mail addresses of member visitors that communicate with MyRegistry via e-mail, (2) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, order forms, surveys, e-mail, the “Contact Us” section of the Site, other inquiries visitors may make through the Site, and other online avenues (including, but not limited to, information such as demographic, business profile, and personal profile data), (3) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of member visitors to the Site, and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site member visitors access.  
        MyRegistry places Internet “cookies” on member visitors’ hard drives to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Site. Internet cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive to enable our system to recognize your browser. Internet cookies save data about individual member visitors, such as the member visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the member visitor. Internet cookies enable MyRegistry to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users. Our cookies do have an expiration date. The “help” portion of your toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 
        MyRegistry also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to member visits to and activity on the Site. A Web “bug” is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.
        When a member visitor performs a search within the Site, MyRegistry may record information identifying the member visitor or linking the member visitor to the search performed. MyRegistry may also record limited information for every member visit and search request, for example, in the form of a Web or Site log, and use that information to provide member visitors with a better experience while visiting our Site, to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span id="Label1" class="Section">USE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Personal data collected by MyRegistry may be used by MyRegistry for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes; to improve your shopping experience; to communicate with you about products, promotions, services, and contests; to maintain your account; for administration and review of the Site content; for product development; for content improvement; for fulfillment of a requested transaction or recordkeeping; for marketing and promotional purposes; for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior; or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data regarding member visitors’ home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to MyRegistry may be added to MyRegistry’s databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events. 
        MyRegistry also may use member visitor data to contact the member visitors regarding account status and changes to the Web Site Terms and Conditions, Online Agreement, Privacy Statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to member visitors.  Additionally, MyRegistry may send members electronic mail regarding billing, administrative, or legal matters relating to the Site or services available or provided via the Site or notifying you of special offers or promotions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span id="Label2" class="Section">DISCLOSURE OF DATA TO THIRD PARTIES</span>        
        <br>
        <br>
        We may disclose information you provide to us to third parties in order to complete a transaction that you requested, for example, product fulfillment companies, credit card processing companies and banks. Please note that we may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with the law or legal process. 
        MyRegistry also may disclose information about member visitors’ Site usage and demographics to third parties on an aggregate basis. 
        Aggregate data regarding member visitors’ home servers and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers, may be disclosed or distributed: to another party with which MyRegistry enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase; or to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process; in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process; or if determined by MyRegistry in its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health, or property of MyRegistry or any other person or entity.
        MyRegistry is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, the conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices of any third party. 
        This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or advertisements for or placed by third parties. MyRegistry has no control over Web sites that we provide links to, and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements. It is possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about Site visitors. It is solely the visitors’ obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web sites and of these advertisers and third parties.

        <br>
                 
        <span id="Label5" class="Section">SECURITY MEASURES</span>           
        <br>
        <br>
        MyRegistry has implemented security features that are designed to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For example, all information personally identifying to our visitors is stored on a highly secure server, and all credit card information is stored in a clear format. 
        Once we receive personally-identifiable information, we take steps to protect its security on our systems. In the event we request or transmit sensitive information, such as credit card information, we use industry standard, secure socket layer (“SSL”) encryption.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <span id="Label6" class="Section">OPT-OUT RIGHT</span>          
        <br>
        <br>
        Except as necessary for MyRegistry to provide the services, information, or products requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having his or her personally identifiable information, which has been voluntarily provided to MyRegistry through an account registration, customer order, or other account activity, prospectively retained by MyRegistry, prospectively used by MyRegistry for secondary purposes, or prospectively disclosed by MyRegistry to third parties by contacting MyRegistry via postal mail or e-mail at the addresses set out above. (This does not apply to collection of the type of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to information provided or collected that does not meet the description in this Section.)

        <br>
        <br>
        <span id="Label7" class="Section">ACCESS TO AND ABILITY TO CORRECT PERSONAL DATA</span>                 
        <br>
        <br>
        Upon a visitor’s request via the Site, postal mail or e-mail, MyRegistry will provide to the visitor a summary of any personally identifiable information retained by MyRegistry regarding the visitor, which information has been voluntarily provided by a visitor to MyRegistry through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription. A visitor may modify, correct, change or update their personally identifiable information by contacting MyRegistry via the Site, postal mail or e-mail at the addresses or numbers above.

        <span id="Label8" class="Section">CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        We may revise this online privacy policy at any time. Notice of any new or revised Privacy Statement, as well as the location of the new or revised statement, will be posted on the Site for at least 60 days after the change. It is the obligation of users returning to the Site to learn of changes to the Privacy Statement since their last visit. Any change to this Privacy Statement shall be effective as to any visitor who has visited the Site before the change was made.
