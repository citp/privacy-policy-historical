                        <p>
                            User Generated Content (UGC) is any content that is made publicly available by users of a system. 
                            The systems most commonly used for posting UGC are social media websites, such as Facebook, Twitter, 
                            Instagram, etc. If you decide to post anything on a social media platform accompanied with the hashtag #ShareMyRegistry, 
                            you are thereby granting MyRegistry.com permission to copy, display, distribute, perform, publish, modify, and/or
                            translate such media in any form, as long as we act in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant laws
                            regarding data privacy. We may also request permission to use UGC that is not accompanied with the #ShareMyRegistry
                            hashtag, if we believe it could serve a legitimate business purpose. If permission is granted, you will be affording 
                            us the same rights to the content as if you had originally posted it with our hashtag. Generally, we will use UGC for 
                            advertising and marketing purposes. We will not attempt to claim ownership to any of the UGC we use, but it must be 
                            understood that we will also never compensate anyone for usage of their publicly accessible data. This right to use
                            your UGC never expires, and we may also encourage third parties to use or archive such content as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to the fact that UGC is available to the public, please be very attentive to the information you post on any social media platform.
                            Any post that is discriminatory based on race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or a mental or physical disability is

                   MyRegistry.com expects all partners and any third parties we conduct business with to comply with relevant data protection and 
                    privacy laws at all times. We take every commercially reasonable step to ensure consistent compliance on our end. 
                    Transparency is becoming more of a focus for lawmakers when drafting new data privacy laws, so we have made it a priority 
                    to ensure all users of our site have the ability to find out how their data is being used, for what purpose, and for how long.
                    We expect the same from all of our partners and any third parties, and will do our best to ensure that we do not conduct business 
                    with any individual person or entity that is not compliant with all relevant laws. If any user wishes to receive 
                    information pertaining to the use or collection of their personal data at any time, we expect all of our partners to be able to 
                    provide that information as necessary. If there is a breach of contract due to the failure of a third party to produce information, 
                    an injunction may be sought against that third party to suspend their business operations until they become compliant, and monetary
                    damages may be sought for the actual breach.

                    <u>Right to Erasure</u>
                </h2>
                <p>All users of MyRegistry.com have the right to request that any and all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) associated with their account be erased. Once a data subject access request (DSAR) is filed and customer identity is verified, the Company must respond to and fulfill such request within 30 days. When an account is “erased,” all PII associated with the account will be permanently deleted, leaving the existence of an anonymous account solely for the purpose of maintaining proper transactional records. The right to erasure strictly pertains to PII, and it must be explicitly understood that transactional history will not be deleted from the Company’s records for any reason. The right to erasure exists to protect users of websites from having their PII stored, transferred, or otherwise utilized by another entity in any manner without proper consent. It will not extend so far as to limit the financial responsibilities and legal obligations that MyRegistry.com has to its customers, employees, partners, and the authorities.</p>
                
                <h2 class="forms_header">
                    <u>Third-Party Partners</u>
                </h2>
                <p>When MyRegistry.com members sign up through one of our software partners, we begin sharing customer data with that partner. While we are directly responsible for our handling of your information, users must be aware that our partners also store customer information for their own business purposes. Therefore, when a member desires to invoke their right to erasure, the member must send deletion requests to any partner websites they signed up through as well as to MyRegistry.com to have the totality of their data erased.</p>
                <p>Members or guests of MyRegistry.com who elect to have their PII deleted from our system may do so by contacting <a href="mailto:GDPRCompliance@myregistry.com" class="forms_link">GDPRCompliance@myregistry.com</a>. </p>

                <p>All users of MyRegistry.com have the undeniable right to ask about and obtain a complete and accurate report on the data being stored about them. If you would like to request a report on the data we are storing about you, email us at <a href="mailto:GDPRCompliance@myregistry.com" class="forms_link">GDPRCompliance@myregistry.com</a>.</p>

                    <u>Transmitting PII + Responding to DSARs</u>
                </h2>
                <p>It is against our policy to send PII without proper safeguards. When a user requests a report on the data being stored about them, certain guidelines must be followed:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>A DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) must be sent by the user whose information is being requested to <a href="mailto:GDPRCompliance@myregistry.com" class="forms_link">GDPRCompliance@myregistry.com</a>.</li>
                    <li>The user’s identity must be verified by the submission of a photo ID that clearly shows the user’s legal name. (This is so we can match the name on the photo ID with the name on the MyRegistry.com account.)</li>
                    <li>MyRegistry.com will send the user an encrypted, password-protected email containing the PII requested.</li>
                    <li>MyRegistry.com will send the user a separate email containing the password that unlocks the encrypted PII in the email.</li>
                </ol>

                    our website. This information may unwittingly reveal your sexual orientation to website visitors. 
                    If you wish to limit access to this information, you have the option to password-protect your account so that 
                    only individuals with your password will be able to view your wedding registry. You can find this option under
