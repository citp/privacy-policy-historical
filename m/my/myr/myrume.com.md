# Privacy Policy – MyRuMe.com

**SECURE ORDERING**

The security of the information regarding your order is very important to us. We use the 256-bit Secure Socket Layer protocol combined with credit card number encryption, to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than RuMe Bags.

Once you reach the buy page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:

  * The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https"
  * Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section for the browser window.



Only browsers that use the 256-bit Secure Socket Layer protocol are able to order through the RuMe website. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page.

**Log Files**  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

We use a third-party tracking service, Google Analytics, that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. This information is used to measure the success of our advertising.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

We set a persistent cookie to link your shopping cart to you. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but you will not be able to place or review orders on the Site. Please [contact us](https://www.myrume.com/pages/contact-us "Contact Us") at 866-921-0475 to place an order.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by MyRume.com

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**  
If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct or update it by making the change on our [My Account](https://www.myrume.com/account/login "Account") pages or by emailing our Customer Support at [info@MyRume.com](mailto:info@myrume.com "info@myrume.com") or by [contacting us](https://www.myrume.com/pages/contact-us "Contact Us") at (303) 799-4256 or RuMe, Inc., Privacy Department, 6981 S. Quentin St, Suite D, Centennial, CO 80112.

**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Business Transitions**  
In the event RuMe, Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. The buyer of RuMe’s assets will be obligated to use your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless they receive consent from you to use it in a different way.  RuMe will not sell its customer information separately from a change of ownership or control of its business or a particular business unit to which the information relates.  You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**  
By using our Web site or purchasing a product from us, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
