We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems by storing User data on a secured in-house database wholly separated from any User-accessible directories. Please note that We have no access to Your credit card data as such information is collected by a third party billing agent. We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals We are unable to guarantee that Our security is one hundred percent (100%) breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.
