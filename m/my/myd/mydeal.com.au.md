There are two main ways we collect information about you:

**If you are not or do not login as a MyDeal Member**

Whenever you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information about your usage of the Site, such as the time of your visit, its duration and the pages you visit.

If you have not identified yourself on the Site, such as by registering for Membership or logging in as a Member, the information we collect about you remains anonymous. 

**If you login as a MyDeal Member**

When you first register for membership, we collect information from you such as your email, name, suburb, and will continue to add to your member profile as you interact more on the Site, for example, if you enter a competition.   
Once you have become a registered member, we collect personal information about you in order to provide you with the full benefits of Membership. It will also enable MYDEAL to bill you and contact you, where necessary, concerning your use of the MYDEAL Site. MYDEAL will also use and analyse the information it collects so that it can administer, support, improve and develop our business.   
In  particular, MYDEAL may contact you for your views on the Site and also to notify you about changes or developments to the Site and services. If you have consented, we may also use your information in order to advise you about other products and services which we offer.

Where MYDEAL does make information or data available to certain authorised agents of MYDEAL, it will do so only in connection with the operation of the Site and MYDEAL will ensure that they apply the MYDEAL Pricacy Policy or in applicable statutory or common law requirement.
