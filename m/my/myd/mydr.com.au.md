## The information practices of _myDr_

### 1\. Collecting information about you

Some services provided by __myDr__ require your email address and may involve disclosing some personal information about yourself. This is to allow us to respond to a query or provide you with information that you have requested. You will also have the option to provide other personal information voluntarily. 

__myDr__ may also collect information about your use of our website such as what pages you visit and the Internet address you have come from. By having this information we can tailor your experience of our website to your personal interests. 

Any further collection of your personal information than that explained here will only occur with your consent. 

### 2\. Using your personal information

Any information collected by _myDr_ will be treated as confidential. We may use your personal information in providing you with information or services you request, and in tailoring your experience of our site to your interests. With your consent, we will send you updates on new features, products and content that we think you are likely to be interested in. 

_myDr_ may also use pooled information obtained from all _myDr_ visitors to understand our users' interests and improve our services. These reports may be shared with the partners and sponsors of _myDr_ but they will not disclose personally identifiable information. 

### 3\. Disclosure

_myDr_ will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information, except when it has your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure or where we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested.

Like many businesses, _myDr_ uses a range of service providers to help us maximise the quality and efficiency of our services and our business operations. This means that individuals and organisations outside of _myDr_ , such as Web hosting services, will sometimes have access to personal information held by _myDr_ and may use it on behalf of _myDr_. We require our service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it for any unauthorised purposes. One example of our service providers is AMPCo, which provides an updated database of medical doctors to _myDr_. This information is managed by AMPCo and obtained by _myDr_ on the basis that the doctors have given consent to the disclosure of their professional details on the _myDr_ web site.

### 4\. You can access and change the information we keep about you

If at any time you want to know exactly what personal information we hold about you, you are welcome to access your record by emailing us at admin@ _myDr_.com.au. We will, except in special circumstances, make our file of your personal information available to you.
