This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ALL METABOLIFE.COM VISITORS  
As a visitor to Metabolife's web site, you are anonymous to the company. Like many other commercial web sites, Metabolife may use a standard technology called a "cookie" that measures the number of visitors to the different sections of the web site. Cookies are designed, generally, to collect and store the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (e.g., aol.com, if you are connecting from an American Online account), the date and time you access Metabolife's site, and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to Metabolife's site. Metabolife uses the information collected by cookies to improve its site and make it more useful to visitors. Metabolife's cookies do not collect personal information. 

INFORMATION ABOUT YOU  
Sometimes Metabolife may ask you to provide specific information when you order a product online, enter a sweepstakes or otherwise contact us. In this case, Metabolife needs the information, such as name, internet and/or e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., in order to respond to your request or contact you. When obtaining information from you, Metabolife will ask only for the information we need to provide the product or information you have requested.  While Metabolife may use customer information to improve our site, or for other internal purposes, you may rest assured that Metabolife will never misuse the information you provide. 

DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
Metabolife does not sell or otherwise share any customer information with marketers outside Metabolife who may want to offer you their own products and services. However, Metabolife may give such information to other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing information on our customer lists, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. In those situations, the outside party is performing work for Metabolife, and Metabolife takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your information is used only to provide the services requested by Metabolife, and not for other purposes.  Metabolife may also disclose your personal information when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our rights or with your prior consent. 

Metabolife recognizes that certain information that you provide to Metabolife through the web site or by other means may be of a particularly sensitive nature.  With regard to such confidential information, Metabolife respects the privacy rights of its customers.  Metabolife will not share such information with anyone outside Metabolife unless compelled by law to do so, and in the event of such compulsion, Metabolife will undertake its best efforts to limit disclosure to the extent permitted by law.
