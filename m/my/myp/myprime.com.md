**Sharing of Information:**

_Non-Personal Information._ Because non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. For example, we may share non-personal information with our affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents, other businesses, and the government.

_Personal Information._ We will only share your personal information with third-parties as outlined in this Website Privacy Policy (in its current or future form) and as otherwise permitted by law.

We share and give access to personal information to our employees and agents (including employees and agents or our affiliates) in the course of operating our businesses. For example, if you sent us an e-mail asking a question, we would provide your e-mail address to one of our employees or agents, along with your question, in order for that person to reply to your e-mail. We may share personal information with other divisions within Prime and with our affiliate entities to ensure that we have the most up to date contact information across these entities and to coordinate the services and benefits you receive from us.

We share personal information with your health plan, your health care providers, and your pharmacies/pharmacists to coordinate your care and, as necessary, to arrange payment for services and benefits you have received. We may also share personal information with appropriate government agencies as required by law.

We may share and give access to personal information with vendors we hire to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a vendor to help us send and manage e-mail. Similarly, we may hire vendors to operate some of our websites.

If we share or give access to personal information to vendors we require them to use the personal information only for limited purposes, such as for sending you the e-mail in the example above.  
If you believe we or any company associated with Prime has misused or improperly disclosed or lost any of your information please contact us immediately and report such matter using the contact information provided below.

We may share personal information with a successor if all or part of our business is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction, or in the event of a corporate reorganization.

We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting website visitors who violate our rules, or engage in behavior that is harmful to other visitors, or is illegal.
