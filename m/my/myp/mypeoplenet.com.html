		<span class="header"><font size="+1">Cignify.com Web Site Privacy Statement</font> </span><br><br>

		<p>Cignify believes that privacy is important to the success and use
		of the Internet. &nbsp;This statement applies to <b>Cignify.com</b> and
		all other sites owned by Cignify (the "Sites") and describes the practices
		Cignify will follow with respect to the privacy of users, including Cignify's
		clients and employees, and including all information that is transmitted through
		the MyPeoplenet portion of this site ("MyPeopleNet"). &nbsp;Cignify may change
		this Privacy Statement from time to time. &nbsp;Any users that provide their current
		e-mail address to Cignify through the Sites will be given notice regarding any
		material changes made to this Statement. &nbsp;If a user has not provided current e-mail
		contact information to Cignify through one of the Sites, such user should check this
		Statement periodically for any changes.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">What is personally identifiable
		information?</p>

		<p>"Personally identifiable information" is information that could
		reasonably be expected to be used to determine the indentity of a user,
		a client or a clients' employee, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses,
		user ID's, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">How is personally identifiable information collected, used,
		and disclosed?</p>

		<p>It is important to distinguish between information provided by users via the Sites
		information that is available about Cignify's clients, or Cignify's clients' employees
		through MyPeopleNet (wether such information was provided through a Site or through
		some other medium).</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">Collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable
		information on the Sites.</p>

		<p>Cignify does not collect personally identifiable information from the Sites without
		asking for it.&nbsp;  Cignify may request that users voluntarily supply information, including
		e-mail addresses, street addresses, telephone numbers, or other information to enhance
		the user's visit to the Site or to follow up after a user's visit. &nbsp;Whether or not such
		information is provided is entirely up to the user.</p>

		<p>A user's voluntary provision of personally identifiable information serves as consent to
		the collection and use of such information as described in the relevant parts of this Privacy
		Statement. &nbsp; In some circumstances, Cignify may share information  it collects from the Sites
		with its trusted business partners. &nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement,
		Cignify does not sell or rent personally identifiable information collected through the Sites
		to any third parties. &nbsp; Cignify may provide aggregate statistics about users of the Sites,
		such as volume, traffic patterns, and related information to reputable third-party vendors,
		but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information. &nbsp; Cignify may also
		disclose personally identifiable information in special cases when it has a good faith belief
		that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with a legal process,
		(b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) enforce the Web Site Terms and Conditions of
		Use, or (d) protect the interests of users or others.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">Collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable
		information at MyPeopleNet.</p>

		<p>Personally identifiable information that is available about a specific individual who is
		employed by or similarly affiliated with a client of Cignify may be available at MyPeopleNet
		either because it was entered through the Sites or some other medium (e.g., by loading batch
		files to the network) for hosting by Cignify. &nbsp; Such information is generally governed by the
		terms of a separate written agreement between the parties, and in the event of a conflict
		between such agreement and this Statement, the written agreement shall control. &nbsp; Cignify
		may use such information only to fulfill its obligations under the written agreement. &nbsp; Cignify
		offers password protection to its clients for use when discussing personally identifiable
		information on Cignify's 1-800 line and for MyPeopleNet at no additional charge. &nbsp; Clients
		shall, in their sole discretion, elect to use or not to use such password protection. &nbsp; Clients
		that elect not to use password protection waive any and all rights the client might otherwise
		have relating to a breach of security that occurred in whole in part, directly or indirectly,
		because of the Client's failure to use password protection.</p>

		<p><b>What are cookies and how are they used?</b></p>

		<p>The Sites, like other commercial web sites, may utilize a standard technology called "cookies"
		to collect information about how the Sites are used. &nbsp; Cookies are small strings of text that
		web sites can send to a web browser. &nbsp; Cookies were designed to help a web site operator determine
		that a particular user had visited the site previously and to save and remember any preferences
		that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. &nbsp; Cookies cannot retrieve any other
		data from a hard drive or obtain an e-mail address. &nbsp; If a user is simply browsing the Site(s), a
		cookie may be used to identify the user as one that has visited the Site(s) before.</p>

		<p>Cignify may also make use of memory-based cookies to authenticate the user of certain Cignify web
		applications (for example, MyPeopleNet). &nbsp;Similarly, if a user is a registered user of a Site that provides
		services to Cignify clients (and has a user ID and password), Cignify may use cookies so that it can provide
		personalized information based on indicated preferences. &nbsp; Although a user has the ability to modify
		most browsers to either accept all cookies, notify the user when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies,
		it may not be possible to utilize those Cignify services which require registration if cookies are rejected.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">What are your choices regarding
		collection, use, and distribution of your information?</p>

		<p>If a user has voluntarily provided information at the Site(s) (not including provision of information in
		MyPeopleNet), the user has consented to the collection and use of its personally identifiable information as
		described in this Privacy Statement. &nbsp; If, in connection with a user's use of a particular service, Cignify
		asks to use data in a way not described in this Privacy Statement and a user does not wish to permit that use,
		the user can choose not to use the particular service.</p>

		<p>If a user has voluntarily provided personally identifiable information at the Site(s) (not including provision
		of information in MyPeopleNet), Cignify may, from time to time, send mail or e-mail regarding products and
		services.  &nbsp;If a user does not want to receive such offers and mailings, that choice can be made by checking
		the appropriate box on the submission form.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">How can you correct, access, and
		update your information?</p>

		<p>A user may view and edit its personally identifiable information
		at any time by contacting us using the link provided on the Site.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">How do we protect your personally identifiable
		information?</p>

		<p>Cignify uses reasonable measures, consistent with those that are standard in Cignify's industry,  to protect
		personally identifiable information from access by unauthorized persons. &nbsp; This includes, among other things,
		standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, and site monitoring. &nbsp; Cignify also uses
		reasonable internal controls, consistent with those that are standard in Cignify's industry, to protect personally
		identifiable information from misuse by Cignify's employees. &nbsp; Unfortunately, no electronic data or transmission
		can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. &nbsp; As a result, while Cignify uses reasonable measures to protect personally
		identifiable information, it cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted or otherwise
		provided to it or received from it. &nbsp; This is especially true for information that is transmitted via e-mail that
		is unprotected until it reaches Cignify's servers. &nbsp; Once a transmission is received, Cignify uses the reasonable
		measures set forth above to secure its servers.</p>


		<p>Internally, Cignify restricts access to personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the
		information in order to do their jobs.  &nbsp;These employees are limited in number and are instructed to adhere to Cignify's
		privacy policies.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">How can you help protect your
		information?</p>

		<p>If a user is using a Site for which it registered and chose a password, Cignify recommends that the password not be
		divulged to anyone, except employees who have a need to know the password for the performance of their duties.  &nbsp;Cignify
		will never ask for a password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. &nbsp; Also, it is important that
		users sign off of the Site(s) and close their browser window when finished using the Site(s).  &nbsp;This is to ensure that
		third parties cannot access personal information and correspondence if they have access to the relevant computer.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">Other sites</p>

		<p>The Site(s) may contain links to other sites, including those of Cignify's business partners. &nbsp; While Cignify
		seeks to link only to sites that share its standards and respect for privacy, it is not responsible for the
		privacy practices employed by other sites. &nbsp;Users are encouraged to review the privacy policy of any site linked
		to from the Site.</p>

		<p style="font-weight: bold">Transfer of Business Assets</p>

		<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may be acquired, merge with another business, or acquire or buy other
		businesses or assets. &nbsp; In such transactions, user and client information, including information about clients'
		employees, generally are among the transferred business assets. &nbsp; In such an event, both personally and non-personally
		identifiable Information will be one of the transferred assets.</p>

		<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement,
		you should contact Matthew Tallman at
