B. What is Personal Information?

Personal Information, when referred to, is information that a user states that personally identifies oneself by one's own name, email, address, phone numbers, and other information that is not publicly available.

The information provided in the Online Marketplace represents neither an invitation to place an ad nor an offer nor a recommendation to rent and/or purchase an item, unless the Provider expressly identifies it unmistakably as an "offer" or "invitation to buy or sell". In case of doubt the user must assume that the Provider does not wish to enter into a binding agreement. The Provider is not a party to a contract that may be formed between the user and a third party publishing information in the Online Marketplace.

All information collected is dependent on the context of which it was collected and how the user utilizes the website. MyProperty.ph collects but is not limited to the following information when registering:

  * **Name**

When a user chooses to place their personal information when creating listings they are doing so under the assumption that the contact phone number they choose will be publicly seen on the listing along with their name.

We encourage our users to practice their own discretion when giving information and to not share their password. Once registered, you and your personal information are on the MyProperty.ph database.
