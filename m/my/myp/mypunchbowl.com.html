<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>Like most websites, <em>Punchbowl Software</em> uses "cookies" to allow you to bypass the login screen ("Remember Me" functionality). A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows <em>Punchbowl Software</em> to recognize you as a member when you return to <strong>MyPunchbowl</strong> from the same computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register with <strong>MyPunchbowl</strong>, a cookie helps <em>Punchbowl Software</em> to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the <strong>MyPunchbowl</strong>, the information you previously provided can be retrieved. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.

<h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

<p><em>Punchbowl Software</em> secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. <em>Punchbowl Software</em> secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><em>Punchbowl Software</em> will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. The effective date will be posted at the top of this agreement if any changes are made to the agreement.</p>
