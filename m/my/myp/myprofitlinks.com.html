General Privacy Policies<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We respect your interest in your privacy and as a result we have created this informational disclosure. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We collect and use personal information for many purposes, including
but not limited to, billing; product and service fulfillment; to better
understand our customer needs; to provide a better website, products
and services; to communicate with customers and potential customers
regarding our products and services and third party products and
services. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Generally, your private information will only be disclosed to our
owners, employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, partners,
affiliates, attorneys, consultants, business associates, service
providers, suppliers and agents, acting on our behalf or request. This
general rule, and disclosures in specific situations, is more
particularly described below. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
You must be at least 18 years old to access this website. We do not
direct this website to persons under 18, nor do we knowingly collect
any personal information from children under the age of thirteen.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Information Collected by our ISP<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
The hosting provider for this Internet site (as with any Internet site)
has the ability to record various information, including domain name,
pages accessed, date and time of access, web browser type and computer
operating system, and referring information, and to disclose this
information. This is most commonly done by providing access to raw
server logs. For more information you should perform an Internet search
on 'server logs' or 'raw server logs.' We may have access to our raw
server logs and access reports prepared by our hosting provider. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Financial Information for Billing Purposes<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We sell products and services. When sales are made financial
information must be disclosed. This information can include any number
of facts you are asked to provide, but most commonly includes your
name, financial / credit card information, billing address, and email
address. Generally, this purchase information will be provided by you
to a third party payment processor and we do not receive your financial
/ credit card information. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
In the event we do receive financial / credit card information, we will
not disclose it to anyone unless disclosure is required by law or a
court order, or unless disclosure is required to address an issue
implicated by the financial transaction.  If you claim that your
financial information was used to make a purchase you did not
authorize, details about the financial transaction may be disclosed to
law enforcement and anyone else we deem necessary to address the
matter. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Use of eMail Addresses and other Contact Information<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
An important part of our services includes being able to provide
information to you. As a result, you expressly consent to receiving
communications from us via email, fax, telephone, mail, text, SMS, or
any other delivery method, including to your cell phone.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
As a customer you are agreeing to receive information about the product
or service you purchased. This may include, but is not limited to,
information about product or service updates, new features, or
information we believe you may find interesting. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We may also send you information about other products and services our company offers. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We will not sell, provide, or transfer you email address to others. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We may allow advertising to our customers, or engage in joint ventures,
which result in your receiving advertisements from selected third
parties. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Identification of Purchasers<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
If you purchase one of our products or services, you authorize us to
use your name and identification information in advertising or
promotions. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We also use personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not
individually attributable to you) for business analysis, operational,
marketing and other promotional purposes. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Unless we provide access to a membership area, account, or provide an
ability to have and change a username, password, email address, or
other similar information, we do not have the capability to allow users
to review and request changes their personal information.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
Cookies and Tracking<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Cookies may be used to keep track of referred affiliate commissions and
to monitor access to our website.  You consent to any future use
of cookies for testing purposes and the use of cookies for publicly
available data to gather statistics for the purpose of determining
which search engines, referring sites, key words, etc., bring visitors
to our website, which pages visitors are most interested in, what web
browsers are used, etc. Various providers may be used for this purpose.
The purpose is to obtain information that will help promote the
website, make the website more interesting and useful to visitors, and
to identify areas where improvement is needed. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Our website does not respond to "do not track" requests
from a web browser or other device, or other similar requests or
procedures.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
Additionally, various third party information suppliers and other
entities that provide information for this website, or for use by us,
may use cookies. Examples include, but are not necessarily limited to
billing providers, third party advertisers, and third party resources
we promote. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
We may also allow third party advertisers to display ads on our
website.  We are not in a position to know if they collect
identifiable information about an individual consumer's online
activities over time and across different websites, so you should
assume they do.  In most web browsers you can choose not to accept
cookies from third party sites or third-party cookies.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
Disclosure by Necessity<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Private information may be disclosed if required by a court order, statute, law, or regulation. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Information is subject to disclosure to address a claim that you are
violating the terms of any agreement pertaining to your use of your use
this website or our products or services, or rights of any third party.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

is necessary to identify, contact or bring an action against someone
who may be causing injury to or interfering (either intentionally or
unintentionally) with our rights or property, your rights or property,
other users of our website, products or services, or anyone else. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
As we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell
or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another
company, or be bought by another company. In such transactions,
personal information may be one of the transferred assets. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which we
maintain facilities or conduct operations. By using our website,
products and services, you consent to any such transfer of information
