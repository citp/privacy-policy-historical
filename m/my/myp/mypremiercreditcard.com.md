# PREMIER Bankcard Privacy Statement

When you provide us with information, you can be sure we will hold your information in strict confidence. We recognize and respect your expectation of privacy will be protected. 

We may share information with outside companies that assist us in providing customers with our products and services. These companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep the information we provide them confidential. We do not share customer information with outside companies for purposes of selling their products and services to you, unless you have been given the opportunity, in advance, to decline this option.

Information may be exchanged with consumer reporting agencies and provided when legally required or permitted in connection with litigation, fraud investigation, or an acquisition or sale.

Our employees access information about you only when needed to maintain your account or otherwise meet your needs. We use proven technology and established procedures for keeping your information secure. Whenever we ask for personal information on our Website or Online Banking, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology) 128-bit encryption to keep it confidential.

You may visit our website to find out about products and services, marketing information, and career opportunities without providing any information about yourself. We do gather data regarding visits to our Website, including domain name, pages visited, length of user session, etc., to evaluate the usefulness of our site. 

The bank may use a software "cookie" when accessing our online banking product. No "cookie" will contain any information, which would enable anyone to contact you via telephone, email, or postal service. (A "cookie" is a small piece of information which a Website stores in the web browser of your PC and can later retrieve. A "cookie" cannot be read by a website other than the one setting the "cookie". You can set your web browser to inform you when "cookies" are set or to prevent "cookies" from being set.)

We do not knowingly solicit data from children and we do not knowingly market to children. We recognize protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.

We take appropriate steps to keep your account information accurate and up to date. If you ever notice your information is not complete, accurate or current, please call us at the telephone number on your account statement. We will correct the information as quickly as possible.

If you believe we have not complied with our Information Practices, you may contact us at the telephone number on your account statement. Please ask for the Risk Management Department. We will investigate and respond to your concern.
