				<p>
					When you provide us with information, you can be sure we will hold your 
					information in strict confidence. We recognize and respect your expectation of 
					privacy will be protected.
					<br>
					<br>
					We may share information with outside companies that assist us in providing 
					customers with our products and services. These companies act on our behalf and 
					are obligated to keep the information we provide them confidential. We do not 
					share customer information with outside companies for purposes of selling their 
					products and services to you, unless you have been given the opportunity, in 
					advance, to decline this option.<br>
					<br>
					Information may be exchanged with consumer reporting agencies and provided when 
					legally required or permitted in connection with litigation, fraud 
					investigation, or an acquisition or sale.<br>
					<br>
					Our employees access information about you only when needed to maintain your 
					account or otherwise meet your needs. We use proven technology and established 
					procedures for keeping your information secure. Whenever we ask for personal 
					information on our Website or Online Banking, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL 
					technology) 128-bit encryption to keep it confidential.<br>
					<br>
					You may visit our website to find out about products and services, marketing 
					information, and career opportunities without providing any information about 
					yourself. We do gather data regarding visits to our Website, including domain 
					name, pages visited, length of user session, etc., to evaluate the usefulness 
					of our site.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bank may use a software "cookie" when accessing our online banking product. 
					No "cookie" will contain any information, which would enable anyone to contact 
					you via telephone, email, or postal service. (A "cookie" is a small piece of 
					information which a Website stores in the web browser of your PC and can later 
					retrieve. A "cookie" cannot be read by a website other than the one setting the 
					"cookie". You can set your web browser to inform you when "cookies" are set or 
					to prevent "cookies" from being set.)<br>
					<br>
					We do not knowingly solicit data from children and we do not knowingly market 
					to children. We recognize protecting children's identities and privacy online 
					is important and the responsibility to do so rests with both the online 
					industry and with parents.<br>
					<br>
					We take appropriate steps to keep your account information accurate and up to 
					date. If you ever notice your information is not complete, accurate or current, 
					please call us at the telephone number on your account statement. We will 
					correct the information as quickly as possible.<br>
					<br>
					If you believe we have not complied with our Information Practices, you may 
					contact us at the telephone number on your account statement. Please ask for 
					the Risk Management Department. We will investigate and respond to your concern.
