<br><br>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

<br><br>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit.

<br><br>You can remove personal information that you have provided to us.  Deleting your information will delete the data only in our database for purposes of managing future communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not delete information already collected that may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Statement. You will need to contact third parties that may contact you directly to delete your personal information that they may be using to contact you.


<br><br><br>SECURITY
<br><br>Protecting your information is important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect the security of your information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and via mobile communications networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
