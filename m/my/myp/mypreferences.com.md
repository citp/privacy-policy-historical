    * Help us provide you with appropriate content and advertising.

  * **Access to Personal Information and Choice**

It’s our policy to allow you to have choices with respect to our use of your personal information and to allow you to access, correct, or delete your personal information in our records. 

With respect to choice, you may opt out or update your topic preferences at any time by clicking on the “Manage Preferences” link in the footer of our commercial emails.

  * **Information Sharing**

PossibleNOW does not sell your personal information to third parties. We may provide your information to third parties or service providers solely to process information on our behalf or provide a service to us, such as fulfilling a direct mail piece or email to our customers; however, PossibleNOW requires that these third parties comply with PossibleNOW's privacy policies when processing this information. 

We may be required to share personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

**Retention of Personal Information**

We will retain your personal information only: 1) for the period necessary to fulfill marketing or service-related communications, 2) until your contact information is no longer valid, or 3) until you request to have your information deleted (unless we have a legitimate reason or are required by law to retain it). 

  * **Use of Cookies and Web Beacons and Site Tracking**

A "web beacon" is a transparent pixel image used in collecting information about website usage, email response and tracking. Web beacons are used to enhance functionality on the site (e.g. user ID and password prompts) and aggregate traffic data (e.g. what pages are most popular).   


A "cookie" is a small text file that a Website can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to download educational content without having to reenter your contact information. The cookie transmits this information back to the Website's computer which is typically the only computer that can read it. Many consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit Websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a Website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer. 

PossibleNOW uses third party applications including, but not limited to, Google Analytics, Oracle Eloqua and Clicky, which may use web beacons or clear gifs to track visitors on any of our Websites. We automatically collect and store; the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our sites; and the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our sites.   


We use this information as anonymous aggregate data to determine the number of visitors to different sections of our sites, to ensure the sites are working properly, and to help us make our sites more useful. 

If a site visitor provides us with contact information through a form submittal, we know the identity of the site visitor and can track and record information about which pages on our website the site visitor views, which helps us provide more relevant information based on their apparent interests.   


  * **Protecting Your Personal Information**

To protect the privacy and security of customer owned data and personally identifiable information you transmit through use of this Site, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees' privacy responsibilities. 

  * **Personal Information from Children**

Because of the nature of our business, our services are not provided to minors. We will not ask minors (including specifically, children under 13) to provide personal information if we have knowledge of their minority status.
