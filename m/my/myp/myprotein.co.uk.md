Cend Limited (t/a myprotein) ( **We** ) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

This policy (together with our [terms of use and supply](https://web.archive.org/customer-services/terms-conditions.list) and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the **Act** ), the data controller is Cend Limited (t/a myprotein.co.uk) whose registered address is Meridian House, Gadbrook Park, Rudheath, Cheshire, CW9 7RA. 

##  INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU

We may collect and process the following data about you:

  * information that you provide by filling in forms on our site www.myprotein.com ( **our site** ). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by Cend Limited (t/a myprotein.co.uk) (or any group company), and when you report a problem with our site;  

  * if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;  

  * we may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them;  

  * details of transactions you carry out through our site and data necessary for the fulfilment of your orders including your name, email address, delivery address, credit/debit card number, security code and expiry date; and  

  * details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own IP addresses.  




We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

##  COOKIES

We collect information about our customers via server logs, cookies, order forms and competitions. A cookie is a file that your web browser places on your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings. The cookie does not store any credit/debit card information nor password details. For further information about the cookies that we use on this website (as well as an explanation as to why we use them and how they can be disabled) please see our [Cookies](https://web.archive.org/customer-services/cookies.list) section. 

##  WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, Chicago (a destination which is outside of the European Economic Area ( **EEA** )). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Shopping on our site is safe and secure. Our site uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to provide encryption of personal information such as your name, address and credit card details. In this way, information passed between your computer and us cannot be read in the unlikely event of someone intercepting it. Credit or debit card transactions are secure.

We will only accept orders using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently reveal personal information by using an unsecure connection. The latest browsers all support SSL. If for any reason this option has been disabled on your browser, you will not be able to transact until you reset these options.

You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock icon or an image of a key in the grey bar at the bottom of your screen. This should appear on any page where you are entering personal information (such as your credit card details) - no other page will transmit information about you.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

##  USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION

We use information held about you in the following ways:

  * to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;   

  * to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes;  

  * to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;  

  * to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and  

  * to notify you about changes to our service.  




If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. 

We may also use your data, or permit our group companies to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, please change the settings in your account. 

We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 100 women aged under the age of 25 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

##  DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;  

  * if Cend Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;  

  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our [ terms of use and supply](https://web.archive.org/customer-services/terms-conditions.list) and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cend Limited, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.

We take the risk of internet fraud very seriously.

There is a possibility we may contact you to make additional security checks and we ask for your co-operation to enable us to complete them. Fraudulent transactions will not be tolerated by us and such transactions will be reported to the relevant authorities.
