## Security Policy

**Shopping with myprotein.co.uk is safe and secure**

Our site uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to provide encryption of personal information such as your name, address and credit card details. In this way, information passed between your computer and us cannot be read in the unlikely event of someone intercepting it. Credit or Debit card transactions are secure.

We will only accept orders using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently reveal personal information by using an unsecure connection. The latest versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer (3.0 and up) and Netscape Navigator (3.02 and up) both support this secure connection. If for any reason this option has been disabled on your browser, you will not be able to transact until you reset these options.

For Netscape go to Communicator, Tools, Security Info, Navigator and tick 'Enable SSLv2' and 'Enable SSLv3' boxes

For Internet Explorer go to Tools, Internet Options, Advanced and tick the 'Use SSL 2.0' and 'Use SSL 3.0' boxes under 'Security'

You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock icon (Internet Explorer) or an image of a key (Netscape) in the grey bar at the bottom of your screen. This should appear on any page where you are entering personal information (such as your credit card details) - no other page will transmit information about you.

If you have an earlier version of Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, we suggest that you download a free upgrade by clicking below:

[Internet Explorer (latest version)](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp)

**Installation Instructions**

Other than when we process your original payment or process a refund for you, your credit card details are displayed in a truncated form with only the first 4 digits and the last 4 digits visible. For example your receipt will print a partial credit card number in this way. This means that you will be able to check which card payment was taken against, but in the unlikely event of your parcel being stolen, your full credit card number would not be revealed.
