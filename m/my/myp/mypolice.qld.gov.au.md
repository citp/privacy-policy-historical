# Privacy Statement

### ​Queensland Police Service Internet Site: Privacy and Collection Statement

The Queensland Police Service (QPS) has established responsible and accountable collection and management guidelines to protect personal information within the Service against loss, misuse or inappropriate modification or disclosure.

QPS information management policies and procedures conform to the requirements of the [ _Police Service Administration Act 1990_](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_P.htm), [ _Public Service Act 2008_](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_P.htm), [ _Public Service Regulations 2008_](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_P.htm) and [ _Information Privacy Act 2009_](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2009/09AC014.pdf "Information Privacy Act 2009"). Accountability requirements under these legislative provisions and the [ _Crime and Corruption Act 2001_](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_C.htm) apply to any alleged contravention of authorised procedures.

Personal information is defined by Information Privacy Act 2009 as, "information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion".

### Privacy Overview

​Information Privacy relates to the fair collection and handling of personal information. The Information Privacy Act 2009 (IP Act) sets out the ways in which Queensland Government agencies must handle personal information and also provides individuals with access and amendments rights to their own personal information. Eleven Information Privacy Principles (IPPs), contained within the IP Act, along with other relevant sections, govern the way Queensland government agencies collect, store, access and use personal information.

Personal information is defined in the IP Act as information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion. Examples of personal information include a person’s name and address, date of birth, physical characteristics including height, birthmarks and tattoos.

### Collection of Information

​In order to perform its statutory functions and responsibilities, QPS needs to deal with personal information. These responsibilities include but are not limited to: law enforcement, community safety, road safety and justice services, the investigation of offences, the detection of offenders and the gathering of intelligence information.

QPS’ functions and responsibilities are set out in the _Police Service Administration Act (1990)_.

### Use of Information

​​While QPS will use personal information to inform statistical reporting, the identities of individuals will not be reported. 

Information provided will be used to process your application, create a Police Report, and/or resolve your complaint, compliment or query. Your personal information will be managed in compliance with the _Information Privacy Act 2009_.

### Disclosure of Information

​If QPS discloses personal information to other State and Federal Government agencies, this will only occur where one of the following has occurred: the individuals concerned have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is in accordance with the _Information Privacy Act 2009_ or the disclosure is authorised or required under a law. 

### Security of Information

​QPS personnel are not permitted to access, record or disclose an individual's personal information except in the performance of their duties or in specific situations permitted by law.

While QPS provides a secure Information Storage and Security Environment, you should be aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to communicate with the QPS online, there are alternate contact methods of obtaining and providing information (including phone, mail and in person). In some circumstances, QPS guidelines may require us to send particular information by non-electronic means.
