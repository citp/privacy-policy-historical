</ul><p>The TRUSTe program covers the websites in English (<a href="http://www.xango.com">www.xango.com</a>), Dutch (<a href="http://www.xango.nl">www.xango.nl</a>), French (<a href="http://www.xango.fr">www.xango.fr</a>), Italian (<a href="http://www.xango.it">www.xango.it</a>) and Spanish (<a href="http://www.xango.com.es">www.xango.com.es</a>).

<p>XANGO complies with the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. XANGO has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

<p><strong>1. Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
XANGO collects information on the Site at two different stages. First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information (such as domain name or IP address) from all visitors to the Site. This type of information is never linked to any personal information and is only used in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of the Site.</p>
<p>Second, we require the submission of certain personal information when you use the services available on the Site. For example, your use of your username and password allows us to identify you as a distributor of XANGO® products. We also collect billing and payment information such as your name, postal and email address.</p>
<p><strong>2. Personal Information of Children Under 13</strong><br>
XANGO complies with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the FTC’s rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). This Site is not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age through this Site.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, XANGO does not sell, rent, or share user information to or with any third party not affiliated with or owned by XANGO, except service providers who may assist XANGO in areas such as data storage. XANGO will never give or sell your personal information to be used for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial offers (such as spam) from any third party. We will not ourselves use your personal information to send you unsolicited commercial offers. However, we may need to contact you for purposes other than marketing, as for example regarding the status of the Site, your account or other matters related to your role as a distributor of XANGO® products. You may not opt-out of these kinds of communications. If you wish to unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please follow the directions in the emails or go to the e-mail maintenance option in the account settings page.</p>
<p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering live chat customer support. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use of Aggregate Information</strong><br>
We store information that we collect through log files to create a profile of our users. Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personal information. A profile is stored information detailing how individual users use the Site. It is used solely for internal purposes, to help us improve the experience of our users. We do not share your profile with any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>5. Tracking Technologies</strong><br>

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Xango LLC, and our marketing and payment partners, system partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>).

<p>Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p>
<p><strong>6. Disclosure of Personal Information As Required By Law</strong><br>
We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights, or (c) protect the rights, property, and other interests of our users or others.</p>
<p><strong>7. Business Transfers</strong><br>
In the event XANGO goes through a business transition or a transfer, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, or in the unlikely event that XANGO goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, our users’ personal information may be part of the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of XANGO or its assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>8. Links</strong><br>
The Site contains links to other web sites. XANGO is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every web site that collects personal information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Site.</p>
<p><strong>9. Social Media and Widgets</strong><br>
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><strong>10. Security</strong><br>
XANGO takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect your information. When you enter sensitive information on our order forms like Credit card information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p>
<p>We also make an effort to protect your information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store your personal information are housed in a secure environment.</p>
<p>When registering for access to a secure area of the Site, we will ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when accessing your computer.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our Site, you can send a message to the webmaster at <a href="mailto:webmaster@xango.com">webmaster@xango.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>11. Correcting, Updating, Deleting and Deactivating Personal Information</strong><br>
If your personal information changes, you may contact us to correct, update or delete and deactivate our record of your personal information. We will respond to requests for access to personal information within a reasonable time frame. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><strong>12. Testimonials</strong><br>
With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at <a href="mailto:service@xango.com">service@xango.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13. Notification of Changes</strong><br>
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will prominently post a notice on the main page and other pages to alert you of the change. If the Privacy Policy changes materially so that your personal information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you by e-mail to give you a choice as to whether or not we may use your information in this different manner. However, you are responsible for ensuring we have a current working e-mail address for you. If the e-mail address you have given us is incorrect or no longer operable, we will have no further obligation to notify you apart from posting the notice on our Site. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on the main page notifying users of the change prior to the change becoming effective. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
