## What information Does MyXango.com Collect?

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, tracking your orders and Powerline, sending commission checks, improving our site, and communicating with you.

When ordering products and/or registering on the site, we need you to provide certain information in order for us to create a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to MyXango.com, LLC., and receive back either the information or products desired.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses MyXanGo.com or any of the other MyXanGo.com sites.

MyXanGo.com uses cookies so that they can help provide its visitors with a better experience on our site.

## Security of Personal Information

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission of sensitive/credit data by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. User personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.

## What Information can I access?

MyXanGo.com gives you access to the following information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. This list may change as our Web site evolves.

To request such review or to give instructions regarding the information we have collected about a child, parents/legal guardians should contact us.

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to this or any other web site. Although guest under eighteen years of age may be allowed, with their parent's permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to such guest's parents or guardian.
