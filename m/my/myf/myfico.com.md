## 6\. FICO Business Solutions That Process Personal Data

A. _Business Solutions._ FICO sells, licenses, hosts, and distributes software solutions, such as predictive models and analytics, which are built with depersonalized (anonymized or pseudonymised) data. FICO clients use the solutions for their business purposes. Some solutions are operational: these solutions assist a company in its resource planning, financial projections, and record-keeping, for example. Other solutions facilitate the processing of consumers' personal data. Those solutions are designed to be used for:

  1. new customer acquisition — to predict which consumers are likely to buy certain products or services; marketing solutions process personal data, which may include the age, gender, marital status, and buying patterns of financially and demographically similar consumers, to determine whether a company's products and services match other consumers' product preferences and their inclination and ability to purchase the products and services.
  2. credit and insurance eligibility — to predict which consumers and current customers are good candidates for financial, insurance, or retail services; credit risk solutions may process personal data, as permitted by law, from (i) an applicant's credit application, (ii) an applicant's past credit history (including loan, telecommunication, and rental payments), (iii) an applicant's cash flow, and (iv) social media, to assess an applicant's credit or insurance risk.
  3. financial fraud detection and prevention — to verify the identity of an applicant for credit, and to prevent fraudulent financial transactions; some financial fraud solutions process personal data from a consumer's application and the consumer's past credit activity to verify the identity of the consumer requesting credit; other financial fraud solutions process personal data about a current customer's past shopping and purchasing behavior, to protect the customer from unauthorized access to the customer's accounts.
  4. healthcare fraud detection — to identify and prevent fraudulent or improper healthcare transactions; healthcare fraud solutions process personal data about individual health care claimants from the claimant's healthcare provider's claims records and the claim records of other health care providers, to identify fraudulent behaviors by the health care claimant.
  5. customer management — to determine which customers would benefit from enhanced or additional services; customer management solutions may process personal data about a customer's payment history, past purchases, and customer service interactions to match customer expectations with available services.
  6. debt management — to determine whether debt counseling, debt settlement, debt collection, litigation, or other activity is appropriate for a credit grantor or debt buyer; debt collection solutions may process personal data from the data subject, credit bureaus, and other debt collectors, to assess the size and age of the consumer's debt, the consumer's past payment history, and the consumer's current financial situation to find an appropriate response to a consumer's credit delinquency.



B. _Automated Decisions, Including Profiling._ FICO predictive models can be used to make automated decisions, including profiling. In building and updating these models, FICO reviews the data sets used to address any prejudicial elements, and reviews the correlations indicated by the model to address any non-empirical or non-intuitive results. When FICO hosts the models, FICO audits the performance of its algorithms that drive these models, and regularly reviews the accuracy and relevance of the automated decision-making, including profiling, that results from the use of the models. FICO has strict procedures and measures designed to prevent errors, inaccuracies, or discrimination on the basis of special category data. The outcome of such measures is fed back into the system design.

Some FICO models utilize explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in model development and model operation. One component of AI, called machine learning, adapts through progressive learning algorithms to let the data do the programming. Machine learning finds structure and regularities in data so that the algorithms acquire the ability to classify data and predict outcomes. Machine learning algorithms are built with relevant variables called "features", and the process of extracting features is called "feature engineering". This technique of deriving features, which can be automated, is a way to inject expert knowledge into the process of building and deploying accurate machine learning models. Explainable AI inspects relationships among features that drive model outputs and the decisions based on these models. FICO observes the model output of all expert derived features, and the relationships predicted by the models, to prevent bias, ensure palatability, prevent overfitting, and avoid spurious correlation learned through historical data.

  * _Right to Object to Automated Decision-Making_. If your personal data is used to make a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal or significant effects concerning you, you have the right to object. We reserve the right to make such decision if the use of your personal data is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between us. In that event, we will protect your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including the right to speak to a human to express your point of view and contest our decision.
  * _Right to File a Complaint_. You have the right to file a complaint with us and with a supervisory authority.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us as described in this Policy.
  3. _Onward Transfer_. If we transfer personal data to a third party that is acting as an agent, we will (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal data transferred in a manner consistent with the organization's obligations under the Principles; (iv) require the agent to notify the organization if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department of Commerce upon request.

  5. _Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation_. We will collect and retain personal data that is relevant to the purposes of processing, and not in a way incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
  6. _Access_. You will have access to personal data about yourself that we hold, and you may correct amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the privacy risks in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated.

  7. _Recourse, Enforcement and Liability_. FICO will maintain a mechanism to provide that your complaints or disputes are investigated and resolved, and damages awarded where applicable law so provides.
