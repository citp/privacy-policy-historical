**1.    INTRODUCTION**

Fox Television Stations, Inc., and certain of its affiliated entities (collectively, “FTS”  or “we”) operate news and entertainment websites (each an “FTS Website”) on behalf of their owned and operated television stations (the “Fox Television Stations”). The services FTS offers may include photos, videos, applications, community pages, message boards and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by FTS in connection with the Fox Television Stations, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devices (collectively, the “FTS Services”). FTS is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.

As set forth in our [Terms of Service](http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/about_us/terms_of_service/Terms_Of_Service), the FTS Websites are general audience sites, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use some of the FTS Services without being registered or subscribing to a FTS Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to any FTS Service, for example to create an account or profile, enter contests or sweepstakes, receive a newsletter, play a game or take a survey. This Privacy Policy describes FTS’s collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the FTS Services. It also describes generally FTS’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.

**2.    SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON FTS SERVICES**

_User Submitted Information_

**Registration Information** is the information that users must provide to FTS at   
registration for or upon subscription to a FTS Service, for example, to create an account or profile, enter a contest or sweepstakes, receive a newsletter, play a game or take a survey. Each FTS Website may require different information from you to register or subscribe, such as, name, username, email address and/or birthday.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you post   
to the FTS Services and the information about you that accompanies those   
posts, such as a username or user picture, or if the FTS Website offers user   
profiles, your profile content. Public Information and Posts will be public unless   
the FTS Website states that certain information, content or posts will not be   
made public or gives you the opportunity to use privacy settings to make it non-   
public. When information is public, this means it will be available to everyone   
and will be displayed in search results both on the FTS Services and on external   
search engines. Each FTS Website may offer different opportunities for Public   
Information and Posts.

_FTS Services Collected Information_

**Service Activity Information.** When users access the FTS Services, we may collect   
certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in   
order to permit your connection to the FTS Services, our servers receive and record

information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address,   
browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the FTS   
Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier   
assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device. We also   
may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels,   
beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. This data is sent to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the FTS Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your   
settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block   
cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more   
information (e.g., [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-   
allow-cookies](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies)). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including   
cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see   
<http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>.   
Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to   
certain features or personalization available through the FTS Services.

Sometimes, we collect personal information from consumers in manual or off-   
line format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in   
those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided   
with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy   
and other relevant information from us.

**Third Parties.** To improve the quality of the FTS Services, we may supplement   
the information we collect with information from third parties. If you access the   
FTS Services through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect   
your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, and any   
information you have made public in connection with that service or which the   
third party shares with partner services.

Third parties that support the FTS Services by serving advertisements or providing   
other services may also use tracking technologies. FTS does not control these third-   
party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

**3.    NOTICE & CHOICE**

**Means of Notice and Choice.** This Privacy Policy and where offered by a FTS   
Website, your privacy settings, are the primary means by which FTS provides you with   
notice and choice about its collection and use of your personal information. FTS will   
not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this   
Privacy Policy without your permission.

**Privacy Policy Changes.** FTS may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary. If   
we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your   
personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent through email or a   
prominent posting on the site.

**Location of Data.** The FTS Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a   
user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any   
personal information you provide transferred to, processed, and stored in the United   
States and other countries where data protection and other privacy laws may not offer   
the same level of protection as in the jurisdiction where you may be located, such as the European Union. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

**Linked Services.** The FTS Services may also be linked to sites or services operated   
by FTS affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: [“Affiliated Companies”](http://www.newscorp.com/))   
or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games,   
newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by   
third parties. FTS is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties,   
and once you leave the FTS Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click   
an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party   
site. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation   
corporate [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still   
refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy   
Policy.

**4.    USE AND DISCLOSURE**

_Information Made Public Through Use of the FTS Services and User Privacy Settings_

Any Public Information and Posts are always publicly available to everyone, including   
other users, Search Engines, and anyone else with access to the FTS Services.

when we believe sharing is permitted by you or authorized by this Privacy Policy. In   
addition, FTS may share your personal information with Affiliated Companies.

We use the information we collect from and about users for the following purposes:

**To provide and manage the FTS Services.** We use the information we collect from   
and about users to provide the FTS Services and features to you including to measure and improve those services and features, to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, advertising and marketing messages, to allow you to comment on content, participate in online games, contests or promotions, to enable you to communicate and share with other users or services, and to provide you with customer support and respond to inquiries. We may use aggregated, anonymous data about use of and activity on the FTS Services to assist us in this regard and such data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

**To allow third-party service providers to assist us in providing and managing  
the FTS Services**. FTS may make your non-public personal information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the FTS Services. These outside service providers are required to protect non-public personal information entrusted to them and not use it for any other purpose than the specific service they are providing to FTS.

**To deliver relevant advertising.** We may use the information you provide to us,   
and information we collect about your use of the FTS Services through cookies and   
other technologies, to assist us in delivering you relevant ads when you visit the FTS   
Services. We may work with third-party advertising networks and advertisers who   
help deliver these ads to you. We do not share your non-public personal information   
with these third parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information   
with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on the FTS Services. As noted   
above, these third-party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests. To find out more about third-party online advertising and to opt out of this type of advertising from participating networks, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

**To contact you.** FTS may periodically send promotional materials, newsletters or   
notifications related to the FTS Services to the email address you provided to us at   
registration. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from FTS, you can   
follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. There are certain   
service notification emails that you may not opt-out of as long as you are registered or   
subscribed to the FTS Services, such as notifications of changes to the FTS Services or policies.

**To protect the rights of the FTS Services and our users.** There may be instances   
when FTS may disclose user information without providing notice or choice, including situations where FTS has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of FTS, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of users of the FTS Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.

**To complete a merger or sale of assets.** If FTS sells all or part of its business or   
makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, FTS may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

**5.    SECURITY**

FTS uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical   
measures to safeguard user information in its possession against loss, theft and   
unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.

**6.    USER CONTROL AND ACCOUNT CANCELATION**

Remember that even after you cancel your account or subscription, copies of some   
information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances – where,   
for example, you have shared information with another user or a third-party application   
or website. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our   
servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from search engines.
