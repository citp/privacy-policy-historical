      <p class="body"> MyFamily.com recognizes the potential sensitivity of confidential 
        information that may be placed on member family Web sites and is firmly 
        committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information 
        gathering and dissemination practices for this site.</p>
      <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Overview</span><br>
        None of the personal, private information that is uploaded or entered 
        on a MyFamily.com Web site by individual members is viewed by MyFamily.com, 
        or distributed to others outside of your site (except in rare cases involving 
        reported violations of our use policies or legal statutes.) We do collect 
        some data, always with your knowledge and consent, which is used to personalize 
        the site for your convenience and for the benefit of other family members 
        and friends who are included in your site. </p>
      <p class="body">A portion of this data, particularly that which reflects 
        members’ lifestyles and interests, may be used in aggregate statistical 
        form to attract potential sponsors and deliver advertising messages to 
        appropriate users. For instance we might tell a prospective advertiser 
        that 10,000 of our members have indicated an interest in golf, and then 
        distribute an attractive offer exclusively to those users. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>In no case is the personal information about individual 
        members sold or otherwise shared with advertisers, sponsors, partners 
        or other 3<sup>rd</sup> parties.</b> And under no circumstances is this 
        information collected or distributed in any form without your prior knowledge 
        and consent. </p>
      <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Special privacy policy concerning 
        children 13 and younger. </span><br>
        MyFamily.com, Inc. believes that the Internet is an important tool in 
        connecting and strengthening families, but also recognizes that young 
        children need help and protection while using this tool. In that light, 
        and in compliance with the letter and spirit of laws designed to protect 
        children and encourage parental responsibility for children using the 
        Internet, we have adopted this special policy concerning children 13 or 
        under. <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> We will require children 13 or under to obtain parental approval 
          before registering as a member of a MyFamily site using the MyFamily.com 
          service. During the sign up process to begin, or to become a member 
          of, a MyFamily.com site, each potential member will be required to certify 
          that he or she is over the age of 13, or obtain parental permission 
          to proceed with the registration. In the case of a child registrant, 
          a parent will be asked to provide an e-mail address which is not the 
          same as the address used by the child, and will then receive an e-mail 
          asking for confirmation that the parent approves the child's participation. 
          The child's registration will not be activated until a response from 
          the parent to that email is received. </li>
        <li> All children 13 or under who become members of a MyFamily site will 
          be "opted out" of receiving any communication from MyFamily.com at the 
          time of their registration. As members of the site, they will able to 
          "opt in" to site notifications, but not into newsletters or other communications 
          not resulting from a site event. </li>
        <li> Parents and site administrators should remember that MyFamily private 
          sites are indeed private, the user provided content in the site feature 
          areas on them is not accessed nor controlled by us. Parents, site administrators 
          and other members of a MyFamily site should be sensitive to the degree 
          that young people participate in a family site and assure that content 
          provided by young people is submitted and used only in an appropriate 
          manner. </li>
        <li> Parents will be allowed to request information from MyFamily.com,Inc. 
          about what information their child has provided by their child and is 
          kept by us. We will require positive identification of the parent and 
          their relationship before we release that information to the parent.

        <b><a name="1">Who will be able to view our private family Web site?</a></b></p>
      <p class="body">Only those with a valid username and password have access 
        to your site. Initially, the family site administrator (creator) will 
        invite new members and assign a temporary username and password. As family 
        members register, they may change their passwords to ensure complete security 
        and privacy. It is then the responsibility of site members to help keep 
        the site secure by offering password access only to appropriate relatives 
        and friends – those they want to have access to the site. Each user is 
        responsible to protect his or her username &amp; password. In the future, 
        MyFamily.com may provide "guest areas" so guests can view certain information 
        without a username and password. </p>

      <p class="body"><b><a name="2">Does MyFamily.com ask for personal information?</a></b></p>
      <p class="body">Yes. MyFamily.com asks for your name, email address, and 
        other limited personal information when you sign up to create or participate 
        in a family Web site and to use features such as e-mail, chat, personality 
        profiles, and gift registries. Most of this information may be entered 
        at your option. We may ask for similar information at other times, such 
        as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by MyFamily.com 
        and/or our partners. </p>
      <p class="breadcrumb" align="center"><a href="#faqs">Back to Faq's</a></p>
      <p class="body"><b><a name="3">How Does MyFamily.com use my personal information?</a></b></p>
      <p class="body">Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, 
        user-friendly Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal 
        information is to share it with other family members and friends when 
        they visit your site. </p>
      <p class="body">MyFamily.com will also use registration and profile information 
        to advise you of new members and new postings to the site, to let you 
        know about new features or other offers of interest from MyFamily.com, 
        or to address customer service needs and requests. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="body">In order to make the site more relevant to you we also direct 
        advertising from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. 
        For instance, if you indicate an interest in cooking in your member profile, 
        you may see an ad from Betty Crocker, while your brother, who likes sports 
        might see an Adidas ad. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable 
        to each family member. </p>
      <p class="body">In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages,<b> the advertiser 
        never has access to individual account information. MyFamily.com does 
        not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide 
        us. </b>Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience 
        they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year 
        olds interested in outdoor sports). MyFamily.com then displays the ad 
        only to users who meet those criteria. </p>
      <p class="body">MyFamily.com works with a third party that serves ads to 
        this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information

      <p class="body">MyFamily.com offers products and services for sale in our

        credit or debit card information. In order to take advantage of other

        information, except with your knowledge and consent as described below, 
        or as may be required by law, or to protect the rights or property of 
        MyFamily.com. </p>
      <p class="body">Most personal information collected by MyFamily.com is made 
        available only to other members of your family site, such as in the family 
        address book or member profiles. Other circumstances where limited personal 
        information may be disclosed are specifically described when the data 
        is collected, such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes 
        or other promotions. So in all cases you control what, if any information 
        you make available </p>
      <p class="body">MyFamily.com does reserve the right to disclose aggregated 
        user statistics, such as "45 percent of our users are female" or "10,000 
        members indicate an interest in gardening" in order to describe our services 
        to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection 
        of confidentiality agreements, MyFamily.com may match common user information, 
        such as name, address and phone number, with third party data to avoid 
        duplication and prevent errors. </p>
      <p class="body">Additionally, if you click away from MyFamily.com to visit 
        the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for 
        your credit card or other personal information in order purchase or use 
        products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy 
        and data collection practices. MyFamily.com has no responsibility or liability

      <p class="body">Only at your option. MyFamily.com can automatically send 
        email messages to advise members when new information has been posted 
        to the family Web site. Participating members may also send email to the 
        entire family group or selected individuals, at their discretion. These 
        options are user selectable. </p>
      <p class="body">MyFamily.com may also occasionally send information about 
        special product and service offerings that we feel may be of interest

      <p class="body"><b><a name="7">May I refuse to provide personal information 
        to MyFamily.com or to accept advertising?</a></b></p>
      <p class="body">Yes on both counts. Most of the personal information provided 
        to MyFamily.com may be offered at your own discretion and is intended 
        for family use only. A username and e-mail address are all that are required 
        to participate in the site. Naturally, withholding some personal information 
        may compromise the usefulness of the site for other family members. Because 
        the MyFamily.com site is advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" 
        the advertising that appears on family Web site pages, but you may opt 
        to be excluded from any email advertising. </p>

      <p class="body"><b>IP Addresses:</b> We do use your IP address to help diagnose 
        problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address 
        is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic 
        distribution of our members. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>MyFamily.com Cookies:</b> Contrary to popular myth, cookies 
        do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, 
        but rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering 
        or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive 
        of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that enable our 
        server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. 
        MyFamily.com does make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific 
        to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain your personal 
        preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save 
        your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.</p>

      <p class="body">The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in 
        context above: </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Member Profiles: </b>Demographic and personality profile 
        data is collected at our site at the users’ option. This information may 
        include age and gender plus hobbies, interests, and other personal preferences 
        that can be viewed by other family members who have access to the site. 
        Some of this statistical demographic information may also be used on an 
        aggregate basis to attract advertisers and to deliver offers and information 
        to specific members, or to "customize" a visitor’s experience. In no case 
        is this information given to a third party. MyFamily.com controls the 
        distribution of ALL information at the site. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Contests &amp; Promotions: </b>MyFamily.com may occasionally 
        run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members 
        or visitors for contact information (like an email address) or demographic 
        information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this data 
        to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. 
        The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor 
        when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional 
        purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and 
        conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, 
        users may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply 
        decline to take part in the promotions. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Opt-Out: </b>Our site provides users the ability to opt-out 
        of receiving direct advertising communications from our partners and sponsors. 
        This option may be selected by any user on the "preferences" page. We 
        always reserve the right to contact members about service or payment issues, 
        new features to improve the service, etc. </p>
