## General Privacy Policy In Brief

What you really need to know about the Privacy Policy of Family Travel Forum Inc. is that we respect your privacy and have a commitment to guarding any personal or other information collected from you while using any of our websites or services.

Family Travel Forum Inc. may collect different types of personal or other information about site visitors who voluntarily subscribe, register for a membership, complete a survey, register for an online forum, enter a contest or provide an email address; and may track information about individuals' website usage on the Family Travel Forum Inc. websites.

Family Travel Forum Inc. will not share, barter, rent or sell any personal information received during its transactions or communications with site visitors, users, registered users or members without their prior knowledge and express permission. However, Family Travel Forum Inc. may use this data about all site visitors and their travel patterns, as a group, to improve the relevance of our content and support our travelers' network.

Family Travel Forum Inc. provides content and forums to children but does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13, even as group data. We encourage parents to monitor children's use of this and all other Internet sites and to have minors ask for permission to share any information with this or any other site. If you are a parent and feel that your child may have submitted personally identifiable information that you would like us to delete, please contact us at 212-595-6074 or by email at [FTF@familytravelforum.com](mailto:FTF@familytravelforum.com).

Communication is important to our community of family travelers and their children, and receiving e-mail updates about family vacations and travel news is one of the primary benefits of registering with Family Travel Forum Inc. or any of its online properties. We appreciate your interest and pledge to send only travel or parenting-related news and product information to those who register with our e-mail list. Additionally, each email will explain how to unsubscribe from our list if you ever choose to no longer receive these updates or remove your email address.

## Specific Details About Information Use

Specifically, Family Travel Forum, Inc., publisher of the sites noted above, regards all personal information collected from you, our valued site visitors, as completely confidential. This includes personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information provided during transactions. Family Travel Forum Inc. pledges not to share personal data on any of its members or site visitors with outside parties. However, Family Travel Forum Inc. does offer aggregated data about site visitors overall, and their travel patterns and preferences as a group, to its consulting division, marketing partners and advertisers. This includes traffic data, click- through rates, website users' geographic location, content information, and any demographic information offered by the website member for the purpose of facilitating an advertising sale. Our goal is to provide you and your family with the best, most relevant information when you visit our sites.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our registration or order forms, we, or the e- commerce sites we partner with, encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [Learn more about SSL at this page](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html). Family Travel Forum Inc. follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our websites, you can send us a message to [FTF@familytravelforum.com](mailto:FTF@familytravelforum.com).

## Bulletin Boards / Chat Rooms / Blogs / Community

If you use a Family Travel Forum Inc. bulletin board, chat room, blog or community feature linked from or on any of these sites, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Family Travel Forum Inc. is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Any information you disclose when posting to a bulletin board, chat room, blog or community feature, including your registered user ID screen name becomes public and may be used by Family Travel Forum Inc. for online or offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.

## Correcting / Updating / Deleting / Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, Family Travel Forum Inc. members, users and site visitors can send their request via web forms or by email and we will change the information requested. Site visitors can view and edit their personal information by logging in and visiting the Members Profile section of the appropriate website. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Ad servers or websites.

## COPPA Compliance

Family Travel Forum Inc. does not knowingly collect or store any personal information, even in an aggregate form, about site users ages 12 and under. The Family Travel Forum Inc. owned and operated sites are free services for users, with travel and vacation content and community features to be used by registered students and others ages 13 and older. When younger children access this and other Family Travel Forum Inc. sites it should be under the guidance of parents. When children younger than 13 years make contributions to these sites they must have the express written permission of their parents. Please use the Family Travel Forum Inc. permission form for minor children [found on this page](http://www.myfamilytravels.com/info/consent) and submit it to our staff for approval in order to activate your minor child's account.

## Ad Server and Third Party Collection of Data

All users who receive an ad served by Family Travel Forum Inc.'s ad serving partners retain complete anonymity. As ads are delivered, advertisers may use software called "cookies" to collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. These servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. Because our sites are partially supported by internet advertising, we use the Doubleclick Ad Serving platform and Google AdWords, which uses cookies that collect anonymous data for remarketing, interest categories, similar audiences, other types of interest-based advertising, and demographic and location targeting. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of making ads more relevant to you, and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of the ad server's clients and customers. If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, you may either visit each ad server's web site individually and register your choice ("opt out") or you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative 's ("NAI") site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) to opt-out of many of the third-party advertising companies' cookies. There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, an ad server (or a third party working in conjunction with the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. This information is used by the client so the user can receive the goods or services requested. When requested, ad servers may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, Family Travel Forum Inc. will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Regardless of later updates, Family Travel Forum Inc. will never use the information you submit under this current policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.

Rest assured that we have deep respect for your privacy. If you believe we have not met this commitment to online privacy for you or your family, please contact Customer Service at 212/595-6074 or via email at [FTF@familytravelforum.com](mailto:FTF@familytravelforum.com).
