We understand and respect your desire to know how information about you will be collected, used and kept secure. 
We've created this description to provide you meaningful information about the privacy practices and policies 
applicable to www.myFICO.com.</p>
            
<h4>Putting Your Information to Work</h4>
<p>We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:
</p><ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you, such as when you register for and order the services we provide, whether 
	alone or in conjunction with other companies (the "Services"), or such as when you send us E-mail, applications 
	and other forms.</li>
	<li>Information we receive or have access to about your transactions with us, our affiliates and others.</li> 
	<li>Information we receive from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies and companies that provide 
	demographic information.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>We use this information to provide the Services to you and to provide support for the Services, as well as for 
various internal business purposes such as: customer service; fraud prevention; internal investigations; providing 
you information relating to the Services; and broadening and improving the services and products we and our 
affiliates can offer.</p>

<p>The personally identifiable information that we collect from you may include the following:
</p><ul>
	<li>First and last name</li>
	<li>Current and previous home address, including street name, city or town, state, and zip code</li>
	<li>E-mail address</li>
	<li>Telephone numbers</li>
	<li>Social security number</li>
	<li>Driver's license number</li>
	<li>Information found in your credit report, including your credit score (if you order a product that 
	includes a credit report and/or score)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h4>Disclosing Your Information</h4>
<p>We may disclose any and all of the information we collect, as described above, to the following types of 
unaffiliated third parties (companies that are not owned or controlled by us) for various business purposes, 
including marketing and joint business efforts for related and unrelated products and services:
</p><ul>
	<li>Financial services providers, such as banks and mortgage lenders.</li>
	<li>Non-financial companies such as retailers, direct marketers and publishers.</li>
	<li>Companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and companies with which we have joint 
	marketing agreements.</li>
	<li>Others, as permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>We may also disclose any of the information we collect to companies that are related to us by common 
ownership or affiliated with us by common control. We may disclose information as described above whether 
you are a consumer who purchases a one-time service, a customer with whom we have an ongoing relationship, 
or a former customer. However, we will not disclose to third parties the credit report or credit score 
calculated in providing any Service without your prior specific approval; nor will we will disclose your 
E-mail address to any third party. If Fair Isaac is acquired by or merges with another company, or if the 
business of the myFICO division of Fair Isaac is acquired by another company, information will be transferred 
to the acquiring company. Fair Isaac may also share information in order to comply with the law, e.g., in 
response to subpoenas or to assert or defend legal claims, and in order to investigate or respond to actual 
or suspected illegal activities, fraud, and threats of physical harm.</p>

<h4>Your Right to Choose</h4>
<p>If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you, you may opt out of such 
disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make these disclosures. You may also opt out if you prefer 
that we not send you offers regarding products and services. If you exercise this opt out we will not send 
you any product or service offers, except that we may, as part of the Services, tell you about credit products 
that may be available to you. You may exercise your right to opt out when you register for the Services by 
checking "No" in answer to the question in the order form regarding sharing of your information. You may 
also exercise your right to opt out any time by logging into Member Services, clicking on "Manage Member 
Information", and checking "No" to the same question. Please note that your decision to opt out will not apply 
to certain disclosures that are specifically permitted by law; for example, the Services cannot operate unless 
we transmit data to companies that help us provide the Services, such as by providing us with credit reports or 
processing credit card charges. Your decision to opt out also will not apply to disclosures or communications 
to which you consent.</p>

<p>You will be able to change the personal information you have provided to us by logging into the myFICO 
member center with your login ID and password. You will not be able to change personal information that we 
have obtained from third parties.</p>

<h4>Keeping Your Information Secure</h4>
<p>Except for the disclosures and uses described above, we restrict access to nonpublic personal information 
about you to those employees and companies that provide services and need to know that information to provide 
the Services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic 
personal information. Information you provide to us when you register for and order the Services is transmitted 
to us through a secured socket layer (SSL) transmission. In addition, information we collect is subject to 
numerous measures designed to help protect it from unauthorized access or alteration, including for example, 
internal and external firewalls, physical security measures, and encryption of certain information. Of course, 
you must do your part to ensure the security of your information; for example, you must guard your password 
and not permit unauthorized use of your account. No security measures can provide absolute protection of data, 
but we will strive to provide a superior level of protection for your information.</p>

<p>To the extent our Web site contains links to other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
or content of such other sites.</p>

<h4>What About Cookies?</h4>
<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so 
the information can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the browser to identify itself to the 
server, and allow the server to maintain an active "session" with an individual user. Cookies help the browser 
remember some specific information. We make limited use of cookies.</p>

<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
<p>This site and the Service are intended for use only by adults. We will not knowingly solicit or collect 
information from children.</p>

<h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>

unless a different privacy policy is provided in connection with a specific Service. Certain practices 
described and rights provided in this Privacy Policy may not apply to institutional users or individuals who
