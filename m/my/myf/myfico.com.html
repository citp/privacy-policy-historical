<p>
The FICO Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") sets forth FICO’s commitment to protecting personally identifiable information we obtain about you when you register to use one of our Web sites or become our customer by obtaining a product from us to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes ("<u>Personal Information</u>").  The Privacy Policy applies to current customers, former customers, and applicants for our products.
 
</p>


<p>

<u>Information Collected From Business Clients.</u>&nbsp; This Privacy Policy generally does not apply to personally identifiable information collected, used and disclosed pursuant to contractual agreements between FICO and its business clients. However, the Personal Data Security and Confidentiality section of this FICO Privacy Policy is applicable to all personally identifiable information held at FICO. Subject to contractual restrictions, FICO may use such personally identifiable information to send business clients or other businesses information about FICO or other marketing opportunities via telephone, automated email messages, and direct mail.  Email messages may contain web beacons and other features that tell us the message was received and opened. At any time the recipient may opt out of receiving further email communications from us by clicking the unsubscribe link that appears in all FICO email messages. Any business may also opt out of receiving any marketing solicitation from us, including email, direct mail, and phone solicitations, by calling us at 1.888.FICO.EDM (888-342-6336) at any time Monday through Friday. We will not use such personally identifiable information to solicit individuals or businesses without prior consent in those countries that require opt-in consent.

</p>


<p>
<strong>Collecting Personal Information</strong>

We collect <u>Personal Information</u> from applications, questionnaires, and other forms you submit to us, such as your name, contact information (address, email, and telephone number), income, job title, Social Security Number, company's name and location (country, state and zip code), and industry sector. We collect information from your transactions and interactions with us, such as your professional interests.

</p>

<p>

We may collect <u>Personal Information</u> from credit bureaus if it is necessary for the delivery of the services we provide you, and we may access public sources of information, such as census data and real estate records, and private sources of information such as market research data. Note: this Web site  may be hosted by a third party service provider on servers located in the United States. If you are located in a non-US jurisdiction, you may be sending your <u>Personal Information</u> to the United States or another jurisdiction that does not have laws that provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home country.  

</p>

<p>

  When you visit this Web site we may collect and store, either directly or through the use of a third party tracking system, the IP address of the computer making the request (this may not be the IP address of your personal computer, but the IP address assigned to your Internet connection by your Internet service provider or company network); the URL that is being requested; the date and time of the request; the browser type and operating system used to make the request; and the referring URL. We also may collect aggregate search terms from search engine referrals to determine what information visitors are searching for when they find our Web Sites.

</p>

<p style="padding-left:60px">

  <u>Cookies</u>.  We may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to track your use of our Web sites. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so the information can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server to maintain an active "session" with an individual user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information about you, such as your origination information and your product and service preferences. We use cookies to store these identifiers, which allow us to authenticate you when you visit the Web site. These identifiers also allow us to  personalize and facilitate delivery of our products and services to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by this Web site but does not cover the use of cookies by our third-party tracking service.

</p>



<p style="padding-left:60px">

  <u>Web Beacons</u>.  Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. We use web beacons to improve your experience on our Web Sites, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers. Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).

</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px">

  <u>Decline Cookies</u>.  Your Web browser may be set to accept cookies automatically, but can be changed to decline them.  The Help section of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to set your browser to prevent accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Please note that if you decline to accept cookies, the functionality of myFICO and Free FICO Score Web sites will be very limited: you will not be able to log into your account or purchase products.

To financial service providers such as credit bureaus, insurance companies who help us market our products, including business partners in joint marketing agreements (CA residents: we will not disclose information about you to other financial service providers in joint marketing agreements, other than as required by law, unless you authorize us to do so), provided such parties maintain the security and confidentiality of the <i>Personal Information</i>, and process the data in accordance with our instructions;

</li>

</li>

</ul>


<p>
<strong>

Your Opt-Out Choices

</strong>


With respect to <i>Personal Information</i>, you have the ability to opt out of certain types of information sharing and communications. You may tell us not to:

</p>

<ul style="padding-left:60px">

<li>

Disclose information about you outside our corporate group of companies, except we may disclose information as required or permitted by law. Required disclosures are made, for example, to outside auditors and banking regulators. Permitted disclosures are made, for example, to vendors assisting us in opening, maintaining or servicing your account. (CA, ND, and VT Residents: We will not disclose information about you outside our corporate group of companies, other than as required or permitted by law, unless you authorize us to do so.) You may opt out of our disclosing this information by emailing <a href="mailto:SharingOptOut@FICO.com">SharingOptOut@FICO.com</a>.

</li>&nbsp;

<li>

Disclose credit data (i.e., financial data we get from credit bureaus or from you that helps us determine your eligibility for credit) about you within our corporate group of companies; we do not disclose credit data outside our corporate group of companies. (VT Residents: We will not disclose credit information about you within our corporate group of companies, other than as required or permitted by law, unless you authorize us to do so.) You may opt out of our disclosing this information by emailing <a href="mailto:SharingOptOut@FICO.com">SharingOptOut@FICO.com</a>.

</li>&nbsp;

<li>

Solicit you by mail, telephone or e-mail for products and services that are not directly related to your account and that are outside our regular communications with you (such as your monthly statement, customer service e-mails or when you call our customer service center). If you tell us not to solicit you, we will not disclose information about you within our corporate group of companies for that purpose. You may opt out of receiving these communications and information when you create your myFICO® and/or free FICO score account by following the instruction for opting out of the communication programs. You may also opt out at any time by logging into your account at <a id="ctl00_cphMainContent_lnk3" href="http://www.myfico.com/">www.myFICO.com</a> and/or <a href="http://www.FreeFICOScore.com" id="ctl00_cphMainContent_aFFFLink" target="_blank">www.FreeFICOScore.com</a>, clicking on "Contact Preferences", and editing your preferences to opt out of the communication programs. If you receive an email from us you may opt out of further email communications by following the opt-out link contained in the email. (NV residents: you may also contact the Attorney General at 100 N Carson St. Carson City, NV 89701-4717 or by telephone at 775-684-1100.)

</li>

</ul>


<p>

Please note that your decision to opt out will not apply to certain disclosures that are required for us to deliver the Products you have ordered or that are specifically permitted or required by law. For example, the Products cannot operate unless we transmit data to companies that help us provide the Products, such as by providing us with credit reports or processing credit card charges. Your general opt-out instructions also will not apply to specific disclosures or communications to which you consent.

</p>


<p>

<strong>

Personal Data Security and Confidentiality

</strong>


We have up-to-date physical safeguards, such as secure areas in buildings; electronic safeguards, such as passwords, internal and external firewalls, and encryption; and procedural safeguards, such as customer authentication procedures to prevent ID theft. Information you provide to us when you register for and order our products is transmitted to us through a secure sockets layer (SSL) transmission. We restrict access to information about you to only those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We carefully select and monitor outside service providers, such as mail vendors, who have access to customer information, and we require them to keep it safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share the information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do. We train our employees on these security procedures, and we conduct regular audits to check on compliance with the procedures.  Of course, you must do your part to ensure the security of your information. For example, you must guard your logon ID and password and not permit unauthorized use of your account. No security measures can provide absolute protection of data, but we will strive to provide a superior level of protection for your information.

</p>

<p style="padding-left:60px">

<u>Info Vault.</u>  Information you enter in the InfoVault feature of the Suze Orman FICO® Kit is 
treated differently from other information we may collect from you.  The InfoVault is intended for you 
to store private information, including personally identifiable data regarding your accounts, contact 
information, social security number, medical records, and other sensitive information that you decide 
to store there. That information will be available to you on our site as long as your Suze Orman FICO® 
Kit is active.  It is your <i>personal information</i> and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Privacy Policy, FICO will not use this information in any way or intentionally disclose it to any 
third party without your consent or as required by law.  However, we recommend that you be extremely 
careful about the information you decide to store in the InfoVault. 

</p>

<p style="padding-left:60px">

<u>FICO® Forums.</u> If you choose to use the forum on this Web site, any  information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

</p>
