Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

MyFemdomClips allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the MyFemdomClips Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the MyFemdomClips Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

MyFemdomClips does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks MyFemdomClips to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. MyFemdomClips’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
