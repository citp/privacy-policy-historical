We collect and store the following information:

Information collected and stored will generally include your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, your occupation, financial information and statements including details about your income and assets, trading history, copies of government issued identification including your passport and driving license (which contain a photo of you), copies of bills, and copies of residency cards.

### Information about payments

If you use our Services for purchases or financial transactions (like when you fund your account, withdraw money from your account or purchase an app or development services), we collect and store information about the purchase or transaction. This includes your payment information, such as your card information including your credit or debit card number, and your account number including your account number and other authentication details.
