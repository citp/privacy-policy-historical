<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our affiliates.&nbsp; This information does not identify individual users.&nbsp; For example, we may tell an affiliate the gender distribution of our membership.<br>
<br>
We may also publish analyses of the data collected on our Web site.&nbsp; For example, we may display a graph showing the average weight loss of our members over time.&nbsp; These analyses will not contain any personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personally identifiable information:</strong><br>
We only share Personally Identifiable Information when required to complete your order.&nbsp; For example, we send your billing information to our credit card processor.&nbsp; If we are shipping a package, we will provide your postal address to our shipping company.<br>
<br>
We will not sell or distribute your personal information to third parties when not required to complete your order.<br>
<br>
<strong>Agents</strong><br>
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.&nbsp; These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>

<br>
<!-- <h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication.<br />
<br />
<br /> -->
<h3>Log Files</h3>
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br>
<br>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.<br>
<br>
In addition, we record your IP address with your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We do so to help protect ourselves and our members from abusive users of our site.<br>
<br>
We use third-party tracking services that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.&nbsp; We do so in order to track our return on marketing initiatives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.<br>
<br>
We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser or when you have been inactive for 20 minutes or longer.&nbsp; If you reject session cookies, you will not be able to use the members' section of our site.<br>
<br>
Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.&nbsp; If you select the "remember me" option when logging into our members' section, a persistent cookie will be used to allow you to bypass the log in process in the future.&nbsp; We also use persistent cookies to help us track how new members find our site.&nbsp; You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by MyFoodDiary.com or Aligned Web Solutions, Inc.&nbsp; Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Discussion Forum</h3>
If you use the discussion forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of the forum, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update it by making changes on the My Account page in the members' section of our site.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%">The security of your personal information is important to us.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our membership or order forms, we encrypt that information using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</td><td><img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="10" height="1"></td><td valign="top"><!-- GeoTrust QuickSSL [tm] Smart Icon tag. Do not edit. -->
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="//smarticon.geotrust.com/si.js"></script>
<!-- end GeoTrust Smart Icon tag --></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%">In addition to the encryption technology that we employ, we also participate in a daily security audit system provided by ScanAlert.&nbsp; ScanAlert monitors our system for any known vulnerabilities and alerts us to the problem immediately.</td><td><img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="10" height="1"></td><td valign="top"><!--- START SCANALERT CODE --->
<a target="_blank" href="//verify.hackersafe.com/RatingVerify?ref=www.myfooddiary.com"><img width="94" height="54" border="0" src="//images.scanalert.com/meter/www.myfooddiary.com/13.gif" alt="HACKER SAFE certified sites prevent over 99% of hacker crime." oncontextmenu="alert('Copying Prohibited by Law - HACKER SAFE  is a Trademark of ScanAlert'); return false;"></a>
<!--- END   SCANALERT CODE ---></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
In addition to the above precautions, we also remove your credit card number the moment it is received and approved by our credit card processor.&nbsp; This process typically takes milliseconds.&nbsp; This practice means that if a hacker were able to compromise our system, he would not be able to gain access to your credit card number.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
In the event MyFoodDiary.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.&nbsp; You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h3>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.<br>  
<br>
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.&nbsp; If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by means of a notice on our home page.<br>
