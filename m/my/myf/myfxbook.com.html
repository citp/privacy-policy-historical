    <b>What is personal information?</b><br>
    Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable
    natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name,
    an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
    physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can
    no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or
    otherwise.

    We collect personal information from you when you use our Services.

    the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take when using our Services, within our advertising

</p>
<br>
<p>
    We use Google Analytics which is a web analyzing tool of Google Inc. for the purposes of the adequate design and

    A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file
    is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow
    web applications to respond to you. As an individual the web application can tailor its operations to your needs,
    likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.<br>

<br>
<p>
    <b>How we might share your personal information</b><br>
    We may disclose your personal information to other separate services within the Myfxbook corporate group or to third
    parties. This disclosure may be required for us to provide you access to our Services, to comply with our legal
    obligations, to enforce our Terms of Service, to facilitate our marketing and advertising activities, or to prevent,
    detect, mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities related to our Services. We attempt to minimize
    the amount of personal information we disclose to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the
    specified purpose. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties for their
    marketing and advertising purposes without your consent.<br>
    In the event that Myfxbook is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, in any of these
    circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition,
    sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
    or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors'
    rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or used.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>How long we keep your personal information</b><br>
    We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested, or for
    other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our
    policies.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>How do we protect your personal information</b><br>
    We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
    alteration, or destruction. Furthermore, our employees and third party service providers have access to your
    non-public personal information only on a "need to know" basis.
    We follow industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once
    we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
    Therefore, while we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
    absolute security.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Links to other websites</b><br>
    Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used
    these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore,
    we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such
    sites. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Contests </b><br>
    If you choose to enroll to a trading contest, you acknowledge that the contest registration is with the sponsoring
    broker and the information you provide at contest registration will be shared with the broker for account
    opening.<br>
    Contest accounts cannot be deleted or made private during or after the contest has ended.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>AutoTrade</b><br>
    If you choose to enroll to AutoTrade as a provider, you agree to keep your account public at all times. Even if the
    account stops participating in AutoTrade, it will remain as a public record.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Miscellaneous</b><br>
    In the event that any provision of this Privacy Policy is held unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the
    remaining provisions will not be affected, and the unenforceable provision will be replaced with an enforceable
    provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
