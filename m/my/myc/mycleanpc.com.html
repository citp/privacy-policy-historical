        <div>
          <p>CyberDefender Corporation ("CyberDefender") has adopted this Privacy   Policy (the "Policy") to address customers' concerns about privacy and   personal information.  It applies both to personal identifying   information and to other information.  Personal identifying information   ("PII") is information that is recorded in any form, is about you or   pertains to you, and can be connected to you.  It includes your name,   telephone number, email address, billing address, driver's license   number, credit card account information, and social security number.    CyberDefender maintains the confidentiality of your PII and only   CyberDefender and certain persons and entities working for and with   CyberDefender to conduct business with you have access to it.  Other   information, which is described in more detail below, is information   that cannot reasonably be used to identify you, and may be provided by   CyberDefender to others for limited purposes.</p>
          <p>You may find it helpful to compare our Policy with guidelines   issued by organizations such as TRUSTe. TRUSTe is an independent,   non-profit organization whose stated mission is to build users' trust   and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information   practices. CyberDefender is not a licensee of TRUSTe's privacy program,   but we are committed to complying with TRUSTe's guidelines.</p>
          <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding the Policy, please   contact the CyberDefender.com Privacy Information Department by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@CyberDefender.com" target="_blank">privacy@cyberdefender.com</a>,   by calling (888) 427-9359, or by sending a letter to the   CyberDefender.com Privacy Information Department at 617 West 7th Street,   Suite 1000, Los Angeles, CA 90017.</p>
          <p>CyberDefender voluntarily complies with the requirements of the   Safe Harbor framework in connection with the transfer to the United   States of PII from countries which are members of the European Union   ("EU").  As a result, PII provided by residents of countries which are   members of the EU will be subject to the Safe Harbor Principles   published by the United States Department of Commerce ("the Safe Harbor   Principles").  The Principles can be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
          <p>The Policy describes the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The PII you provide in connection with your purchase of CyberDefender licenses, products and services</li>
            <li>Other information we collect as the result of your use of the CyberDefender websites, including <a href="http://www.cyberdefender.com" target="_blank">www.cyberdefender.com</a>, <a href="http://www.spywarefordummies.com" target="_blank">www.spywarefordummies.com</a>, <a href="http://www.maxmyspeed.com" target="_blank">www.maxmyspeed.com</a>, <a href="http://www.doublemyspeed.com" target="_blank">www.doublemyspeed.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.mycleanpc.com" target="_blank">www.mycleanpc.com</a> (collectively, "the Websites")</li>
            <li>How we use the information we collect</li>
            <li>How and with whom we share the information</li>
            <li>How you can opt in or opt out of information collection</li>
            <li>Your ability to access, correct, update and delete your PII</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h1>The Information We Collect</h1>
          <h2>PII</h2>

          <h2><strong>Our Use of the Information We Collect</strong></h2>
          <p>CyberDefender uses the information we collect from you to conduct   business with you and to understand your interests and requirements so   that we can provide the products and services you want.  Specifically,   we use your PII in connection with fulfillment of orders, to complete   payments made by you with your credit or debit card; to manage your   account, to renew your subscription(s), to make offers and promotions,   to provide information about our products and services that we believe   will be important to you, and to help us address any concerns you may   have about our products and services. We use your credit or debit card   account or electronic funds transfer information only for payment   processing and fraud protection, and not for any other purpose.</p>
          <p>We employ contractors in our business, including persons who work   from time to time in our call centers. The contractors may collect PII   from you in the same manner and to the same extent that CyberDefender   collects PII from you.  The contractors are required, pursuant to   agreements they enter into with us, to maintain the security and   confidentiality of your PII.</p>
          <p>We have business relationships with certain entities that provide   services in connection with our business, such as credit and debit card   payment processing, and that require access to your PII.  Your PII will   be provided to them in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy   Policy unless we, or they, inform you otherwise and obtain your consent.    It is possible that they may provide to CyberDefender certain PII   relating to you.  In that event, we will handle the PII in accordance   with the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>
          <p>We also provide certain information to advertisers and marketers.   The information we provide is aggregated before we provide it to   advertisers and marketers, and it does not include PII.</p>
          <p>If you provide us with your email address when you register as a   customer or make a purchase from us, and you do not opt out, we   occasionally may send you email with information, recommendations and   promotional information about our products and services.  At the time   you register or make a purchase, you will be given the opportunity to   opt into or opt out of this service. If you do not initially choose to   opt out, you may still block certain emails from us simply by following   the "unsubscribe" instructions that accompany all communications.   In   addition, we send service and notifications by email to keep you   informed about the status of your service orders and account, and to   provide updates and technical notices.  Some of these communications are   required by law, such as communications regarding the automatic renewal   of licenses and services you have purchased.  Other communications are   essential to the management of your account and the continuing   functionality of our products and services, and therefore an opt-out   option is not available and the communications cannot be blocked.</p>
          <h2><strong>Your Consent</strong></h2>
          <p>By purchasing our licenses and services, and by visiting our   Websites, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your PII   and other information by CyberDefender, its officers, directors, and   employees, and CyberDefender's agents and contractors, as set forth in   this Policy. </p>
          <p>The following applies to residents of countries which are members   of the European Union ("EU") and other countries.  Your PII will be   transferred outside the EU and outside the country of your residence,   and will be examined, processed and stored in the United States.  As a   result, third parties, including governments, courts and law enforcement   and regulatory agencies, may be able to gain access to your PII under   applicable United States laws.  By purchasing our licenses, products and   services, and by visiting our Websites, you consent to the transfer of   your PII outside the EU and your country of residence.</p>
          <h2><strong>Links</strong></h2>
          <p>CyberDefender's Websites contain links to other websites that are   not owned, operated or controlled by CyberDefender.  The links are   provided solely for your convenience, and CyberDefender does not endorse   the websites or their content.   As a result, CyberDefender is not   responsible for the manner in which the websites are operated or for the   information they provide.  It is important to read carefully the   privacy policies of the websites, because they may differ materially   from ours.</p>
          <p>Cookies are unique text files that websites can send to browser   software.  CyberDefender uses cookies to identify customers and   personalize web pages when customers visit our Websites, to record   customers' preferences, and to allow us to consider customers' interests   and requirements in connection with developing and offering our   products and services.  CyberDefender also may use cookies to monitor   your visits to our Websites in order to collect aggregate information   which is not PII.  In addition, cookies enable returning visitors to   visit our Websites without providing their email addresses and passwords   in connection with every visit. </p>
          <p>The information we collect with cookies is not sold,   rented, or shared with any third parties, and is used solely for   analytical purposes.  Because of the manner in which we conduct our   business, we cannot provide subscription services to potential customers   who do not consent our use of cookies or whose browsers are set to   reject cookies.</p>
          <p>CyberDefender also maintains log files of visitors to our Websites.   Log files allow us to manage traffic to our Websites in order that we   may provide reliable service to customers and   		visitors.</p>
          <p>The information gathered by means of cookies and log files – your   Internet address, the Internet address from which you visited our   Websites, your browser type, and information about the length of time   you devoted to visiting our Websites – is aggregate information and does   not include PII.</p>
          <h2><strong>Your Comments and Suggestions</strong></h2>
          <p>We solicit customers' comments and suggestions about our products   and services and, on occasion, we use that information to develop   customer's testimonials that we use in connection with our advertising   and marketing.  Testimonials are developed only after we have obtained   permission of the person providing the information. </p>
          <h2><strong>Accessing, Correcting and Updating Your Information</strong></h2>
          <p>You can access, update or correct your information by contacting CyberDefender Privacy Information Department at <a href="mailto:privacy@CyberDefender.com" target="_blank">privacy@cyberdefender.com</a></p>
          <h2><strong>Information Security</strong></h2>
          <p>All information gathered on our Websites is stored and maintained   in secure facilities and access is limited to authorized personnel.  Our   Websites regularly are subjected to security tests, and we make our   best efforts to attempt to ensure that all information collected is   secure.  PII is protected during communication by HTTPS and SSL   security. Credit and debit card account information has multiple layers   of security, including encryption in storage and SSL during   communication.</p>
          <p>It is not possible to eliminate fully security risks associated   with electronic communications.  In the event that CyberDefender learns   of a breach of security that involves your PII, CyberDefender will   notify you as required pursuant to applicable law.</p>
          <h2><strong>Retention of Information</strong></h2>
          <p>CyberDefender retains your PII for as long as you are a registered   subscriber or user of our products and services, and for a reasonable   time thereafter.</p>
          <h2><strong>Confidentiality</strong></h2>
          <p>CyberDefender maintains the confidentiality of your PII and other   information and will not disclose it to third parties except as set   forth in this Policy.  However, confidentiality does not apply to   information: (1) that is publicly available; (2) as to which you consent   to disclosure; (3) when disclosure is in connection with the sale of   all or part of our business; or (4) when disclosure is necessary for   CyberDefender or its officers, directors, employees, agents and   contractors to enforce their legal rights pursuant to applicable law.</p>
          <p>In addition, CyberDefender reserves the right, in its   sole and absolute discretion, at any time, and without notice, to you to   disclose to third parties, including law enforcement authorities, any   of your information, including PII, that CyberDefender deems appropriate   to: (a) comply with any applicable law or regulation, legal process, or   governmental request; or (b) prevent possible harm or injury to any   person or damage to any property.</p>
          <h2><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></h2>
          <p>If we make material (non-editorial) changes to the Policy, we will post information about the changes on our Websites.</p>
          <h2><strong>The Better Business Bureau Code of Business Conduct</strong></h2>
