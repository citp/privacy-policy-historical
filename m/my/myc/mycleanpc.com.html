        <div>
          <p>USTechSupport  Corporation ("USTechSupport") has adopted this Privacy Policy (the  "Policy") to address customers' concerns about privacy and personal  information. It applies both to personal identifying information and to other  information. Personal identifying information ("PII") is information  that is recorded in any form, is about you or pertains to you, and can be  connected to you. It includes your name, telephone number, email address,  billing address, driver's license number, credit card account information, and  social security number. USTechSupport maintains the confidentiality of your PII  and only USTechSupport and certain persons and entities working for and with USTechSupport  to conduct business with you have access to it. Other information, which is  described in more detail below, is information that cannot reasonably be used  to identify you, and may be provided by USTechSupport to others for limited  purposes.</p>
          <p>You may find it helpful  to compare our Policy with guidelines issued by organizations such as TRUSTe.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose stated mission is to  build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair  information practices. USTechSupport is not a licensee of TRUSTe's privacy  program, but we are committed to complying with TRUSTe's guidelines.</p>
          <p><br>
            If you have questions or  concerns regarding the Policy, please contact the USTechSupport.com Privacy  Information Department by emailing<a href="mailto:privacy@USTechSupport.com" target="_blank"> privacy@ustechsupport.com</a>, by calling (888) 427-9359, or by sending a letter to the USTechSupport.com  Privacy Information Department at 3340 Ocean Park Blvd. Suite 1060 , Santa  Monica, CA 90405.</p>
          <p>USTechSupport  voluntarily complies with the requirements of the Safe Harbor framework in  connection with the transfer to the United States of PII from countries which  are members of the European Union ("EU"). As a result, PII provided  by residents of countries which are members of the EU will be subject to the  Safe Harbor Principles published by the United States Department of Commerce  ("the Safe Harbor Principles"). The Principles can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
          <p>The Policy describes the  following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The PII you provide in  connection with your purchase of USTechSupport licenses, products and services</li>
            <li>Other information we  collect as the result of your use of the USTechSupport websites,  including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ustechsupport.com">www.ustechsupport.com</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberdefender.com/" target="_blank">www.cyberdefender.com</a>, <a href="http://www.spywarefordummies.com/" target="_blank">www.spywarefordummies.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maxmyspeed.com/" target="_blank">www.maxmyspeed.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doublemyspeed.com/" target="_blank">www.doublemyspeed.com</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mycleanpc.com/" target="_blank">www.mycleanpc.com</a>&nbsp;(collectively, "the Websites")</li>

            <li>How and with whom we  share the information</li>
            <li>How you can opt in or  opt out of information collection</li>
            <li>Your ability to access,  correct, update and delete your PII</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The  Information We Collect</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>PII</strong><br>

          <p><strong>Other  Information</strong><br>
          We also collect other  information from you when you communicate with us electronically. Like many websites,  we use "cookies" to obtain certain information when your Web browser  accesses our Websites. Our Websites also automatically receive and record on  our server logs information from your browser. More information about our use  of cookies and log files appears below.</p>
          <p>The information gathered  by means of cookies and log files consists of your Internet address (Internet  Protocol Address), a referring URL (the web site that you to visit our  Websites), your browser type, and information about the length of time you  devoted to visiting our Websites.

          <p><br>
            We also may collect  (with your authorization) the following information about your computer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Technical information  about the basic configuration and operation of your computer, including  operating system version, processor type, disk space, memory space, and number  of drivers</li>
            <li>Information about USTechSupport  Software on your computer, including the version and when it was installed and  upgraded</li>

By way of explanation, although USTechSupport  knows, based on the information, that there is a customer with a certain kind  of computer that is performing certain functions, USTechSupport does not know  the customer's identity. In the event that it is necessary for USTechSupport to  learn your identity in order to diagnose certain kinds of problems or to  monitor your computer for certain events, you will be asked to authorize USTechSupport  to collect the additional information. You can make your selection as to  whether USTechSupport may collect this additional information before the  software is installed or buy using a control panel included in the software.  You can change your selection concerning this feature by using the control  panel.</p>
          <p><br>
            We do not sell or  otherwise provide any of this information to third parties and use it only to  improve our products and offer better service to our customers.</p>
          <p>For a complete list of  the information we may collect, click&nbsp;<a href="client-info-list.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p>In order to personalize  our communications with you and to improve our products and services, we also  may ask you to provide consumer satisfaction information and other information  regarding your personal and professional interests, your experience with our  products and services, and additional contact information. You have the option  of choosing not to provide the information.</p>
          <p><strong>Our  Use of the Information We Collect</strong><br>
          USTechSupport uses the  information we collect from you to conduct business with you and to understand  your interests and requirements so that we can provide the products and  services you want. Specifically, we use your PII in connection with fulfillment  of orders, to complete payments made by you with your credit or debit card; to  manage your account, to renew your subscription(s), to make offers and  promotions, to provide information about our products and services that we  believe will be important to you, and to help us address any concerns you may  have about our products and services. We use your credit or debit card account  or electronic funds transfer information only for payment processing and fraud  protection, and not for any other purpose.</p>
          <p>We employ contractors in  our business, including persons who work from time to time in our call centers.  The contractors may collect PII from you in the same manner and to the same  extent that USTechSupport collects PII from you. The contractors are required,  pursuant to agreements they enter into with us, to maintain the security and  confidentiality of your PII.</p>
          <p>We have business  relationships with certain entities that provide services in connection with  our business, such as credit and debit card payment processing, and that  require access to your PII. Your PII will be provided to them in accordance  with the provisions of this Privacy Policy unless we, or they, inform you  otherwise and obtain your consent. It is possible that they may provide to USTechSupport  certain PII relating to you. In that event, we will handle the PII in  accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>We also provide certain  information to advertisers and marketers. The information we provide is  aggregated before we provide it to advertisers and marketers, and it does not  include PII.</p>
          <p>If you provide us with  your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us,  and you do not opt out, we occasionally may send you email with information,  recommendations and promotional information about our products and services. At  the time you register or make a purchase, you will be given the opportunity to  opt into or opt out of this service. If you do not initially choose to opt out,  you may still block certain emails from us simply by following the  "unsubscribe" instructions that accompany all communications. In  addition, we send service and notifications by email to keep you informed about  the status of your service orders and account, and to provide updates and  technical notices. Some of these communications are required by law, such as  communications regarding the automatic renewal of licenses and services you  have purchased. Other communications are essential to the management of your  account and the continuing functionality of our products and services, and  therefore an opt-out option is not available and the communications cannot be  blocked.</p>
          <p><strong>Your  Consent</strong><br>
          By purchasing our  licenses and services, and by visiting our Websites, you consent to the  collection, use and disclosure of your PII and other information by USTechSupport,  its officers, directors, and employees, and USTechSupport's agents and  contractors, as set forth in this Policy.</p>
          <p>The following applies to  residents of countries which are members of the European Union ("EU")  and other countries. Your PII will be transferred outside the EU and outside  the country of your residence, and will be examined, processed and stored in  the United States. As a result, third parties, including governments, courts  and law enforcement and regulatory agencies, may be able to gain access to your  PII under applicable United States laws. By purchasing our licenses, products  and services, and by visiting our Websites, you consent to the transfer of your  PII outside the EU and your country of residence.</p>
          <p><strong>Links</strong><br>
          USTechSupport's Websites  contain links to other websites that are not owned, operated or controlled by USTechSupport.  The links are provided solely for your convenience, and USTechSupport does not  endorse the websites or their content. As a result, USTechSupport is not  responsible for the manner in which the websites are operated or for the  information they provide. It is important to read carefully the privacy  policies of the websites, because they may differ materially from ours.</p>
          <p>Cookies are unique text  files that websites can send to browser software. USTechSupport uses cookies to  identify customers and personalize web pages when customers visit our Websites,  to record customers' preferences, and to allow us to consider customers'  interests and requirements in connection with developing and offering our  products and services. USTechSupport also may use cookies to monitor your  visits to our Websites in order to collect aggregate information which is not  PII. In addition, cookies enable returning visitors to visit our Websites  without providing their email addresses and passwords in connection with every  visit.</p>
          <p><strong><em>The information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or  shared with any third parties, and is used solely for analytical purposes.  Because of the manner in which we conduct our business, we cannot provide  subscription services to potential customers who do not consent our use of  cookies or whose browsers are set to reject cookies.</em></strong></p>
          <p>USTechSupport also  maintains log files of visitors to our Websites. Log files allow us to manage  traffic to our Websites in order that we may provide reliable service to customers  and visitors.</p>

          <p><strong>Your  Comments and Suggestions</strong><br>
          We solicit customers'  comments and suggestions about our products and services and, on occasion, we  use that information to develop customer's testimonials that we use in  connection with our advertising and marketing. Testimonials are developed only  after we have obtained permission of the person providing the information.</p>
          <p><strong>Accessing,  Correcting and Updating Your Information</strong><br>
          You can access, update  or correct your information by contacting USTechSupport Privacy Information  Department at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@ustechsupport.com" target="_blank">privacy@ustechsupport.com</a></p>
          <p><strong>Information  Security</strong><br>
          All information gathered  on our Websites is stored and maintained in secure facilities and access is  limited to authorized personnel. Our Websites regularly are subjected to  security tests, and we make our best efforts to attempt to ensure that all  information collected is secure. PII is protected during communication by HTTPS  and SSL security. Credit and debit card account information has multiple layers  of security, including encryption in storage and SSL during communication. It  is not possible to eliminate fully security risks associated with electronic  communications. In the event that USTechSupport learns of a breach of security  that involves your PII, USTechSupport will notify you as required pursuant to  applicable law.</p>
          <p><strong>Retention  of Information</strong><br>
          USTechSupport retains  your PII for as long as you are a registered subscriber or user of our products  and services, and for a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
          <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
          USTechSupport maintains  the confidentiality of your PII and other information and will not disclose it  to third parties except as set forth in this Policy. However, confidentiality  does not apply to information: (1) that is publicly available; (2) as to which  you consent to disclosure; (3) when disclosure is in connection with the sale  of all or part of our business; or (4) when disclosure is necessary for USTechSupport  or its officers, directors, employees, agents and contractors to enforce their  legal rights pursuant to applicable law.</p>
          <p><strong><em>In addition, USTechSupport reserves the right, in its sole and  absolute discretion, at any time, and without notice, to you to disclose to  third parties, including law enforcement authorities, any of your information,  including PII, that USTechSupport deems appropriate to: (a) comply with any  applicable law or regulation, legal process, or governmental request; or (b)  prevent possible harm or injury to any person or damage to any property.</em></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Notification  of Changes</strong><br>
          If we make material  (non-editorial) changes to the Policy, we will post information about the changes  on our Websites.</p>
