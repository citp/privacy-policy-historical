              <section class="content">
                <p>
                  We collect personally identifiable information about you via our Website when you provide it through various forms and places on the Website, such as when you provide it in order to open an account with us or purchase software licenses and technical support services from us.  You may browse our Website without providing any personal information; however if, for example, you decide to purchase technical support, we will ask you for your name, age, the password to your computer in the event you purchase certain technical support services, billing address, phone number(s), email address, and payment information such as credit/debit card number, expiration dates, PayPal or third party payment information. Also, to the extent we offer identity protection services (if ever) and you purchase them, USTechSupport may need to collect your social security number.  If you choose to complete a user registration form, survey, we may ask you for personal information, such as your contact information (<em>e.g.</em>, name, e-mail address and mailing address). Occasionally, we may also ask you for other demographic information, such as gender, income level, and information about your prior experiences with the USTechSupport's products.  If we combine demographic information with the personal information we collect directly from you on our Website, we will treat the combined data as personal information under this Privacy Policy.  When you submit your personally identifiable or demographic information on one of the Website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Website, such as when they submit your information to us about you.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Website with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.  You may delete the other person's information from your account or the other person may contact us at <a href="mailto:support2@ustechsupport.com">support2@ustechsupport.com</a> to request that we remove their information from our database.  Note: Although you can remove the information from your account for future orders, the other person's information may be retained with the original transaction for auditing and legal purposes.  In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also use the tracking technologies described in Section 5 below in order to automatically (or passively) collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular and remembering you and your preferences, your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier, device functionality (including browser, operator system, hardware, mobile network information), device location, device characteristics, city, time zone, MAC address, referring and exit URL and similar information.  Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal and other business purposes, such as generating statistics, developing marketing plans, customizing content, tailoring our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others and improving the Website.  This usage information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device whenever you visit or interact with our Website.  We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, partners and other third parties.  We may combine automatically collected Website usage information with your personal information. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we provide technical support services to you, we also may collect (in some instances with your authorization first), the following information about your computer or other device:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Technical information about the basic configuration and operation of your computer, including operating system version, processor type, disk space, memory space, and number of drivers;</li>
                  <li>Information about USTechSupport software on your computer, including the version and when it was installed and upgraded; and</li>
                  <li>Certain events that occur on your computer, including when USTechSupport software is installed, when USTechSupport software receives threat updates, and when errors occur in USTechSupport software.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This information collected as part of our provision of technical support services to you is sent only to USTechSupport when you reach out to us for assistance, and it is stored in an anonymous form that cannot be used to identify you.  By way of explanation, although USTechSupport knows, based on the information, that there is a customer with a certain kind of computer that is performing certain functions, USTechSupport, does not know the customer's identity unless you tell it to us.  In the event that it is necessary for USTechSupport to learn your identity in order to diagnose certain kinds of problems or to monitor your computer for certain events, you will be asked to authorize USTechSupport to collect the additional information.  You can make your selection as to whether USTechSupport may collect this additional information before the software is installed or buy using a control panel included in the software.  You can change your selection concerning this feature by using the control panel.

                  The Website is intended for a general audience.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us, please contact Customer Service using the contact information in Section 14 below.

Please note, however, that although we employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard the security of your personal information, no transmissions made on or through the Internet are guaranteed to be secure.

                <p>
                  Some web browsers are developing or offering signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (<em>e.g.</em>, a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal).  A DNT signal is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking.  We do not monitor or take any action with respect to DNT signals.

              <section class="content">
                <p>
                  We may work with third parties, such as network advertisers and ad exchanges that use tracking technologies on our Website in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and/or on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet and we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities (including past visits to our Website) across the Internet and mobile media ("Behavioral Ads").  Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested.  If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.  Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your device and track certain behavioral usage information via a device identifier.  These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") website at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>).  Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options or programs.
