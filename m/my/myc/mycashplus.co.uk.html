  <h2>Keep yourself safe online</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never reveal your password to anyone or write it down</li>
  <li>Don’t use a password that could be easily guessed by someone else</li>
  <li>Change your password immediately if you suspect someone else could know it</li>
  <li>Log off when you’ve completed your transaction</li>
  <li>Keep your PC updated with current anti-virus software and the latest browser versions</li>
  <li>Don’t send us any confidential account information by email</li>
  <li>Treat emails you receive with caution. Remember that we'll never ask you to disclose your personal or account information to us by email</li>
  <li>We recommend that you regularly visit the <a href="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk/" title="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk">http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk</a> website to keep up-to-date with tips to protect yourself from the latest scams</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Username and Password</h3>
<p>On registering a Cashplus account with us, you’ll have a username and password which must be used in order to access certain restricted parts of the website. Your username and password are used by us to identify you, so they’re very important. You’re responsible for all information posted on the website by anyone using your username and password. Any breach of security of a username and password should be notified to us immediately.</p>
<p>We recommend you also read our <a href="/customer-help/card-security.aspx" title="Keeping your card safe">guidelines on keeping your Cashplus prepaid Gold MasterCard<sup class="reg">®</sup> safe</a></p>

<a name="our_system_security" title="Our system security"></a>
<h2>Our system security</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our systems operate on 128-bit secure encryption. Look for the yellow padlock symbol in your browser status bar</li>
  <li>A team of independent security experts regularly tests our website
  </li><li>Your session will time out if you don't use your keyboard for more than 15 minutes</li>
  <li>Your Cashplus Account Members' log-in will be locked out after three failed access attempts. You'll need to <a href="/contact-us/default.aspx" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> to reset your account</li>
  <li>We'll verify your identity before disclosing confidential information over the phone or resetting your password</li>
  <li>We don't guarantee the website will be fault free and don't accept liability for any errors or omissions </li>
</ul>
  
<p>
All forms and online account pages, i.e. those pages that show your information, use 128-bit encryption. Encryption makes your information unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. In addition, a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used to connect your browser to our secure servers.
</p>
<p>
The latest browsers support 128-bit encryption. Older browsers (such as Internet explorer 5.0) support lower levels of encryption (40-bit or 56-bit) but they still remain extremely secure. 
</p>

<h3>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h3>
<p>
A "Secure Socket Layer" is a commonly used method of managing the security of messages transmitted across the Internet and is used by us to connect your computer to our secure server. You can tell that SSL is in use if the URL in the search bar starts with https:// or / and a lock icon is displayed on your browser. If you have problems getting to secure mode, install one of the latest browsers and try the website again.
</p>
<h3>Which browser do I need to view this website?</h3>
<p>
Our website has been designed to work with a variety of the latest browsers on either Apple Macintosh computers or Windows based PCs. 
</p>
<p>
If you’re using an older browser you’ll be able to view the information pages, but you may not be able to apply for a card or access your account information. To make an application online we recommend that you upgrade to the latest versions.
</p>
<h3>Need to change your screen resolution?</h3>
<p>
We recommend viewing this website with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or above. 
</p>

<h3>Do you need plug-ins?</h3>
<p>
 "Plug-ins" are additional software programs required by some websites to make them work properly. An example is Flash Player from Adobe. Our website doesn't need any plug-ins to work effectively, however you may need a PDF reader such as <a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/" target="cashplus" title="Adobe Acrobat Reader">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a> to download certain documents.
</p>

<h3>Having difficulty accessing your account from work?</h3>
<p>
Most organisations have what is known as a "firewall" to protect their networks and their computers. A firewall is a secure server through which all communication passes and which protects the organisation's computers from unauthorised access by filtering the information getting in and out. Depending on how the firewall is set up, access to another secure server may be denied.
</p>
<p>
If you’re having problems accessing your account from work but can access it from home with no difficulties, check with your IT department to see if a firewall is in place that may be affecting access to our website and how this has been set up.
</p>

<a name="use_of_email" title="Use of email"></a>
<h2>Use of email</h2>
<p>
Please note that ordinary email is not secure.
</p>
<p>
Please don't send us any confidential information via email. We'll only use email to send you account information, such as your account balance and transaction information or special offers, if you’ve given your consent. We won't use e-mail to send other confidential personal information to you. We can’t accept any responsibility for the unauthorised access by a third party and/or the corruption of data being sent by individuals to APS. It's our policy that if any of our customers are victims of unauthorised access to their accounts, and provided that you have not breached our security procedures, acted fraudulently or without reasonable care, we'll cover any direct financial loss which you may have suffered.
</p>
<p>
We'll never send emails to you requesting security or any other confidential information. Don’t reply to any such emails or disclose any personal information. If you think you’ve received a fraudulent email that's designed to look as if it was sent from us, forward the entire email including the header and footer to <a href="mailto:fraud@apsgroup.com" title="fraud@apsgroup.com">fraud@apsgroup.com</a> then delete it from your email account.

<a name="use_of_cookies" title="Use of cookies"></a>
<h2 id="cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</h2>

<p>APS Group is committed to ensuring that all site visitors' privacy is protected and that they have a positive experience on the APS Group sites. <strong>We use cookies to provide you with the best possible online experience on our website</strong>. However, if you would like to, you can change your cookie settings at any time. APS does not put personal information in our cookies and the majority of cookies are there to support processes and will expire when the browser is closed. Any persistent cookies are to improve user experience.
</p>

<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a text-only string of data, which often includes a random unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.
</p>

<p>
On the APS Group's websites (APS), we may use cookies to record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests and needs. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of APS website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
</p>

<p>
If cookies are enabled then during the course of any visit to an APS' website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are stored to your device. On a repeat visit the APS website may check to see, and find, any cookie left there on the last visit to enable us to present personalised feature. APS might also look at IP addresses to add general information about the country, city or region in which you are located, along with your domain name (e.g. what internet service provider you use)
</p>

<p>There are two types of cookies that may be used across all APS Group websites:</p>

<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Session Cookies</i></p>
<p>
 These are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you close the browser. They enable information to be maintained across pages of our site pursuant to providing you with a better experience. These cookies cannot personally identify you and they will expire when you close down your browser. 
</p>

<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Persistent Cookies</i></p>

<p>
These remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the life time of that specific cookie). These cookies help APS recognise you as a unique visitor (just a randomly generated number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly. On some of our sites, as with session cookies, they also enable information to be maintained across pages of our site and avoid you having to re-enter information.
</p>

<p>
Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. It is important to note that at no time will we or our service providers attempt to identify you individually during your access of our general websites, and at no time do we know who you are or what pages you individually have been looking at - we simply aggregate the relevant information to create the market segments of groups of people. 
</p>

<p>
The exception to this is within our secure websites - our secure banking site (Members Area) and our Online Application site - where we have to securely identify you and track your usage to protect your account. However the cookies themselves do not contain any personal or identifiable information.
</p>

<p style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Google Ad-Preferences</i></p>

<p>Google sets a cookie on your browser that anonymously captures your interests allowing their advertising partners to present products and services on their websites that are relevant to you. Google are in full control of these cookies. You can change your Google Ad-Preferences or find out more about Google Ad-Preferences by visiting: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" target="cashplus" title="Google Ad-Preferences">www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a></p>

<h3>Why does APS use cookies?</h3>

<p>
Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our iAdvance pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight general iAdvance information on your second and subsequent visits.
</p>

<p>
APS group also use a number of independent measurement and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to APS websites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. APS use this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. All third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes and at no time does the information identify you individually. 
</p>

<h3>Third Party Cookies on APS pages</h3>

<p>
Authorised Third Parties serve cookies via our sites, under our direct control. These are used for the following purposes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Control Cookie Settings</h3>

<p>Majority of browsers will have a default 'medium' cookie setting, allowing 1<sup class="diams">st</sup> party cookies but blocking 3<sup class="diams">rd</sup> party cookies. You can change your cookie settings via your browser through the following paths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer: Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Privacy</li>
<li>Firefox: Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy</li>
<li>Google Chrome: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Content Settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>
