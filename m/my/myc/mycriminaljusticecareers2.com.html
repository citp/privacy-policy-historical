        <p>The Privacy Policy below describes the standards we adhere to in handling your personal information.</p>
        <p><b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up ("Consumers") on this website ("Web Site"), and other Renevati
          Inc. owned web sites that point to this site that may or may not be listed in this Privacy Policy. Please note that this
          pledge applies only to sites maintained by Renevati Inc. and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations
          to which we link. We may share the personal information that you supply to us with third party businesses in order to
          complete the request for additional information outlined by the Web Site.  Requests for information will be fulfilled via
          direct mail, email and telemarketing. The third party businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and
          applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing. You can
          browse the Mycriminaljusticecareers2 web site at anytime without revealing any personal information about yourself. There are,
          however, several areas on our web site where we collect personal information from you on a voluntary basis. Personal
          information is information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone
          number that is not otherwise publicly available. This information helps us serve you better by enabling us:</p>
        <p>
          (1) to process and fulfill your requests for products and services<br>
          (2) to solicit your opinions and other feedback<br>
          (3) to conduct research<br>
          (4) to customize the content you see<br>

          (5) to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients</p>

          certain types of information every time you visit us. We use "cookies" and the other information to enhance your experience and
          present you with personalized offers. Likewise, we sometimes use third-party advertising companies to serve and track advertisements
          appearing on our web site These companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information
          that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>
        <p><b>Legal Protection</b><br>
          We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, and will establish or exercise our legal rights and defend
          against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
          regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
          person, violations of Renevati's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p><b>Use and Sharing of PII</b><br>
          Renevati Inc. may share Consumer PII in aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies that wish to reach a particular
          Consumer target audience (e.g., registered female Consumers between the ages of 25-35, who have an average household income
          of over $50,000.00). This information will allow these entities to provide relevant offers to specific Consumers.<br>

          Finally, Renevati Inc. may disclose Consumer PII in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental
          inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect the rights or property of Renevati Inc., the Network Sites
          or other Consumers of this Site.</p>

          company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Renevati
          Inc., including customer account information. The successor company would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy
          unless you consent otherwise.</p>

        <p><b>Cookies and IP Addresses</b><br>

          To serve you more efficiently and effectively, we use "cookies" technology. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's
          hard drive that contains information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information while
          on our site. Once the user closes their browser, a cookie simply terminates. Cookies enable a web site to "personalize" itself
          for each user and reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer. In order to optimize your experience, cookies
          also help with the collection of customer tracking data. We may also capture customer tracking data on some of our partner's
          web sites, realted to activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our web site. This information is used to monitor
          the performance of our partners. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used
          by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
        <p><b>Clear Gifs</b><br>
          We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our
          site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function
          to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personal information.
          We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to
          gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to
          opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from our homepage
