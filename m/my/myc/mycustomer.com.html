<p>The term MyCustomer.com or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the website whose registered office is Bridge House, 48-52 Baldwin Street, Bristol BS1 1QB. Our company registration number is Our company registration number is 05923499 registered in England and Wales. The term "you" refers to the user or viewer of our website.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>We collect information from our users at several different points on the Website - this can be for registration, login, customer service and billing purposes, and also so that we may customise the Website according to individual selections. Sift Media is the sole owner of the personal information collected from this Website.</p>

<p>Your details are never sold or rented to any third parties. However, where your details are requested in order to download documents from our sponsors, you agree that such details will be provided to the sponsor.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>In order to access the full range of content and features on the Website, and also to receive our regular email bulletins, we require users to complete a member registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, email address, and selected information about the company that you work for).</p>

<p>It is optional for the user to provide certain demographic information (such as gender), however we encourage the full completion of the registration form so that we can refine our editorial content and provide a more personalised experience.</p>

<h3>Order forms</h3>
<p>We sometimes may request additional information from users on order forms. Users have to provide contact information (such as name and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfil customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>

<h3><a name="cookies">Cookies</a></h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file written to your hard drive that contains information about your account on this Website. Cookies do not contain any personal information about users. During the course of your visit to this Website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Cookies enable us to collect useful information such as the device a user is using and whether they have visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>

<p><strong>How does MyCustomer use cookies?</strong><br>
Information gathered from cookies helps us to analyse the behaviour of our visitors and their online behaviour and patterns. This means we can provide you with a better community and user experience by tailoring our site to your needs. We are constantly looking for ways in improve our online community and information from cookies is critical for this. </p>

<p>Cookies do not give us any personal information about you or your business. They simply allow us to see which areas of the site are working well i.e. visited most and which content is most of interest.</p>

<p>Cookies also allow you to have a more seamless experience of using the site i.e. you remain logged in for entire sessions or multiple user sessions, removing the need to remember usernames and passwords on a regular basis.

<p>Any widgets we use like Google+, Twitter, FB, Linkedin may also set their own cookies and set their own Google analytics cookies.</p>

<p>You should check the third party websites for more information about these.</p>
