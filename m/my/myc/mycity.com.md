## Cookies & Log Files

Like most web sites, Mycity.com uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Mycity.com to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site. 

One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you've logged in to your Mycity.com account. The next time you visit the Mycity.com web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to login before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number), however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the Mycity.com site you will need to re-enter your login credentials the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Mycity.com site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. 

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Mycity.com web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Mycity.com. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Mycity.com service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law. 

##  Web Beacons

We may allow other companies (although not presently), called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Mycity.com users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Mycity.com may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile - for example, “web designers looking for accountants in Tampa, FL.” These ads may also be promoted within emails sent to each user. 

To deliver these ads properly, Mycity.com may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Mycity.com so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites. 

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. 

These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being an Mycity.com user and Mycity.com never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third party. 

## Children

Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service. 

## Information Use

Mycity.com is a lead generation tool designed to bring professionals together in a more intelligent way. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself and your company to others. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Mycity.com from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by Mycity.com. This information can be utilized by Mycity.com at its sole discretion. 

## Mycity.com Communications

Mycity.com may send you promotional information at any time. 

## Customized Content

Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your experience on the website and app. For example, when you login to your account we may partial information about you and your company on our homepage when people log-in. The intent (obviously) is to provide you with immediate and maximum exposure Mycity.com. Additionally, many users upload third-party logos to their profiles. Mycity.com neither endorses nor is affiliated with most of these third-party companies. In most cases, Mycity.com is not affiliated with these companies. If a company feels the logo placed on a profile is in violation of their trademark guidelines, they should contact the profile owner and/or contact Mycity.com directly to have the logo removed. 

## Sharing Information With Third Parties

Mycity.com takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information. Mycity.com offers a “public profile” as well as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) features which publish portions of user's profiles, including “name” and “company name”, to the public Internet. Users are given the chance to opt-out of this SEO feature through their Account Settings. Mycity.com will also share portions of your contact information (no email or phone) with other members who we have determined to be a good match. The spirit of our website is to connect people more intelligently and efficiently. Simply put, if you do not wish to have your contact information shared with other users, you should not sign-up for Mycity.com. We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry, geographic location, company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users' activities on the site, please email customer service.
