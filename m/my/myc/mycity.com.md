**PRIVACY POLICY FOR MYCITY.COM**   
MyCity.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to better understand our views and practices, and how they pertain to you as a member of MyCity.com's Web service. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to MyCity.com via e-mail at [CustomerCare@mycity.com](mailto:CustomerCare@mycity.com), or by snail mail to: **10559 Jefferson Boulevard, Suite C, Culver City CA 90232**

**What information does the MyCity.com site gather and track?** MyCity.com strives to provide our LOCALS with a superior, personalized and customized Internet experience. To do so, MyCity.com gathers information about each of our members' geographic location, personal interests, and preferences. As part of the MyCity.com registration process, we will ask you to provide individually identifiable information such as your first name, e-mail address, and zip code. As you continue to move throughout the service, additional personalization features will enable you to further customize content areas or topics of specific interest to you. 

We also monitor and catalog traffic patterns throughout the MyCity.com site. We accomplish this through a feature of your browser called a "cookie," which in turn assigns a random number, or "User ID," to your browser. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to isolate the identity of any single user. Your MyCity.com User ID only identifies your computer. Unless you specifically tell us, MyCity.com will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that certain areas of the MyCity.com site will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies. 

Companies, which purchase advertising on the MyCity.com service, also have the ability to assign their cookie to your computer, in a process which MyCity.com does not control. But since cookies aren't able to identify individuals (you'll be just a number to them). 

**How does MyCity.com use this information?** We hope to make MyCity.com the starting point for all your local online needs. More importantly, we want to deliver a compelling online experience that will keep you coming back to visit the service again and again. MyCity.com uses the information supplied to us as a means to personalize portions of the service. Some of these personalized services are made available directly by MyCity.com, while others are offered by our content partners. In addition, we analyze and evaluate member preferences, comments, and criticisms of MyCity.com's offerings in order to make improvements to the present and future versions of the service. 

To help our advertisers better understand our Local's preferences and interests, MyCity.com provides summary or aggregate - not individual - reports on a regular basis. (An example of the type of information provided in a summary report might be, "40,000 people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today and of those people, 50% had previously indicated they were interested in local sports"). MyCity.com's advertisers use this information to determine the effectiveness of their creative and media investments. 

MyCity.com automatically sends all registered Locals an introductory e-mail which confirms the Local's username and password and provides information on contacting MyCity.com's member service and support staff. In addition, at your discretion, we will send you the MyCity.com Newsletter, which provides you with information about new products, services, or special promotions. In every such e-mail, we will also include instructions on how to unsubscribe to future communications of this type. 

MyCity.com reserves the right to share or transfer information to 3rd parties for marketing opportunities, and when required by law. 

**Will MyCity.com disclose any of my personal information?** Individually identifiable information provided to MyCity.com is used throughout the service to provide a personalized experience for our members. We reserve the right to share and transfer data to 3rd parties for marketing opportunities, as well as share data with our content partners. MyCity.com retains no responsibility or liability for privacy policies of our content partners 

Companies that purchase advertising on MyCity.com may track your navigation to and from their sites and collect aggregate information about you when an ad is displayed or when you click on their ads. MyCity.com does not control this collection of information, nor do we monitor the use of this information once our advertisers obtain it. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have questions about their use of this information. Additionally, MyCity.com does not control the information collection and distribution policies on sites outside of the MyCity.com service. 

As part of our community-building tools, MyCity.com allows members to interact and participate in various chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please be aware that any information disclosed in a chat room or news group, or on a message board, becomes public information. Members should exercise serious caution when deciding to disclose individually identifiable information in one of these areas. Your personal privacy is important to us; however, MyCity.com cannot ensure the protection or security of information disclosed within these areas. 

In addition, if you choose to make a purchase through an online store or service linked from MyCity.com, be aware that any information given, such as a credit card number or home address, will be received by the company operating the store. These merchants have separate and distinct privacy and data collection practices. MyCity.com retains no responsibility or liability for the privacy policies of these online stores. To obtain more information about an individual vendor's policy on privacy, please visit their homepage and review their privacy statement before making a purchase decision. 

**What are MyCity.com's opt-out features?** MyCity.com's policy on communications directed to our members is very clear:  
You can tell us if you don't want to receive communication from MyCity.com, such as MyCity.com's e-mail newsletters announcing contests, new features, or offerings from our content partners, when you first provide the information to MyCity.com, or simply by replying to the e-mail with "Unsubscribe" written in the subject line. 

Any modifications to this policy will be posted in this space. We welcome any questions or comments you have; please direct them to [CustomerCare@mycity.com](mailto:CustomerCare@mycity.com). 

**What Is MyCity.com's policy towards children?** MyCity.com takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our services. The MyCity.com site does not knowingly collect information about children and the majority of our site is not specifically directed to children. We believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out any personal information. We encourage you to participate in your child's experience in cyberspace and to review our important safety tips before your child explores the Internet. 

MyCity.com recommends that parents and kids try the "Family" section of the site together. Kids should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to MyCity.com, or to anyone online for that matter.
