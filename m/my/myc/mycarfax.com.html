                <br> CARFAX will collect your name, mailing address, email address, and payment card information when you purchase CARFAX<sup>®</sup> Vehicle History Reports<sup>™</sup> ("CARFAX Reports"). For services offered at no cost to you, such as myCARFAX, CARFAX may require you to provide an email address. CARFAX may also require a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or license plate information to provide the relevant vehicle history information. If you submit a request for information on any CARFAX web sites, CARFAX will collect any information you submit in connection with your request, including but not limited to, name, email address, telephone number, and any personalized message included in your request. In addition, CARFAX may collect other information that you may submit in the course of searching for vehicles such as zip code and/or type of vehicle viewed. If you call a toll-free telephone number provided on any CARFAX web site, CARFAX may record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with other information that may be captured, and all such captured information may be used as described in this Privacy Statement.<p></p>

                <p>CARFAX may also allow you to (1) enter information regarding your vehicle when you use myCARFAX, (2) share feedback related to third party products or services and (3) submit other content or materials through public postings on CARFAX web sites. Please be aware that if you disclose personally identifiable information or other sensitive information through such postings on CARFAX web sites the information will be viewable by others. </p>

                <p>CARFAX web sites may contain <b>web beacons</b> to collect data regarding user traffic patterns. CARFAX web sites use <b>cookies</b> to collect information about your computer hardware (desktop, laptop, mobile devices etc.) and software, including but not limited to, referring domains, the type of browser used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, IP addresses and plug-ins. We may collect, or have a third party collect on our behalf, data on the number of visits, paths taken, time spent on CARFAX web sites, how visitors use and navigate through the CARFAX web sites (examples include, the number of users who visit various pages within the CARFAX web sites, information accessed by such visitors, whether they scroll up or down on particular pages or complete any forms). We may include web beacons in some of our email communications to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns. </p>

                <p>If you choose to participate in CARFAX surveys while on CARFAX web sites you may be asked to provide other anonymous demographic information such as zip code, age, gender, preferences and interests.</p>

                <p><strong><a name="Use">Use of the information </a><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></strong>
                    <br> CARFAX uses the information you provide to deliver services requested by you. As more specifically explained under the heading <a href="#disclose">Disclosure of the information to third parties</a>, if you submit a request for information on any CARFAX web site, you agree that CARFAX may share the information you submit with third parties, as necessary to respond to your request. You may also receive emails from CARFAX offering additional CARFAX products and services and other special offers and promotions related to the used car buying and ownership process. Information related to your vehicle that you submit through myCARFAX may be included in the vehicle history information for that vehicle.</p>

                <p>We use information collected through cookies and web beacons to analyze usage, learn about users and deliver customized content and advertising and uncover ways in which we can improve CARFAX web sites and make them easier to use. Information provided by visitors to the CARFAX web sites who choose to complete user surveys helps us better understand how visitors to the CARFAX web sites are using CARFAX information and develop better products and services for you. CARFAX occasionally appends data collected through CARFAX web sites with third party data to effectively plan customer communications and marketing campaigns and analyze how the CARFAX web sites are used.</p>

                <p><strong><a name="Protect">Protection of the information </a><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></strong>
                    <br> We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards against unauthorized access to the information CARFAX collects. For example, when you complete the CARFAX Report order form, all information you enter is encrypted via a secure sockets layer (SSL) before it is sent over the Internet to our secure servers and/or credit card processor, as applicable. We do not retain the full payment card account number submitted in the process of purchasing a CARFAX Report in our systems, but we may store partial payment card numbers for our reference. To protect against unauthorized access to your account, we recommend that you protect your password, log out of your account and close your browser after each use. </p>

                <p>We may share non-personal, anonymous, statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with our advertisers, service providers or other third parties. We may also disclose information collected through cookies and web beacons to our affiliates or to third parties, who may aggregate such online activity information across multiple web sites and may use such information for predictive advertising, measuring the effectiveness of advertising or for other purposes.
