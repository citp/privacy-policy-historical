### Your Username and Password

On registering a Cashplus account with us, you’ll have a username and password which must be used in order to access certain restricted parts of the website. Your username and password are used by us to identify you, so they’re very important. You’re responsible for all information posted on the website by anyone using your username and password. Any breach of security of a username and password should be notified to us immediately.

We recommend you also read our [guidelines on keeping your Cashplus prepaid Gold MasterCard® safe](https://web.archive.org/customer-help/card-security.aspx "Keeping your card safe")

## Our system security

  * Our systems operate on 128-bit secure encryption. Look for the yellow padlock symbol in your browser status bar
  * A team of independent security experts regularly tests our website 
  * Your session will time out if you don’t use your keyboard for more than 15 minutes
  * Your Cashplus Account Members’ log-in will be locked out after three failed access attempts. You’ll need to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/default.aspx "Contact Us") to reset your account
  * We’ll verify your identity before disclosing confidential information over the phone or resetting your password
  * We don’t guarantee the website will be fault free and don’t accept liability for any errors or omissions 



All forms and online account pages, i.e. those pages that show your information, use 128-bit encryption. Encryption makes your information unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. In addition, a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used to connect your browser to our secure servers. 

The latest browsers support 128-bit encryption. Older browsers (such as Internet explorer 5.0) support lower levels of encryption (40-bit or 56-bit) but they still remain extremely secure. 

### Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

A "Secure Socket Layer" is a commonly used method of managing the security of messages transmitted across the Internet and is used by us to connect your computer to our secure server. You can tell that SSL is in use if you are using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator when a small padlock icon appears on your browser status bar. If you have problems getting to secure mode, install one of the latest browsers and try the website again. 

### Which browser do I need to view this website?

Our website has been designed to work with a variety of the latest browsers on either Apple Macintosh computers or Windows based PCs. 

If you’re using an older browser such as Internet Explorer 3, Opera 3 and 4, you’ll be able to view the information pages, but you may not be able to apply for a card or access your account information. To make an application online we recommend that you upgrade to the latest versions. 

### Need to change your screen resolution?

We recommend viewing this website with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or above. 

### Do you need plug-ins?

"Plug-ins" are additional software programs required by some websites to make them work properly. An example is Flash Player from Adobe. Our website doesn’t need any plug-ins to work effectively. 

### Having difficulty accessing your account from work?

Most organisations have what is known as a "firewall" to protect their networks and their computers. A firewall is a secure server through which all communication passes and which protects the organisation's computers from unauthorised access by filtering the information getting in and out. Depending on how the firewall is set up, access to another secure server may be denied. 

If you’re having problems accessing your account from work but can access it from home with no difficulties, check with your IT department to see if a firewall is in place that may be affecting access to our website and how this has been set up. 

## Use of email

Please note that ordinary email is not secure. 

Please don’t send us any confidential information via email. We’ll only use email to send you account information, such as your account balance and transaction information or special offers, if you’ve given your consent. We won’t use e-mail to send other confidential personal information to you. We can’t accept any responsibility for the unauthorised access by a third party and/or the corruption of data being sent by individuals to APS. It’s our policy that if any of our customers are victims of unauthorised access to their accounts, and provided that you have not breached our security procedures, acted fraudulently or without reasonable care, we’ll cover any direct financial loss which you may have suffered. 

We’ll never send emails to you requesting security or any other confidential information. Don’t reply to any such emails or disclose any personal information. If you think you’ve received a fraudulent email that’s designed to look as if it was sent from us, forward the entire email including the header and footer to [fraud@apsgroup.com](mailto:fraud@apsgroup.com "fraud@apsgroup.com") then delete it from your email account.

## Phishing

Some customers may receive an email claiming to be from APS, AFL with a link to what appears to be our, AFL's website, where they are prompted to enter their personal and account details. APS is in no way involved with this email and the website does not belong to us, AFL. APS will never send emails to its customers requesting security or any other confidential information. Don’t reply to any such emails or disclose any personal information in these websites. If you think you’ve received a fraudulent email that looks like it is from APS or AFL, forward the entire email including the header and footer to fraud@apsgroup.com and then delete it from your email account.
