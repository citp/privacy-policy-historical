# Cashplus - Security and Privacy

**1.  Introduction**

1.1       When you apply for a product or service from us, you’ll be asked for personal information and data that is needed to process your application. We’ll take great care to protect your privacy.

1.2       In this policy we’ll provide details of how you can also help guard yourself against online fraud. We also set out, as data controller, how we’ll act in relation to your data and how we’ll use such data.

1.3       Web security is very important to us, so we take great care to protect you. Please see below for details of how you can also help to guard yourself against online fraud. We ask that you remember the following:

Keep yourself safe online:

  * Never reveal your password to anyone or write it down
  * Don’t use a password that could be easily guessed by someone else
  * Change your password immediately if you suspect someone else could know it
  * Log off when you’ve completed your transaction
  * Keep your devices updated with current anti-virus software, the latest browser versions and operating systems.
  * Don’t send us any confidential account information by email or via social media
  * Treat emails you receive with caution. Remember that we’ll never ask you to disclose your personal or account information to us by email
  * We recommend you regularly visit the [Financial Fraud Action website](https://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/consumer/advice/protect-your-onlinemobile-banking/) to keep up-to-date with tips to protect yourself from the latest scams



1.4          Your Username and Password

On registering a Cashplus Account with us, you’ll have a username and password which must be used to access certain restricted parts of our website. Your username and password are used by us to identify you, so they’re very important. You’re responsible for all information posted on our website by anyone using your username and password. Any breach of security of a username and password should be notified to us immediately.

1.5           Our system security

Our systems operate on 256-bit secure encryption. Look for the padlock symbol in your browser status bar. Encryption makes your information unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. In addition, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to connect your browser to our secure servers. A team of independent security experts regularly test our website. Your Online Servicing session will time out if you remain inactive for more than 15 minutes. Your Cashplus Account login will be locked out after three failed access attempts. You’ll need to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) to reset your account. We’ll verify your identity before disclosing confidential information over the phone or resetting your password. Despite our best endeavors, we can’t always guarantee the website will be fault free and we don’t accept liability for any errors or omissions.

1.6          Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a commonly used method of managing the security of messages transmitted across the Internet and is used by us to connect your computer to our secure server. You can tell that TLS is in use if our website URL in the search bar starts with https:// and/or a lock icon is displayed within your browser. If you have problems getting to secure mode, install one of the latest browsers and try the website again.

1.7          Browser Use

Our website has been designed to work with a variety of the latest browsers across Mobile, Tablet and Desktop devices.

If you’re using an older browser such as Internet Explorer 10, you may have difficulty viewing webpages and not be able to apply for a card or access your account information. Your security could also be weakened. To make an application online, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest versions.

1.8          Plug-ins

“Plug-ins” are additional software programs required by some websites to make them work properly. An example is Flash Player from Adobe. Our website doesn’t need any plug-ins to work effectively, however you’ll need a PDF reader such as [Adobe Acrobat Reader](http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/) to download certain documents, such as Terms and Conditions.

1.9          Network Protection

Most organisations have what is known as a "firewall” to protect their networks and their computers. A firewall is a secure server through which all communication passes and which protects the organisation’s computers from unauthorised access by filtering the information getting in and out. Depending on how the firewall is set up, access to another secure server may be denied.

It’s possible that due to the set-up of firewalls, certain networks may restrict access to our website.

1.10        Cashplus Mobile App Terms of Use

By downloading and using the Cashplus Mobile App or providing information to us, you consent to the use and transfer of your information as set out below and in this overall privacy policy page. It should also be taken in conjunction with the Cashplus Account Terms and Conditions.

You also consent to any additional cardholders and delegated authorities, previously agreed when you set up your account having access on your account to relevant statement information including account balance information through the Cashplus Mobile App.

IMPORTANT: Additional Cardholders must have permission from the Primary Cardholder before downloading and using the Cashplus Mobile App.

1.11        Using the Cashplus Mobile App

You can use our Cashplus Mobile App to view and access your eligible Cashplus Accounts. Use of the Cashplus Mobile App is in accordance with these conditions and you’ll need to register to use the service.

You’ll be responsible for all instructions given by you or anyone acting with your authority whilst using the Cashplus Mobile App. Please note this includes any errors or instructions sent by someone other than yourself so please don’t leave your device unattended while you’re logged-in to the App.

We don’t charge you for using the Cashplus Mobile App but your mobile operator may charge for some services.

You must only use the Cashplus Mobile App for online account servicing and other intended uses. You must not copy, reproduce or attempt to alter it in any way.

To use the Cashplus Mobile App, small software files similar to Cookies will be stored on your mobile device. These files allow the Cashplus Mobile App to remember choices you make (such as your user name or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These files are used to store your registration information and your acceptance of Terms and Conditions. The information these files collect may be anonymised so they can’t track your browsing activity on other websites. The files are essential to enable you to move around and use the features of the Cashplus Mobile App.

In addition to the above, non-personal data may be collected by your mobile device or app store provider in accordance with their Terms and Conditions which apply to the use of your device and app store account.

The Cashplus Mobile App uses location based services. Data about your location (i.e. GPS signals from your mobile device) or data that can be used to approximate your location, is used to provide features such as the ‘Store Locator’ and for the prevention of fraud and/or money laundering.

1.12        Cashplus Mobile App Service

We aim to ensure a complete service at all times, but the speed and availability of service can’t be guaranteed. The service may be interrupted due to our need to update or maintain our systems or those of third-parties who provide part of the service. In addition, the service may be affected by the network coverage available from your mobile service provider or maintenance and upgrades they perform that affect the availability of your mobile network.

The Cashplus Mobile App can be used all over the world but can only be downloaded if you have a UK App Store or Google Play Account. Just make sure you use a secure Wi-Fi connection and check with your network provider to ensure you don’t experience higher than usual roaming data charges for using the App abroad.

We reserve the right to withdraw the Cashplus Mobile App at any time.

1.13        Use of email and social media

Please note that ordinary email is not secure. Please don’t send us any confidential information via email or social media. We’ll only use email to send you account information, such as your account balance and transaction information or special offers. Marketing preferences can be managed via the Cashplus Mobile App and Online Servicing. We won’t use email to send other confidential information to you. We can’t accept any responsibility for the unauthorised access by a third party and/or the corruption of data being sent by individuals to Cashplus. It’s our policy that if any of our customers are victims of unauthorised access to their accounts, and provided that you’ve not breached our security procedures, acted fraudulently or without reasonable care, we may cover any direct financial loss which you may have suffered.
