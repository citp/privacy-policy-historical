Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using. MyCashNow, or our third-party service providers (including advertising service providers) may place cookies or Flash objects on the computer you are using so that we can continually improve the design, content, and functionality of our site to better serve you.

Cookies allow us to:

    * Offer more relevant content and/or services
    * Collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on site and pages visited
    * Monitor viewing and responses to MyCashNow advertisements
  
When you visit our site, MyCashNow utilizes cookies to monitor your navigation of our site and provide you with information on products and services that best fit your needs. Cookies we use do not contain or capture personally identifiable information. If you choose not to accept cookies from MyCashNow you may not have access to use all or part of our site or you may not benefit fully from the information and services offered.

MyCashNow’s advertising service providers may serve advertising through the use of web beacons. A web beacon is placed on a web page and, in addition to setting HTML cookies, can capture information such as IP address, time, web browser, time zone and domain. Other technologies we use may capture customer specific data to help us understand how customers use our site. 

  4. **Advertising**  
MyCashNow’s advertising service providers advertise our services on websites not affiliated with us. MyCashNow uses cookies on our website and the sites on which we advertise to track advertising performance and to collect aggregate data on webpage viewing. Cookies are not used to collect or disseminate any personal information.

We and our non-MyCashNow advertising service providers use this information, as well as other information they have or we may have, to help make decisions about ads you see on other sites. 

Some ads that you receive are customized based on your visits over time and across different Web sites. This type of customization – sometime referred to as behavioral or interest-based advertising – is enabled through your computer browser and browser cookies. Information collected by these cookies is not personally identifiable. This type of advertising not only helps you to receive more customized advertising offers and promotions but also helps support the free content, products, and services you get online.

If you prefer not to have non-personal information used in this way, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising by visiting this link <http://www.aboutads.info/>.

Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from MyCashNow. Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior. In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on the computer you are using, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access the site from a different computer, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers you will need to opt out again. If the browser you are using has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check the browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.

MyCashNow is not affiliated with [www.aboutads.info/](http://www.aboutads.info/) and cannot warrant the effectiveness of the opt out procedures.
