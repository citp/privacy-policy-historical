**Personal information collected**

When you visit, register or use the services on this website, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself, including your name and your contact details. We may also collect information about how you use this website including your searches, the properties and pages you look at, the advertisers or partners you contact and the contents of the emails you send to them. Finally, we may also collect information from any correspondence that you have with us. Collectively, we refer to this as "Your Information".

All of the forms where you might enter personal information on our website have tick box options to enable you to specify your consent (or otherwise) to our use of Your Information. We always use the the most recently submitted form to be your current consent status. If you are a registered user, but not signed in when you submit a form, we won't be able to use your saved settings so will deem your consent choice to be as per the form you submit at the time.

## How we use Your Information

Your Information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of this Site and to supply the services and features that you have requested. We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in our marketing and to help us develop, administer, support and improve our services and features.

We may use Your Information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you occasionally about important changes or developments to this Site or our services. Where you have consented, we may also use Your Information to contact you with details about any other products or services we or our partners or advertisers offer that may be of interest to you. Where you have consented to being contacted by third parties, we may make Your Information available to them. If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please contact us here and tell us.

The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.

_Contacting Advertisers_

The information that you enter into any of the forms we offer to allow you to contact advertisers is recorded by us and then sent to the advertiser that you chose to contact. This helps them provide you with a more personalised service. [We also send the advertiser details of your last search to help them find property that matches your requirements more closely. If you are a registered user and signed in when you contact an advertiser, we include your settings to help them to provide more personalised services to you]

Email a Friend

When you use the email a friend feature of this Site we record which properties you have sent to the friend, solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service. We will NOT add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists or inform the advertiser, to protect you and the recipient's privacy.

Registering with us

If you register with us, we save the details you provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we offer to you. You can update your details at any time via the site. When you are signed in, we automatically pre-populate your saved details on contact forms.

Saving properties

If you select a property as a "favourite", we can identify which properties you have selected. We may aggregate these details to indicate how many users have selected a property as a "favourite", but we will not make available to third parties any personal data relating to which users have selected a property as a "favourite". 

Using the property alerts and saved searches

If you register with us, save searches and/or use the property alerts feature to receive notification when new properties matching your criteria are added to this Site, we record the settings you use and which properties have been sent to you. We do not make any information about any property that has been sent to you available to our advertisers or third parties.
