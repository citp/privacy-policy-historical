# Policies - My Crazy Good Life

## Policies for Crazy Good Media and My Crazy Good Life

Effective date: May 17, 2019

###  **Affiliate Links**

Affiliate links are used on this site. This means that when you click the link on my site (for example, an Amazon.com link) and make a purchase, I could earn a small percentage of commission for your purchase. This does not charge you any more than it would normally, it’s just a thank you from the site for referring traffic. I use affiliate links because it’s a way that I can afford to bring you great content for free. I participate in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.

###  **Comment Policy**

Your policy will be approved and published as long as it doesn’t contain the following: spammy links, hateful or hurtful language, or irrelevant content. I reserve the right to delete any comment on my site.

### Disclosure Policy

 **I sometimes review products or services without being compensated.** I do this so that I can share my thoughts on these products with you.  **I will sometimes receive free products or services to review** , and will only write about those products if I can do so in an honest way. If I were to receive a product that I did not care for I would not recommend it to you. **Sometimes, I receive monetary compensation to write about a product, service, or business.** I may tell you about a product that I haven’t had personal experience with. If I receive free product or monetary compensation about a product, I will add a disclosure to the beginning and/or end of the post telling you so. Advertisers: all links on My Crazy Good Life are no-follow. No exceptions.

I close giveaways within 24 hours of them ending, unless an emergency comes up (I am a mom first, you know!). I’ll contact the winner via email and the winner will have 48 hours to contact me back unless otherwise noted in my email.

###  **Links to other websites**

My Crazy Good Life contains links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave this blog, you should note that I do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, I cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

###  **How My Crazy Good Life  uses cookies**

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

This blog uses traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps me analyze data about web page traffic and improve my website in order to tailor it to customer needs and wants. I only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help me provide you with a better website, by enabling me to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives this blog access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

###  **Advertising**

I use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on my website, which allows me to bring you the great content you see here. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Some of my advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. I do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. I may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the website and these vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith.
