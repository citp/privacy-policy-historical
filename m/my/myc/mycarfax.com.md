**What information do we collect? How do we use it?** (back to top)  
When you order CARFAX Vehicle History Reports, we require your name, mailing address, e-mail address, credit card number, and expiration date. This information allows us to process your order and deliver your reports to you.

For each CARFAX Vehicle History Report you request, you will also enter the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). This is the unique 17-character identification number that is used to search our database for information about the vehicle's history. Once you enter the VIN of a vehicle, the CARFAX report will appear on screen and an email version of the same CARFAX Report will be sent to you via email for your records. 

You may be asked to complete brief surveys while on the CARFAX web site. These surveys help us to better understand how you are using the information, and help us to develop better products and services for you. These surveys may be administered by CARFAX or by a third party.

You may receive periodic email communications from CARFAX that include special offers and promotions related to the used car buying and ownership process. Should you choose to "opt-out" of receiving these email communications, you will only receive the email communications that contain the CARFAX Reports you order. To unsubscribe to any of our communications or ask any questions about our services or our products, please [ click here](http://www.carfax.com/help) to contact us or you can [unsubscribe here.](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.cfx)

We also track user traffic patterns to uncover ways in which we can improve the site and make it easier to use. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how many customers look at each page.

**How does CARFAX protect customer information?** (back to top)  
When you place an order with CARFAX, we offer the use of a secure server. All information you enter is encrypted via a secure sockets layer (SSL) before it is sent over the Internet to our secure servers.
