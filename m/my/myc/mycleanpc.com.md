# Personal Identifying Information (PII) - Privacy Policy | MyCleanPC.com

USTechSupport Corporation ("USTechSupport") has adopted this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to address customers' concerns about privacy and personal information. It applies both to personal identifying information and to other information. Personal identifying information ("PII") is information that is recorded in any form, is about you or pertains to you, and can be connected to you. It includes your name, telephone number, email address, billing address, driver's license number, credit card account information, and social security number. USTechSupport maintains the confidentiality of your PII and only USTechSupport and certain persons and entities working for and with USTechSupport to conduct business with you have access to it. Other information, which is described in more detail below, is information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you, and may be provided by USTechSupport to others for limited purposes.

You may find it helpful to compare our Policy with guidelines issued by organizations such as TRUSTe. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose stated mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. USTechSupport is not a licensee of TRUSTe's privacy program, but we are committed to complying with TRUSTe's guidelines.

  
If you have questions or concerns regarding the Policy, please contact the USTechSupport.com Privacy Information Department by emailing[ privacy@ustechsupport.com](mailto:privacy@USTechSupport.com), by calling (888) 427-9359, or by sending a letter to the USTechSupport.com Privacy Information Department at 3340 Ocean Park Blvd. Suite 1060 , Santa Monica, CA 90405.

USTechSupport voluntarily complies with the requirements of the Safe Harbor framework in connection with the transfer to the United States of PII from countries which are members of the European Union ("EU"). As a result, PII provided by residents of countries which are members of the EU will be subject to the Safe Harbor Principles published by the United States Department of Commerce ("the Safe Harbor Principles"). The Principles can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.

In order to personalize our communications with you and to improve our products and services, we also may ask you to provide consumer satisfaction information and other information regarding your personal and professional interests, your experience with our products and services, and additional contact information. You have the option of choosing not to provide the information.

**Our Use of the Information We Collect**  
USTechSupport uses the information we collect from you to conduct business with you and to understand your interests and requirements so that we can provide the products and services you want. Specifically, we use your PII in connection with fulfillment of orders, to complete payments made by you with your credit or debit card; to manage your account, to renew your subscription(s), to make offers and promotions, to provide information about our products and services that we believe will be important to you, and to help us address any concerns you may have about our products and services. We use your credit or debit card account or electronic funds transfer information only for payment processing and fraud protection, and not for any other purpose.

We employ contractors in our business, including persons who work from time to time in our call centers. The contractors may collect PII from you in the same manner and to the same extent that USTechSupport collects PII from you. The contractors are required, pursuant to agreements they enter into with us, to maintain the security and confidentiality of your PII.

We have business relationships with certain entities that provide services in connection with our business, such as credit and debit card payment processing, and that require access to your PII. Your PII will be provided to them in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy unless we, or they, inform you otherwise and obtain your consent. It is possible that they may provide to USTechSupport certain PII relating to you. In that event, we will handle the PII in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We also provide certain information to advertisers and marketers. The information we provide is aggregated before we provide it to advertisers and marketers, and it does not include PII.

If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, and you do not opt out, we occasionally may send you email with information, recommendations and promotional information about our products and services. At the time you register or make a purchase, you will be given the opportunity to opt into or opt out of this service. If you do not initially choose to opt out, you may still block certain emails from us simply by following the "unsubscribe" instructions that accompany all communications. In addition, we send service and notifications by email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders and account, and to provide updates and technical notices. Some of these communications are required by law, such as communications regarding the automatic renewal of licenses and services you have purchased. Other communications are essential to the management of your account and the continuing functionality of our products and services, and therefore an opt-out option is not available and the communications cannot be blocked.

**Your Consent**  
By purchasing our licenses and services, and by visiting our Websites, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your PII and other information by USTechSupport, its officers, directors, and employees, and USTechSupport's agents and contractors, as set forth in this Policy.

Your PII will be transferred outside the EU and outside the country of your residence, and will be examined, processed and stored in the United States. As a result, third parties, including governments, courts and law enforcement and regulatory agencies, may be able to gain access to your PII under applicable United States laws.

applicable law.

**_In addition, USTechSupport reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time, and without notice, to you to disclose to third parties, including law enforcement authorities, any of your information, including PII, that USTechSupport deems appropriate to: (a) comply with any applicable law or regulation, legal process, or governmental request; or (b) prevent possible harm or injury to any person or damage to any property._**
