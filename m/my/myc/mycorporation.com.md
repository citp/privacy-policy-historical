# MyCorporation privacy policy

My Corporation Dot Com (hereinafter "MYCORP") has created this Privacy Statement to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the site mycorporation.com:

**SECURE SITE**  
Our site uses an online secure order form for customers to apply. When your order is placed through our secure online server, or you send us an email, we collect confidential customer information. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all order information you input before it is sent to us. When you send us an email (as distinguished from a secure order form, which is encrypted), it is not necessarily secure and is not encrypted. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

**WHAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?**  
The customer information that is collected to process your order might include contact information (name, mailing address, telephone number, fax number and/or email address); corporate information (Business name and description of business, information regarding directors, officers, members, stockholders and registered agent and information regarding shares of stock and par value); and financial information (name on account, credit card number and expiration date), depending upon the nature of your order.

The contact information, corporate information and financial information from the order form are used to process your request. The customer's contact, corporate and financial information is private and confidential. All information is secured and maintained on-file in our corporate office in Agoura Hills, California and is sometimes used to contact the customer for purposes of completing the services requested by the customer. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the customer and this information is not shared with anyone outside of our company, except the merchant bank for the processing of credit card orders and the state office to which the requested documents will be submitted.

Our hosting service logs IP addresses, browser types and referred logs which is used by our marketing staff for internal purposes only. Users can call 1-888-mycorp1 to remove contact, corporate and/or financial information from our databases and to not receive any future communications from us or to change or modify any contact, corporate and/or financial information previously provided to us.

**PROMOTIONS**  
To preserve customer's anonymity and to assure the quality of customer communications, MYCORP provides customers with the opportunity to "opt-in" to any further marketing promotions. Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us or our partners at the point where we request information.

**STATUS PAGE**   
Information relating to the status of an order, including only the corporate name and status of the requested service will be displayed on a "status page" of the mycorporation.com site. 

**DISCLOSURE TO OUTSIDE PARTIES**  
Aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information may be provided to reputable third parties, but these statistics contain no personally identifying information. However, MYCORP may release client account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with law, prevent fraud, enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or to otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of MYCORP, our customers or other third parties.

**COOKIES**  
MYCORP may use outside companies to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies (pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes while at the site). While we use cookies in other parts of our site, our ad company collects cookies received with banner ads and we do not have any access to this information.

**YOUR CONSENT**  
By using our site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by MYCORP. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
