# Privacy Policy » MyComeUp World

MyComeUp.com, (“MyComeUp” or “we”) take your privacy very seriously. MyComeUp knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting MyComeUp.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

This notice describes MyComeUp’s Privacy Policy use and sharing of Personally Identifiable Information (such as full name, email address, date of birth, gender and address) that is required when you sign up to use MyComeUp’s services, including MyComeUp mobile, MyComeUp applications and MyComeUp’s other features. It also provides information about our relationships with certain third parties that provide services in connection with the MyComeUp Services.

**Information Collected by MyComeUp:**

• Information Provided by You: When MyComeUp collects Personally Identifiable Information from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting registration requirements to us in order to register as a member of MyComeUp. You are required to provide information such as your name, email address, password, gender and date of birth. This information is used to set up your personal profile. As part of your personal profile, you may choose to submit additional information such as your hobbies and interests and other content, such as photos, music, videos, etc. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take full advantage of many of our features. Your date of birth allows us to show you age-appropriate content and advertisements.

• Automatic Information: We receive, store and analyze certain types of information, which is transmitted automatically whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use cookies to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses MyComeUp.com; Internet protocol (IP) address; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform, this data is used to manage and improve the MyComeUp Services, track usage, and for security purposes; clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number and pages you viewed or searched for. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages and page interaction information.

• MyComeUp does not store credit card information. Credit card transactions are processed through reputable third-party financial gateways. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or financial gateway site to determine, among other things; how they will handle any personally identifiable information they collect from you.

**IP Addresses:**

Your computer uses IP addresses every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Our Web servers may be configured to automatically collect IP addresses in our logs. We also may record your IP address if you sign up for an account.

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies:**

• “Cookies” are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer’s Internet browser. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website or other platform. For example, cookies can store your session for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited. They enable us to make your use of the MyComeUp Services more enjoyable.

• “Flash cookies” In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as ”flash cookies,” in connection with the MyComeUp Services, including the video player. These cookies are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content, including advertisements that we serve, on our website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Please note that disabling flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.

• “Web beacons” We also may use services that collect data remotely by using so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”), which can be embedded in content and advertising on the MyComeUp Services, in an email message, or on a third party’s website or other platform. A Pixel Tag is a small string of code that provides a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Pixel Tags can recognize certain types of information on your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed. We may use Pixel Tags to improve your MyComeUp experience, including to provide you with content customized to your interests.

The Help portion of your toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Web site. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of MyComeUp’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to utilize the services that require you to Sign in.

Circumstances In Which MyComeUp May Release Information:

Other Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your Rights or Ours

• There may be instances when we may disclose your information without providing you with a choice when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order) or with requests of law enforcement authorities; to enforce or apply this Policy or MyComeUp’s other policies or agreements; to protect MyComeUp or our users’ rights, property, safety or security; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of MyComeUp Site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.

• MyComeUp may also disclose information about its users to law enforcement officers or others, if you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by MyComeUp or another user of the MyComeUp Services, we may provide the information that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint. For instance, if you submit a notice of copyright infringement to us, we may send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication.

• In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business, make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger and substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, your personally identifiable information generally is one of the transferred assets involved in the transaction.

**Your Profile Information:**

Your user profile contains information about you that you may want to share with others. The list of privacy setting for your profile includes options to provide information only to connections rather than all members. Other options allow you to specify how much and how broadly your profile information should be viewable throughout the MyComeUp network or via the web through your “Privacy Settings”.

Protecting the privacy of your profile is your responsibility; we caution you not to share sensitive information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver’s license numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place such information in your profile.

MyComeUp may use profile information for the purposes of providing our services to you, such as to analyze our demographics, or to better personalize our various offerings for users.

Additionally, any information you choose to display on MyComeUp, including your profile, will be viewable by other members. Certain non-identifying information, including your “profile picture” and “user name” may be viewable by non-members.

**You Control Who Shares Your Information:**

Your MyComeUp profile information will only be shared with people you have specifically agreed to share such information with, and to other members of groups you choose to belong to. You can limit who can view certain personal information, such as email addresses and phone numbers. Please take into consideration that if you choose to share your personal information (including any comments, videos, photos or any other information) to other members on MyComeUp, you do so at your own risk. MyComeUp recommends that you don’t share your personal contact information.

You can choose to make your profile Private to non-members of MyComeUp by editing your profile in “Private Settings” in your “Account”.

To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters and numbers makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis.  
MyComeUp is designed so that the content you generate within the network (groups, blogs, events, etc.) will have an associated privacy setting. If the information being created has its own privacy control (i.e. when creating a blog), it is the users responsibility to select the desired privacy setting upon creation. Other items may inherit an existing privacy setting. It is the user’s responsibility to understand the associated privacy setting before creating content to ensure the handling of their information meets their expectations.

**Information You Can Access:**

MyComeUp gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with MyComeUp for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Examples of information you can access easily:

• Personally Identifiable Information located in “Account Settings” (includes name, e-mail, password, location, etc.)

• E-mail Notification settings located in “Privacy Settings” under “Notifications” tab (includes Friend Request, forum subscriptions, comments, etc.)

• Shared Content settings located in “Privacy Settings” under “Profile” and “Items” tabs (includes date of birth, profile information, blogs, photos, etc.)

If you are a member and no longer wish to participate in MyComeUp.com network you can sign in to the site, at the top of the page click on “Account” then “Account Settings”; select “Cancel Account” at the bottom of the page and follow the simple instructions.

Internet Awareness, Security and Confidentiality:
