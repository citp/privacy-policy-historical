<p>We may also disclose personal information to law enforcement, or the   appropriate civil authorities to enforce legal rights and comply with   the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other   competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure   is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference  with  our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be  harmed or  may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure  is  necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a   judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Crytek.</p>
