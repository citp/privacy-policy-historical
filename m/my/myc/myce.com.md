Most of the information is automatically collected using the Google Analytics statistics tool. This information is needed to operate this community, not to track you down.

These purchases are subject to the policies and procedures of those sites. Order fulfillment and customer service relating to orders placed at any of those third party sites, including the collection of applicable sales taxes, are the sole responsibility of such sites.
