##  **III.   ****How We Collect Your Information**

When you visit this Website, we automatically collect certain information from your computer or mobile device. This Website uses software called cookies, web beacons, and/or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) to collect such information. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' computer browsers when they visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of our Website and the internet to personal information that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address, we do not use cookies in connection with personal information, except to ensure that visitors under the age of thirteen (13) provide a parental email address in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior of visitors and collect data about their use. For example, web beacons can be used to count the number of web page visitors or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a web page visitor. We, our third party service providers, and/or our partners use web beacons on our Website from time to time for this and other purposes.

  We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of this Website, and to improve and customize content. We, our third party service providers and/or our partners may also use Tracking Technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on this Website. This helps us provide visitors with relevant advertising.

  By visiting this Website, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand, and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your use of this Website using Tracking Technologies, and to use Tracking Technologies in emails we send you.

  Please note that you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Opting out is browser specific, meaning, if you opt out while using Safari, this choice will not affect the collection of information by Tracking Technologies when you use Internet Explorer or other web browsers. Be aware that blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered on this Website. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. 

##  **IV.   ****How We Use the Information**

We never sell or rent our visitors' personal information to third parties without appropriate consent. We may combine information we collect through our Website with information that we collect from other sources. On occasions we use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes, sending prizes to winners, or providing customer service. We require agents and contractors to keep visitors’ personal information confidential and to use it only for the specific services being performed. We use non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Website, and improve our visitors' experience. We also may aggregate, use and share this information with third parties to analyze Website usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services to our visitors.

  We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a subpoena, court order or other legal process. We may also use and disclose such information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Website and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units is acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity.

We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ways described above without updating this Policy. 

##  **V.   ****Collection of Information by Third-Party Websites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors**

We use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other service providers (collectively, “Third Party Providers”). These Third Party Providers do not have access to the information we collected about you, except to the extent necessary to provide services to this Website. For example, a Third Party Provider may require information to provide you with advertisements that interest you based on your visits to the Website and/or other sites. Third Party Providers may have their own Tracking Technologies that collect your information while you are on this Website. As such, Third Party Providers may place Tracking Technologies on the device you are using to access this Website. The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Providers is subject to their privacy policies and is not under our control, and therefore, where applicable, please consults the privacy policies of Third Party Providers. 

##  **VI.   ****Security**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect from you and to ensure the information is correctly used. We limit access to visitors’ information to employees, contractors, and Third Party Providers who are authorized for the proper handling of such information. Information collected from visitors of this Website will not be stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this Policy. 

##  **VII.   ****Children’s Privacy and Parental Review**

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians (the “Parents”) about what personally identifiable information we collect from children under 13 years of age (the “Kid”), how we collect the information, and what we do with the information. Furthermore, COPPA requires that we obtain consent from Parents in order to allow Kids to use features of this Website that require them to provide us with personally identifiable information.

  Kids can view content and use many of the Website’s services without any personally identifiable information being collected. We only collect personally identifiable information, if at all, from Kids when they provide it to us by participating in certain activities on this Website that require registration, or use Social Media Sites in connection with this Website. Such personally identifiable information may include: (1) first name; (2) last name; (3) birth date; (4) gender; (5) country of residence; (6) state (if applicable); (7) city; (8) zip code; (9) user name; (10) login password; (11) telephone number; and (12) other relevant information. When a Kid participates in an activity on this Website that requires the collection, retention, and use of personally identifiable information, we ask for the Kid’s Parent’s email address so that we can notify the Parent that we have received personally identifiable information from their Kid. For specific one-time requests we receive from Kids, email addresses are collected, but are not stored in a retrievable form, but instead stored using a “hash” or unique code generated from the email address that will allow us on a one-time basis, for example, to respond to an inquiry from the child regarding a lost user name or password. Furthermore, we never require a Kid to disclose more personally identifiably information than is reasonably necessary as a condition of participation in any Website activity.

  We use Kids’ personal information for internal purposes only, such as enabling Kids to enter our online contests or sweepstakes, to subscribe to an online newsletter, to provide customer service, and/or for the purpose the information is provided. If a Kid wins a sweepstakes or contest, we notify the Parent at the Parent’s email address provided to us during the registration process and request that the Parent provide their postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. We use Parents' e-mail addresses to notify them when we have received personal information such as e-mail addresses from their Kid and to give Parents the option to remove their Kid’s name from our database. If we do not hear back from a Parent, we assume the Parent approves of the Kid providing us with personally identifiable information, and any activities the information was provided for.

  If we make a material change to our Policy as it relates to Kids, we will notify Parents by email. Please make sure to update us if your email address changes, so we can notify you of such changes. We will only make material changes to our Policy in conformance with applicable law.

  Please send a letter or postcard to our www.myvortexx.com Privacy Manager at the mailing address provided below if you would like to do any of the following: (1) access personally identifiable information that we have from your Kid; (2) correct factual errors in such information;  (3) request to have this information deleted; or (4) request that we no longer collect or maintain such information.

  Please be sure to include your e-mail address and a telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your Kid’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that we collect and maintain about your Kid.
