## THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

There are three general categories of information collected from Website visitors:

(a) user information requested by the Website ("User Information"),

(b) information collected by the Website from the electronic device (e.g., computer, laptop, tablet, smart phone) and Internet browser which the visitor is using to access the Website ("Computer Information"), and

(c) information collected by third-party advertisers, website analytics providers and other partners ("Third-Party Information") to whom we have granted access to the Website.

Here is some more detailed information regarding the three categories of information collected from Website visitors.

(a) User Information

 **1\. Do we collect information from you to use or register on our site?**

Registration for myvortexx.com is not required. Kids can use and enjoy the site anonymously without registration. However, we do provide the option of registering. If a child chooses to register on myvortexx.com, we ask for a limited amount of information, such as a screen name and password. Once a child is registered, we use this information to allow the child to save avatars created on the site, earn points, and "tag" content. We also store a history of the last five things that a registered user has viewed so that the child can easily return to these Website locations. We do not use the user's screen name or password for any other purpose.

We do not collect Personal Information on the Website from children under age thirteen (13).

2\. What types of community or social features do we offer you on our site and how do we keep these areas safe?

myvortexx.com does not allow for open messaging between its users, nor does it allow for the use of third party social networks. While myvortexx.com does allow its users to “rate” content, we do not currently provide users the ability to upload user- generated content to the site.

3\. Do we offer other features on our site that ask you to provide information?

We do ask users to provide us with information to help improve the overall experience of the site. We do so by providing the ability for users to send us feedback and suggestions through a widget form. We do not ask for any Personal Information on this form.

Additionally, on occasion, we may run contests or polls created by us or by third-party partners and/or advertisers. If we conduct a contest or sweepstakes on our Website, we will collect email addresses from entrants so that we may contact the winners of the contest or sweepstakes. Any email addresses collected from entrants to a contest or sweepstakes will be used on a one-time basis. After the contest or sweepstakes prizing has been awarded, we will remove the email addresses collected with respect to the contest or sweepstakes from the applicable Website database. If we collect and store any other Personal Information in addition to the user's contact information as part of these activities, we will first ask for parental permission.

(b) Computer Information.

4\. Do we collect information from you using cookies or other web technologies?

The Website uses technologies, including cookies, to help make the site faster and easier for kids to use. For example, we may use cookies to “cache” (i.e., remember) content for users or to remember a user's avatar so that when the user enters the user's screen name on the Website, that user's avatar will appear. "Cookies" may also assist us in saving your online game settings and your media player settings for facilitating future viewing of streaming content.
