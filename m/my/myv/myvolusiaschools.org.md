## Introduction

The District respects the importance of responsibly using information collected on the Website.

However, some of the District's services and products may not be available to these visitors without providing Personally Identifiable Information.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

The District collects anonymous web traffic data via tools such as Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to generate summary statistics to help guide design considerations, determine successful website segments, and determine areas we can improve the Website's functionality. In some instances, the District may be compelled by existing laws of the United States or other applicable local, state and federal laws, and applicable policies, rules and guidelines of the District, including those defined herein, to release non-personally identifiable information gathered from our web servers to law enforcement.

This information may be shared between offices, departments, groups or individuals within the District, as needed or required, and as governed by the District's data standards and information security policies. The District will not release personal information to third parties except as required by law.

## Visitor Interaction

The District allows interaction with its employees via email and forms in online and PDF formats.

## Information Security

The District will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information and will not provide, rent or sell personal information to third parties for marketing programs or any other purpose.

The District does not disclose Personally Identifiable Information, whether said information is identifiable explicitly or implicitly, except in the following cases:

  * To employees, contractors and affiliated organizations of the District when necessary to conduct business, and only upon their agreement to not subsequently disclose the information.
  * When required to do so by law.
  * When the District believes in good faith disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect its property, its rights, third parties and the public well-being.
