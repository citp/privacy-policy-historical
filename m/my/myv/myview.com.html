		<h3>Effective November 2007</h3>
		<h3>Modified October, 2008</h3>
		<br>
		<h5>Introduction:</h5>
		<p>We know that your privacy is important to you. Authentic Response, Inc. is the provider of the MyView Service.  We provide statistical sample to organizations that conduct research generally for marketing or for social science purposes.  We're committed to helping you understand how we manage and protect it, we take privacy seriously, and have taken many steps to help safeguard the information we collect and manage for you.</p>
		<p>This privacy policy is provided to inform you of our policies and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and how that information is used.  Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site and participating in the Service, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or participate in the Service.</p>
		<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you may contact the Authentic Response Privacy Office at <a href="mailto:privacy@myview.com">privacy@myview.com</a>. If you have any Customer Service issues, please contact <a href="app?cmd=ContactUs">customerservice@myview.com</a>.</p>

		Sincerely,<br>
		Matt Blumberg, CEO</p>
		
		<h1>The organization collecting information at this Website:</h1>
		<p>Authentic Response ("Company" or "we"), operates the websites located at <a href="http://www.authenticresponse.com">www.authenticresponse.com</a> and <a href="http://www.myview.com">www.myview.com</a> (the "Sites"). Through the Sites, we operate MyView (the "Service") through which we provide surveys that can be taken at the Sites or via email ("Surveys") to members who sign up by completing our "double opt-in" process at our Site or through one of our many partners' sites.  The double opt-in process, also referred to as "confirmed opt-in", is widely accepted as the standard for privacy, and we received a patent for that process in 2000.  The double-opt in process is unique in that not only are members sent a confirmation email following an initial request to subscribe at our website, but all members must affirmatively click an additional link in that confirmation email - confirming their opt-in preference.</p>

		<h1>The Information We Collect and Use:</h1>
		<p>By information we mean information about you collected through our Service website(s), including your email address and other information you provide to us by registering for our services or making requests for information about our services. Any information provided to us will be retained and used solely for the purposes of fulfilling your request for information, fulfilling a request through a Site feature, performing and carrying out the terms of the Service, or communicating with you as a member of the Service.</p>
		
		<h5>Registration</h5>
		<p>Registration for the Service is not required to simply view some areas of the Site. If you elect to register for the Service, we ask you for information that enables us to provide the Service. You will be registering with MyView on the form provided and such registration may require you to provide contact information such as your email address, your name, and your residential or work address.</p>
		<p>To serve you better and send you the most relevant surveys, we may also seek other personally and non-personally identifiable information about you from you, our data partners where you have given them your consent, or where such information is otherwise publicly available. Such information may include postal, demographic or profile data.</p>
		<p>If you provide us with your email address or other personal information, or if we obtain such information about you from you or from one of our partners, we will retain and use that information solely for the purpose of sending you surveys from selected marketer research companies.</p>
		<p>We support the rights of our members by limiting the use of their information for legitimate market research purposes and we make every effort to conform to the efforts of the following organizations created to uphold ethical survey research:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Marketing Research Association (MRA)</li>
			<li>Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO)</li>
			<li>Advertising Research Foundation (ARF)</li>
		</ul><br>
		
		<h5>Member Profile</h5>
		<p>To further improve targeting and relevance of our surveys, you may be asked to provide certain demographic data (like your age, gender, zip code, income) and profile data (like occupation, shopping habits and other areas of interest) as certain surveys may be directed to those participants who meet a particular profile. You will be asked to answer certain questions on forms and pages hosted by us. The information we collect will be used to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the survey and will also be maintained by us to enable us to provide you with more relevant surveys in the future. The information provided may also be used by the Service to provide you with better targeted and more relevant surveys.</p>
		<p>Panel members can unsubscribe from the service at any time, no questions asked. We know that just because you joined the panel a month ago doesn't mean that you necessarily want to stay on it forever. Every survey invitation we send is coded with a special footer that allows you to remove your name from our panel and services automatically by clicking a link provided in the message. In addition, you can discontinue your MyView membership by visiting <a href="http://portal.myview.com/portal/app?cmd=Unsubscribe&amp;_l=1&amp;_p=0">UNSUBSCRIBE</a> . To update your email address, you can either click on the "Preferences" tab after you log-in to <a href="http://www.myview.com">www.myview.com</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:update-email@myview.com">update-email@myview.com</a>.</p>
		
		<h5>Aggregate Information</h5>
		<p>From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as "cookies" and "IP addresses", which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Site.</p>

		<h5>IP Addresses</h5>
		<p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that "serve" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Company collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site. When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor or list member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's policies or to protect the Company, the Site, its visitors, the Service, our Internet Service Provider partners, the list members or others.</p>

		<h5>Cookies</h5>
		<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at the Site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -you'll find them at most websites. We use cookies on the subscription review site to verify the member's login status. They are not used to store personal information, or to retain historical or transactional member data. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Information such as the total number of visitors and pages viewed is most easily tracked with cookies. We may use the information from cookies to make improvements and updates to the Site and to tailor our services to our visitors', list members' and survey participants' needs.</p>
		<p>You always have the option of disabling cookies using your browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, please be aware that some features of the Site will not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.</p>

		<h5>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons / Web Bugs)</h5>
		<p>Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly in HTML files and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
		<p>We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other promotional communications by email, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication.</p>

		<h1>Information Sharing and Disclosure:</h1>
		<p>Except for the limited situations listed here in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties.
		
		</p><h5>Agents and Third Party Service Providers</h5>
		<p>To provide the Service to you, we may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain specialized services such as data processing or other technology services. In such instances, we may provide your personal information to those businesses but they are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other purpose.</p>
		
		<h5>Change of Control / Asset Transfer</h5>
		<p>As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all or parts of our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that the assets of the Company in whole or in parts are acquired by a third-party, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a corporate change in control or sale of all or parts of our business assets our users will be notified and given the opportunity to opt-out of any such transfer of their personal information to the new corporate entity or asset purchaser.</p>
		
		<h5>Legal Compliance</h5>
		<p>The Company reserves the right to disclose member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the Company's rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. The Company also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
		
		<h1>Communications From the Site:</h1>
		<h5>Survey Email</h5>
		<p>We will send you targeted and relevant surveys by email as is necessary to fulfill the Service to you.</p>

		<h5>Service Email</h5>
		<p>We will send you service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature, on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you email notification.</p>

		<h5>Customer Service</h5>
		<p>Based upon the information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We may communicate with you by email or telephone.</p>

		<h5>Newsletters and Promotions</h5>
		<p>We may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to additional newsletters or promotional communications sent by email. If you have opted in or otherwise qualify to receive these forms of communication, we will use your name and email address to communicate with you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</p>

		<h1>Choice/Opt-out:</h1>
		<p>Promotional Email messages are sent to fulfill the Service to you. You may opt out of these communications, which are promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them you may opt-out and/or deactivate your account by following the instructions included in each communication.</p>
		<p>Service Announcement messages are required to fulfill the Service to you. You may opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them you may opt-out and/or deactivate your account by following the instructions included in each communication.</p>
		<p>We may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to additional newsletters or promotional communications sent by email. If you have opted in or otherwise qualify to receive these forms of communication, and no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other promotional communications by email, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication.</p>

		<h1>Security and Information Protection:</h1>
		<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our payment forms, we encrypt that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
		<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
		
		<h5>Firewalls</h5>
		<p>Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. When we store information that you have provided to us when registering for the Service, that information is protected by security measures that include "firewalls" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network), "intrusion detection systems" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps detect any unauthorized visitors) and other tools such as data encryption and physical security, where appropriate. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Company strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.</p>
		
		<h5>Links to other sites</h5>
		<p>Please be aware that when you are on the Site, or when you receive an email message from us through the Service, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites from the Site's pages or from the email message we send to you that take you outside our Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit personal information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there. Note that when you link to a third party site from the Site, you may see pre-populated data fields with your personal information; however, that information is not available to the third party unless you take certain actions on the third party's site, such as submitting a form.</p>

		<h1>Privacy Policy for Children:</h1>
		<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 on the Site or through the Service. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any information to us. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
	
		<h1>Changes to this Policy:</h1>
		<p>The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made, that this Privacy Policy has been updated, and by changing the "Effective" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and participation in following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
