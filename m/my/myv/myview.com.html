<p>Thank
you for using MyView, a service of Authentic Response, Inc.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Jim Follett, CEO</p>
 
<p><b>Opt-In to MyView</b></p>
 
<p>Members
may sign up for MyView by completing the “double opt-in” process at
our Site(s) or through one of our many partners’ Websites.&nbsp; During the double opt-in process,
members are sent a confirmation email following an initial request to subscribe
at one of our Site(s) or one of our partners’ Websites, and all members
must affirmatively click an additional link in that confirmation email –
confirming their opt-in preference.</p>
 
<p><b>The Information
We Collect and Use:</b></p>
 
<p>By
information, we mean information about you collected through MyView and our
Sites, including “personally identifiable information” such as your
name, email address, residential or work address, certain demographic
information, as well as information regarding your hobbies, interests and
product ownership and other information you provide to us by registering for
MyView, participating in our surveys or services, or making requests for
information about our services. &nbsp;Registration
for MyView is not required to view non-member areas of the Sites. If you elect
to register for MyView, we ask you for information that enables us to provide MyView.
You will be registering with MyView on the form provided and such registration
may require you to provide contact information such as your email address, your
name, and your residential or work address and certain demographic information.&nbsp; In addition, from time to time, we
receive e-mail addresses from one of our partners, who may ask us to contact
you to offer you a survey.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
 
<p>We
may collect other “non-personally identifiable information” such as
your user name and password (your “Login”), IP address, and your
website browsing patterns (discussed in further detail below).&nbsp; We use such non-personally identifiable
information to serve you better and send you surveys that are most relevant to
your interests.&nbsp; We and/or our data
partners, where you have given such data partners your consent, may also seek
other personally and non-personally identifiable information from you or where
such information is otherwise publicly available.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 
<p>From
time to time we may use third party providers to validate the accuracy of
personal information you provide, so that we may offer better statistical
sample to our clients.&nbsp; We may use
third parties to provide us with data they have collected about you, and append
this data to your demographic profile.&nbsp;
In such cases only a minimum amount of information is transferred to
these third parties so as to enable them to perform specific functions on our
behalf.</p>
 
<p>Additionally,
in certain circumstances, we offer individuals the ability to participate in
our client’s surveys outside of MyView.&nbsp; If you are asked to participate in such
a survey, we will request limited non-personally identifiable information about
you.&nbsp; In some cases, after
completion of the initial survey, we may request personally identifiable
information about you in order to provide rewards, to offer you the opportunity
to join MyView, or to participate in further surveys.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
 
<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
 
<p>You
may be referred to MyView or our surveys by one of our third party business
partners.&nbsp; In the event that we ask
such partner to contact you with additional survey opportunities, we may share
certain basic personal information that we understand such partner already
maintains (such as your e-mail address and gender) as well as certain basic
information regarding your MyView activity (such as the last time you completed
a survey).</p>
 
<p>Any
information provided to us will be retained and used solely for the purposes of
fulfilling your requests, responding to your questions, offering you opportunities
to participate in surveys, performing and carrying out the terms of MyView
(including fulfilling any rewards), or communicating with you as a member of MyView.&nbsp; </p>
 
<p>We
support the rights of our members by limiting the use of their information for
legitimate market research purposes and we make every effort to conform to the
efforts of the following organizations created to uphold ethical survey
research:</p>
 
<ul type="disc">
 <li style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in">Marketing
     Research Association (MRA) </li>
 <li style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

     Research Foundation (ARF) </li>
</ul>
 
<br> 
<p><b>Member Profile</b></p>
 
<p>To
further improve the quality, targeting and relevance of our surveys, you may be
asked to provide certain demographic data (like your age, gender, zip code,
income) and profile data (like occupation, shopping habits and other areas of
interest) as certain surveys may be directed to those participants who meet a
particular profile. You will be asked to answer certain questions on forms and
pages hosted by us. The information we collect will be used to determine
whether you are eligible to participate in the survey and will also be
maintained by us to enable us to provide you with more relevant surveys in the
future.</p>

<p><b>Opt Out</b></p> 
<p>Members can unsubscribe from MyView
at any time, no questions asked. We know that just because you joined MyView a
month ago doesn't mean that you necessarily want to stay on it forever. Every
survey invitation we send is coded with a special footer that allows you to
remove your name from MyView and services automatically by clicking a link
provided in the message. In addition, you can discontinue your MyView
membership by visiting the following link:<a href="http://portal.myview.com/portal/app?cmd=Unsubscribe&amp;_l=1&amp;_p=0">
UNSUBSCRIBE</a> and following
any instructions.&nbsp; Upon unsubscribing
from MyView, we will deactivate your membership account and you will not
receive any further survey invitations; although you may continue to receive
some previously prepared survey invitations for a few days following the
termination of your membership. We will retain your personal information for an
indefinite period of time; however, we will continue to protect such personal information
in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you would like your personal information deleted from 
our site, please contact <a href="http://portal.myview.com/portal/app?cmd=ContactUs&amp;_l=1">Customer Service</a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days.  
Please note we will not be able to delete data that has been 
archived, but we can delete current live information in our database.</p>

<p><b>Aggregate Information</b></p>
 
<p>From
time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information
about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a
specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which
hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information from
you by “passive” means through the use of technologies such as
"cookies" and IP addresses, which are discussed in greater detail
below. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order
to describe the use of the Sites and MyView to our existing or potential
business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government
request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way
personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Sites.</p>
 
<p><b>IP Addresses</b></p>
 
<p>An
IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever
you're surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that "serve" web
pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses
for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third
parties and to track the use of the Sites. When visitors request pages from the
Sites or click on a link in a mailing sent through MyView our servers log the
visitors' IP addresses. We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a
visitor or member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is
necessary to enforce compliance with the Sites’ policies or to protect
the Company, the Sites, the Sites’ visitors, MyView, our Internet Service
Provider partners, the members or others.</p>
 
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
 
<p>Cookies
are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard
drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for a number of purposes: </p>
 
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">On Our Sites:&nbsp; </b>Most commonly, we use cookies to make
web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you’re using
our Sites.&nbsp; The use of cookies is an
industry standard -you'll find them at most websites. We use cookies on the
Sites to verify a member's login status. &nbsp;By showing how and when visitors use the
Sites, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not.
Information such as the total number of visitors to the Sites and pages viewed
is most easily tracked with cookies. We may use the information from cookies to
make improvements and updates to the Sites and to tailor our services to our
visitors', members' and survey participants' needs.&nbsp; </p>
 
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">For Banner
Ads:&nbsp; </b>When you visit
one of our Sites or take one of our surveys, without registering for MyView, we
may place cookies on your computer that alerts internet advertising networks
that you have visited one of our Sites or surveys.&nbsp;&nbsp; These cookies, which do not track
any personally-identifiable information, allows us to ask internet advertising
networks to serve you advertisements with respect to survey opportunities,
MyView and our Sites.&nbsp; </p>
 
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">For Brand
Awareness Studies:&nbsp; </b>We may place cookies
from a third party technology provider on your computer that signals when you
visit a website that utilizes a supported internet advertising network.&nbsp; We provide only limited non-personally
identifiable information to the third party technology provider, including
certain demographic information and a coded user identification number.&nbsp; The signal emitted from the cookie
includes solely the coded user identification number and the specific
advertisement(s) that you may have viewed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain of our clients may ask us
send you survey opportunities to determine the effectiveness of their internet advertising
based on the signals sent by the cookie about the advertising you may have
viewed.&nbsp; You may choose to opt-out
of receiving these brand awareness cookies at any time by clicking on the
following link: <a href="http://portal.myview.com/portal/app?cmd=OptOut&amp;_l=1">OPT OUT</a> .&nbsp; In the event you opt-out of receiving
these cookies, we will not longer place brand awareness cookies on your
system.&nbsp; As a registered member of
MyView, we will save this opt-out preference to your profile.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>By
your use of the Sites and MyView, you authorize cookies to be put in place and
their use by us and our clients and business partners consistent with the
disclosures above.&nbsp; The cookies will
expire after one year.&nbsp; </p>
 
<p>You
also always have the option of disabling the installation of new cookies and
deleting existing cookies using your browser preferences. Most browsers are
initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all
cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent and to accept/reject such
cookie(s) individually. However, please be aware that some features of the
Sites will not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.</p>
 
<p><b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons / Web Bugs)</b></p>
 
<p>Clear
gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast
to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are
embedded invisibly in HTML files and are about the size of the period at the
end of this sentence.</p>
 
<p>We
may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have
been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
communications. We may also use them to confirm payment to our third party
partners. If you no longer wish to receive our communications sent by email,
you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in
each communication.</p>
 
<p><b>Information
Sharing and Disclosure:</b></p>
 
<p>Except
for the situations listed here in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally
identifiable information with third parties. </p>
 
<p><b>Agents and Third Party Service Providers
and Partners</b></p>
 
<p>To
provide MyView to you, we may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain
specialized services such as data processing or other technology services. In
such instances, we may provide your personal information to those businesses,
but they are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other
purpose.</p>
 
<p><b>Digital Fingerprinting</b></p>
 
<p>We
may use digital fingerprinting technologies to assign a unique identifier or
“Machine-ID” to a user’s computer to identify and track the
computer. MyView works principally with a third party provider to deploy this
technology (the “Technology”) and does not use it to collect personally
identifiable information, or track the online activities, of the user of a
computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a
computer or alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of a
computer. We use the unique identifier to assist our clients in ensuring the
integrity of survey results. The third party provider analyzes publicly
available information and data obtained from the computer’s web browser
and from other publicly available data points, including without limitation the
technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and
the computer’s IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the
computer. The unique identifier is an alpha-numeric id. After creating the
unique identifier, we do not retain the information analyzed by the Technology
to create the unique identifier. &nbsp;Additionally, to assist our clients in
protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, we (a) may link or
associate your unique identifier to you and any of your personally identifiable
information; (b) may share your unique identifier with our clients and with
other sample or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a unique
identifier linked to you from a third party, including without limitation a
sample or panel provider or a client of MyView. Any unique identifier(s)
received or obtained by MyView and linked to a specific individual will be
protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
 
<p><b>Change of Control / Asset Transfer</b></p>
 
<p>As
the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all
or parts of our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the
business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that the
assets of the Company in whole or in parts are acquired by a third-party,
customer information, including any visitor information collected through the
Sites or MyView, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a
corporate change in control or sale of all or parts of our business assets our
users will be notified and given the opportunity to opt-out of any such
transfer of their personally identifiable information to the new corporate
entity or asset purchaser.</p>
 
<p><b>Legal and Site Compliance</b></p>
 
<p>The
Company reserves the right to disclose member information in special cases when
we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the
Company's rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that
could be harmed by such activities. The Company also reserves the right to
disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that
the law requires it.&nbsp; We may also
use personally identifiable information to monitor compliance with the
Sites’ Terms and Conditions.</p>
 
<p><b>Communications
From the Site:</b></p>
 
<p><b>Survey Electronic Notification</b></p>
 
<p>We
will send you targeted and relevant surveys by electronic notification (such
as, but not limited to, email, sms, social media, smart phones) as is necessary
to fulfill MyView to you.</p>
 
<p><b>Service Notification</b></p>
 
<p>We
will send you service-related announcements, which are not promotional in
nature, on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For example, if our service
is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you electronic
notification.</p>
 
<p><b>Customer Service</b></p>
 
<p>Based
upon the information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response
to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to fulfill incentive
requests, and to manage your account. We may communicate with you by electronic
communication or telephone.</p>
 
<p><b>Rights
Pertaining to Personal Information:</b></p>
 
<p>We
regularly send electronic notifications to the members of MyView.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you do not wish to receive them you
may opt-out and/or deactivate your account by following the instructions included
in each communication.</p>
 
<p><b>Security and
Information Protection:</b></p>
 
<p>The
security of your information is important to us. We follow generally accepted
industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during
transmission and once we receive it; however, no method of transmission over
the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive
to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
 
<p><b>Firewalls</b></p>
 
<p>Protecting
the security of your personal information is very important to us. When we
store information that you have provided to us when registering for MyView,
that information is protected by security measures that include
"firewalls" (a combination of computer hardware and software that
helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer
network), "intrusion detection systems" (a combination of computer
hardware and software that helps detect any unauthorized visitors) and other tools
such as data encryption and physical security, where appropriate.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Company strives to protect
your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the
security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be
responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your
personal information.</p>
 
<p><b>Links to other sites</b></p>
 
<p>Please
be aware that when you are on the Sites, or when you receive an email message
from us through MyView, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond
our control. There may be links to other sites from the Sites’ pages or
from the email message we send to you that take you outside our Sites. These
other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit
personal information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be
significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for
the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of
any of your personal information collected there. Note that when you link to a
third party site from the Sites, you may see pre-populated data fields with
your personal information; however, that information is not available to the
third party unless you take certain actions on the third party's site, such as
submitting a form.</p>
 
<p><b>Single Sign-On</b></p> 
<p>We use single sign-on service(s) that allow you to sign into MyView using your third-party 
social networking login credentials such as your Facebook or Twitter accounts. 
These services allow you to link your existing social network profile to your MyView account. 
Once linked, you will be able to post content on the third-party site from MyView and interact with your friends. 
If you choose to use such a sign-on service, MyView may also access certain profile information from your third-party social 
network profile such as friends, profile picture, etc.</p>




<p><b>Privacy Policy
for Children:</b></p>
 
<p>We
do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 on the
Sites or through the Service without permission from a parent or legal guardian.
If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any information to us. If
we become aware that we have collected information from a child under the age
of 13 without the permission of a parent or legal guardian, we will make
commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
 
<p><b>Changes to this
Policy:</b></p>
 
<p>The
terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you
of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the
homepage of the Sites for a reasonable period of time after such changes are
made, that this Privacy Policy has been updated, and by changing the
"Effective" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you
to check this page periodically for any changes. </p>

policy, please send them to the Authentic Response Privacy office at <a href="mailto:privacy@myview.com">privacy@myview.com</a>, or contact:</p>
