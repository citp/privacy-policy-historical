  1. _Right of access_

You have a right to know whether we are processing your personal information.

  2. _Right to rectification_

You have the right to require us to rectify or complete any inaccurate or incomplete personal information that we are holding about you. 

  3. _Right to erasure_

You have a right to ask us to erase your personal information. This is also known as the “right to be forgotten”. We must erase your personal information following your request except in limited circumstances prescribed by law, such as where we need to retain your personal information in order to comply with a legal obligation or in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. In these circumstances, we will restrict our processing of your personal information by putting it “beyond use”. This means that your personal information is deleted from our website and retained only in a separate and restricted database, where it will not be processed for any purpose other than as detailed above. Access to this database is managed by our DPO and is strictly limited. 

  4. _Right to restriction of processing_

You have a right to require us to restrict processing of your personal information where: -

    1. you believe that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate and we require reasonable time to verify the accuracy of that personal information; 
    2. your personal information has been unlawfully processed by us but you do not want us to erase that personal information; 
    3. it is no longer necessary for us to keep your personal information for the purposes for which they were collected by us but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
    4. you exercise your right to object to processing and we require reasonable time to verify whether there are any overriding grounds upon which we may rely in order to continue that processing.

  5. _Right to data portability_

If we process your personal information with your consent or because it is necessary for us to do so in order to provide our service to you, you may require us to move, copy or transfer that personal information to you or another third party in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

  6. _Right to object_

You have a right to object to our processing of your personal information where we are processing that personal information on legitimate interest grounds. We will stop processing this personal information if you exercise your right to object unless there are overriding grounds upon which we may rely in order to continue that processing or unless that processing is necessary in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

You also have a right to object to our processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. We will stop processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes if you request us to do so.

  7. _Right to withdraw consent_
