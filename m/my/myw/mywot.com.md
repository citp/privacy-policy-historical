# Privacy | WOT Web of Trust

## We care about your privacy

Your privacy is very important to us. The WOT add-on collects information only for computing website ratings, performing statistical analysis, and preventing abuse of our service. Any information that is no longer needed for these purposes is deleted.

## What information do we collect?

The add-on uses cookies to authenticate itself to the My WOT portal. Cookies don't store any personally identifying information, such as your name or email address. You can also disable the cookies from the add-on preferences if you prefer. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to use certain parts of the WOT services or certain functions and features of the WOT software.

When loading reputations for the websites you visit, the add-on sends our service only the encrypted hostname and any ratings you may choose to give. The information about the domains visited is stored only temporarily for computing ratings. However, Against Intuition may retain statistical and background information (containing no personal information).

If you choose to register with the My WOT portal, we require some personal information. We ask for your name, a nickname, an email address, a username, and a password (which you can choose yourself). This information is stored in a secure database, and your password is processed such that it cannot be recovered. If you participate in a discussion forum or leave feedback about a website, we'll show your nickname next to your comments and feedback.

## Why do we collect information?

The information we collect when you install the WOT add-on is used to identify you as a unique user. Without this information we would not be able to rely on your ratings and therefore could not provide the service to our user community. The information the My WOT portal collects is used for your convenience and for statistical purposes. For example, if you forget your password, we can help you create a new one and guide you through this via email. Background information such as age or gender is used to provide statistical information about website preferences. This statistical information is stored without any personal information.
