# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: **Aug 7, 2015**

  


* * *

At Mindspark, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes the practices concerning the information collected by the Mindspark family of companies consisting of Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. and IAC Search and Media Europe Limited (“Mindspark”, "we", "us" and "our") through the use of the (i) websites and applications, e.g. tool bars, content, products, forums and services controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. (the “MS Products”) and (ii) our "Search Applications" made available by means of a search box on a MS Product or website from which you can access our search services. These Search Applications are controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. for users in the United States and Asia Pacific region and by our Irish affiliate, IAC Search and Media Europe Limited, for users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific region. Collectively, we refer to the MS Products and these Search Applications in this Privacy Policy as the “MS Services”.

Mindspark respects the privacy of users of the MS Services, and has developed this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the MS Services, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. 

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the MS Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us. Certain MS Services may be subject to different privacy policies and/or terms of service as indicated on the sites from where those services are available and/ or accessed. 

A. Search services

The Search Applications provide features to facilitate Internet search and communication services using the MS Products including through the MyWay and MyWebSearch portals and email. This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings and “extensions” that set or default your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which MS Product you are using and what options you select. If you do not wish to reset your setting(s) in this way, you can decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for the relevant MS Product that provides access to the Search Applications. Certain MS Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the store’s requirements. The search features, as well as other non-search-related features, may be customized by you. In addition, you can disable or remove the default search features by removing or disabling the applicable files you downloaded from the MS Products, or changing your default search within your browser, depending on your browser, browser version, and tools and features provided in your respective browser. Click here to go to [our support page](http://support.mindspark.com/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?deptID=30031&task=knowledge&questionID=1552).

In some MS Products the Search Applications are provided by Ask under the Ask brand in which case the relevant Ask Privacy Policy applies. This is available [here](http://about.uk.ask.com/about/terms_conditions/privacy.html) for European residents and users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, and [here](http://about.ask.com/privacy-policy/) for users in the United States and the Asia Pacific Region. 

B. Information we collect

We may collect information from you that may identify you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number and anonymous Information, such as the number of your page views, link clicks, and login times. Your information may be kept in an identifiable format, or in an aggregate format which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it.

C. How we collect information

We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on the MS Services: 

  1. Information you provide to us. We may collect and store any information you provide when using the MS Services (e.g. when registering on the MyWay Site) or in some other manner, including an email address, username and password. When we provide you with an email inbox as part of an MS Product, we may monitor and collect the contents of such emails in the course of normal maintenance of the relevant MS Product and its systems. Further, in order to permit us to protect the quality of our products and services, we may to the extent permitted by applicable law access your account and records on a case by case basis to investigate complaints or other allegations.
  2. Automatically Captured Information. We automatically collect information from your computer and/or device when you use the MS Services. This information may include your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the keyword query, search query text, search results clicked, pages viewed, search history, the content of any undeleted cookies (see section D on "Cookies" below), software installed upon and/or devices connected to your computer and/or device, and the referring website address.
  3. Other Technologies. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the MS Services. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embeded in images on the pages of sites. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer as part of the MS Services for our users. 
  4. Information collected by third-parties. We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, IAC affiliates, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements or place ad tags or beacons on or via MS Services. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. We may also use information collected by these third-parties to better understand our own users, their interests, and how they use our products. Please note, some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.

  5. Do not track signals.

L. Requests to remove search results pursuant to european court of justice ruling

Following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), users of our European web search and reference services who are EU residents may request that certain results do not appear following a web search for the user’s name. 

If you would like to request the removal of a search result generated using your name as the search term, please send your request in writing to IAC Search and Media Europe, Ltd at the address below. To assist us in processing your request in timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so. Your request should include any information relevant to your request, including: (i) your name, email and postal address; (ii) the URL (i.e., “web address”) for each link that you are requesting to be removed; (iii) a brief explanation of why you believe such results should be removed; (iv) an explanation of whether or not you fulfil a role in public life; and (v) an explanation as to why the contents of the link you wish to have removed relate to you. 

To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document; a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. You may also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you. If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain photographs of you, please ensure that the identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by IAC Search and Media Europe Limited’s legal and compliance team in Ireland and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws and considering the balance between the user’s right to privacy and the public’s interest in access to information, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.
