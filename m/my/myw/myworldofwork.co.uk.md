To meet confidentiality requirements for our customers, stakeholders and staff, Skills Development Scotland has Confidentiality, Data Protection, Information Technology and Systems Policies in place and we ensure that staff are fully aware of these and the associated guidance in relation to your personal information.

We’ll hold the personal information you give us as part of your account for as long as you are using an account with us.

  * We may close your account if you haven’t used it in the last 5 years. We’ll send you an email to tell you that we plan to do this before we delete anything, so please check to see if we’ve sent you any emails about this
  * If you delete your account, then your personal information will be deleted, and the remaining information made anonymous. We might then use it to help us improve our services.
