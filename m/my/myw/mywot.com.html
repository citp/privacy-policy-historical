The WOT services, offered through our website [https://www.mywot.com/](/) as well as our desktop and mobile browser extensions and apps (the “WOT Products”) and our online forum and community platform (collectively, the “WOT Services”), involve the collection and analysis of a great deal of data necessary for the supply of the WOT Services.\n\n\nThis policy (our “Privacy Policy”) is intended to make our users fully aware of the data we collect, the way it is stored, used, and shared, and our users’ rights in relation to such data and practices.  We greatly value our users and their privacy rights, and we encourage all of our users to read and become familiar with this Privacy Policy so that they may understand those rights and how to protect them.  Use of the WOT Services is subject to the WOT Terms of Use, available at [https://www.mywot.com/en/terms](/terms) and the WOT Community Guidelines, available at [https://www.mywot.com/en/guidelines](/guidelines).  This Privacy Policy is part of the WOT Terms of Use.\n\n\nBy installing any WOT Products and/or using any of the WOT Services, you acknowledge our collection, storage, use and sharing of your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. **IF YOU OBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WOT PRODUCTS OR WOT SERVICES.**\n\n\n- [Information We Collect](#information-we-collect)\n- [How We Use the Data](#how-we-use-the-data)\n- [Sharing Collected Data with Third Parties](#sharing-collected-data-with-third-parties)\n- [Cookies & Third-Party Tools](#cookies-&-third-party-tools)\n- [Do Not Track Disclosure](#do-not-track-disclosure)\n- [Your Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#your-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)\n- [Data Transfers, Storage and Security](#data-transfers-storage-and-security)\n- [Data Retention](#data-retention)\n- [Your Rights](#your-rights)\n- [Minors](#minors)\n- [Third-Party Links](#third-party-links)\n- [Updates & Revisions](#updates-&-revisions)\n- [Any Questions/Suggestions](#any-questionssuggestions)\n\n"},"Information We Collect":{"raw":"We may collect from and about you both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, as follows:\n\n\n**Information You Provide Directly** – We may collect information directly from you, including information that identifies or can readily be used to identify an individual (referred to herein as “Personal Information”). This information that we collect directly from you includes:\n\n\n- Registration Information – You may choose to become an active member of the WOT community and register as a WOT user. Among other things, this will allow you to join and participate in our forums, share your experience, contribute your comments and otherwise take part in group discussions with other WOT users. You may register with us directly through [https://www.mywot.com/en/signup](/signup). Registration instructions are provided in our Terms of Use. If you do choose to register, then we will collect from you certain registration information including your name, email address, user name and password. In addition, once you have registered, you may choose to enter certain information about you in your user profile. All of this data, including Personal Information, we receive in relation to your registration is referred to herein as “Registration Information”.  **Note that registration is not mandatory and you may use the WOT Products and WOT Services without registration.**\n- Customer Support Information – You may voluntarily provide us with information when you contact us for customer support, such as your name and email address. We will use any Personal Information received for customer support purposes to communicate with and support you, and we will not share it with any third parties, except as reasonably necessary to provide customer support.\n- User-Generated Content – Content provided by you and other users of the WOT Services, for purposes of sharing with other members of the WOT community, through our forums or otherwise, is referred to as “User-Generated Content” and may include Personal Information, such as your name, if you include such information with your User-Generated Content.\n\n**Information from Third Parties** – We may also receive Registration Information about you if you register through a social network (e.g. Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and others). This Registration Information may include any information (such as profile picture, public and basic information, status and photos) as provided by you to the applicable social network operator, and which such social network operator permits to be shared with third parties. The data we receive from your social network operator depends on your privacy settings with the social network operator, and we will not post information about you on third party social media sites without your consent. You should review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the WOT Products or WOT Service.\n\n\n**Automatically Collected Information** – When you install and use the WOT app or WOT extension, we also collect from you automatically, and where applicable through the Android accessibility services feature, information related to your use of the WOT Services and your web browsing activity. This information may include, without limitation, the following:\n\n\n- From WOT desktop/mobile extension and desktop app - Internet Protocol Address (trimmed to permanently remove specific location information other than country, city & postal code); device type; operating system and browser; TabID; Search engine results page (keyword, order/index of results, link of result, title, description, ads); web pages visited and time stamp of the visit; display ads; and WOT user ID.\n- From WOT mobile app – Internet Protocol Address (trimmed to permanently remove specific location information other than country, city & postal code); device information (device model name, device ID (permanently and irreversibly encrypted), OS version, whether device is rooted, screen size); information about installed apps (name, id, type, install date, update date, version, time used, whether on home page); applications web connections; and browsing information (browser, web pages visited and time stamp of the visit).\n\nIn addition, if you register and use our website to rate and/or provide comments on a website, your Internet Protocol Address is automatically collected. Some of this automatically collected information may be considered “Non-Personal Information,” which is anonymous, aggregated or de-identified information that is not collected together, or otherwise associated by us, with any Registration Information or other Personal Information, if any, that we hold about you. When we automatically collect information, we go to great lengths to make sure that Non-Personal Information remains anonymous, as further described below.\n\n\n"},"How We Use the Data":{"raw":"WOT uses the information collected from or about our users for analytical, operational and business purposes in the following ways:\n\n\n- to provide and operate the WOT Services for our community of users, including the display of safety and reputation data about websites you visit;\n- to further develop and improve the functionality and features of the WOT Services;\n- to analyze how you interact with the WOT Services, including to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends, and for other research, analytical, and statistical purposes;\n- with respect to Registration Information and Customer Support Information, to provide our users access to our user forums, customer and technical support, to respond to user inquiries, and to notify our users of WOT updates and promotions;\n- to enforce the Terms of Service, to prevent misuse of the WOT Services and unlawful activities by WOT users, and to take any necessary action in the event of a dispute regarding use of the WOT Services; and\n- to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, or requests from government agencies or legal authorities.\n\nOur use of your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information will be based on (a) our legitimate interests in enhancing, improving and promoting the WOT Services and our other services and products; or (b) where allowed under applicable law, the implied consent you provide by using the WOT Services or by contacting us in order to address a specific request.\n\n\nWOT goes to great lengths, and invests substantial resources, to avoid disclosing Personal Information.
