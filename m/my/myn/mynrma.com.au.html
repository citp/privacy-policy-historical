<p>Protecting the information of members and other users of our website is important to us. Any information collected is held in strictest confidence.</p>
<p><b>What information is collected on the website? Can I use the website anonymously?</b></p>
<p>Yes you can use the website anonymously. The type of information we can collect depends on how you use this web site. If you visit our website to read or download information only, our system will record the date and time that the site was accessed and the information viewed or downloaded.</p>

<p>You can feel confident that when you deal with us online, we have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information will not be used in anyway that you did not intend it to be used. Your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our servers. Encryption makes it exceedingly difficult for others to view your information. This web site uses a 128 bit Secure Socket Layer encryption.</p>
<p>We also monitor developments in security and encryption technologies, and we review and update our processes and procedures in line with industry standards. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as fully secure. We do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<p>Once we receive your information, we make all efforts to protect the data held in our system against misuse, loss and unauthorised access. If we no longer need your information, we will destroy or de-identify it.</p>

<p><strong>What are cookies and do you use them?</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer hard drive by a web page server. Cookies may then be accessed later by our web servers. Cookies store information about your use of our web site.</p>
<p>We use cookies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>determine if you have previously visited the NRMA Motoring &amp; Services website; </li>
<li>identify what pages from our website that you have accessed; and 
</li><li>store your TravelWiz Backpack information. </li></ul>

If your browser is set to reject cookies you may not be able to make full use of our web site or access services on the site that require cookies in order for you to participate.</p>
<p>If you clear your cookies or do not access your Backpack for 12 months, your Backpack information will no longer be available.</p>
<p>Your Backpack information is not kept or accessed by NRMA.</p>
<p><strong>When I connect to another web site from your web site does this privacy and security statement still apply?</strong></p>
<p>No. When you use a link from our website to other websites, including NRMA Insurance Limited, those websites are not subject to our privacy policy statement. You will need to contact those websites to find out about their privacy and security policies.</p>
<p><strong>What if this privacy and security statement changes?</strong></p>
<p>This privacy and security statement sets out our current website privacy and security policies. We may change these policies from time to time. We will notify you of these changes by publishing them on this website - we will not separately notify you of these changes. You should check this statement from time to time. By continuing to use this website, you are agreeing to accept any changes we make.</p>
