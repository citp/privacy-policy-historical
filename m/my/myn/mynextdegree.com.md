**Privacy Policy**

At this web site, operated by My Next Degree, we care about your privacy. This policy describes what information we collect and how we use it. 

**Website Data**  
When you browse through our site, we collect information on the efficiency and working of our Web site. This information includes your IP address, the number of times a web page is accessed, the browser used, and paths taken through the website, and search terms entered to find our site. We keep this information for an indefinite time to improve the operation of our site and serve users better. **Contact Information**  
We also collect personal contact information if you enter it when requesting information from a school.  This contact information is stored on our servers and shared with the schools you identify (sometimes through a vendor that is under contract to the school), so that they may contact you with more information. Personally Identifiable Contact Information is not sold to third parties except as explicitly required to fulfill your information request, or if you have requested to receive additional offers from us or our advertising partners. **Cookies**  
Our website uses cookies (small files on your computer), to provide usage statistics about our web site, and to understand where visitors find out about our web site. We also may use cookies to simplify re-entering your data. **Contacting You**  
Different schools have different methods of following up with student information requests. Some will send you brochures in the mail, others will reply via email or telephone. By using our service to request information from schools, you are giving permission to schools (or their partners or vendors) to contact you using the method of their choice, to fulfill your information request, notwithstanding your possible listing in the National Do-Not-Call Registry. 

My Next Degree reserves the right to contact you in the future to help improve our operations or to introduce new services, such as surveys to ensure that schools have followed up with your information requests in a timely manner.
