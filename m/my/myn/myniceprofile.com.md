# Privacy Policy | MyNiceProfile.com

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

We only collect information that you yourself provide when you wish to contact us. When you contact us, you yourself provide an e-mail address and name that is meant for response purpose only. We do not house or collect this information.

From time to time, we will use the data that our web server has collected to better serve our visitors. These data do not include any of your personal information such as name, age, where you live, your phone number, or social security number. We do not have the resources or power to collect these unwanted items. We only collect information that is naturally provided by the web server logging facilities such as number of unique visitors, page views and demographics. However we will not sell or grant access to this information to any third party.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this web site in order to provide advertisements on this site about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

If you have any questions regarding your privacy please [contact us](http://www.myniceprofile.com/feedback).
