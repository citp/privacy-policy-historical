# Privacy Policy - MyNewsLA.com

MyNewsLA.com and its owner CalNews Inc. recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about our readers and advertisers. In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information with your reasonable expectations of privacy.

MyNewsLA.com does not collect personally identifying information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by those individuals, such as to subscribe to our email newsletters, or to register for a contest or promotion.

Web servers hosting MyNewsLA.com automatically collect anonymous information about which pages you visit, your browser type, IP address,  domain name, interaction with advertising and other data. This is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We also provide this information about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

MyNewsLA.com collects this information by saving a data “cookie” to the browser cache of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a website. We use the information  track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site without compromising privacy. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don’t see the same ad too many times.

Advertising that is part of a network advertising service that collects information about a consumer’s online activities on a website over time and across different websites is identified by a small Ad Choices symbol. This symbol is part of the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can click the symbol for information about why and how you are receiving a particular ad, and the effect of your choice to allow or not allow tracking for targeted ads. For more information see [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

Note that due to inconsistent and changing technology we cannot always honor a browser’s Do Not Track signal. You may opt-out of a network advertising service ad by changing your cookie settings.
