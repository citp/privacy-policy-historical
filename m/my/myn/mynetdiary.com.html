            <h1>MyNetDiary Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    MyNetDiary.com understands the importance of privacy to our users.  This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and web sites offered by MyNetDiary.com.  Where additional detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process personal information.  This Privacy Policy will tell you what information MyNetDiary.com collects about you and about your use of MyNetDiary.com and its services.  We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
    By using MyNetDiary.com and our web sites, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our web site.  Your continued use of our web site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes.
    </p>

    <h2> Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <h4>General</h4>
    <p>
    MyNetDiary.com collects personal information when you visit MyNetDiary.com web pages and when you open an account with MyNetDiary.com or use other MyNetDiary.com products or services. MyNetDiary.com may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.  We use information for the following general purposes: providing products and services, billing, identification and authentication, improving our services and web site, and contacting users and research.  We aggregate certain information to develop statistics related to the use of MyNetDiary.com.  We may publish some statistics based on aggregated information, but none of these statistics will contain any personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you register to open an account with MyNetDiary.com, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, weight and height.  To purchase certain products and services from MyNetDiary.com, we also ask you to provide other contact and billing information.  MyNetDiary.com shares personally identifiable information only when required to complete your order.  We do not otherwise share personally identifiable information with any third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
    Depending on the product or service you have selected, we may also collect certain personal information, including personal foods, activities and body measurements.  Recognizing the highly personal nature of this information, we take special precautions to protect such information.
    </p>

    <h4>Credit Card Information</h4>
    <p>
    We use PayPal to process credit card transactions.  You may choose to pay for your MyNetDiary.com account using any payment method accepted by PayPal.  If you use PayPal to make a payment, we do not receive or store any credit card information.  You may also choose to enter credit card information on MyNetDiary.com.  If you provide your credit card information on our web site, we will store such information for the duration of the transaction until your credit card is charged and the requested product or service has been purchased.  After the transaction is complete, we delete your credit card number and expiration date from our database.  For convenience, we may store your billing address for use during future transactions.
    </p>

    <h4>Referrals</h4>
    <p>
    If you choose to use our referral service, we will ask you to provide an email address for the person you choose to refer.  This email address is stored for the sole purpose of crediting your account when such person opens a new account with MyNetDiary.com and, if requested by you, for sending a one-time email to such individual upon making the referral.  We will not use this email address for any other purposes and will not share it with any third parties.
    </p>

    <h4>Message Boards and Other Public Forums</h4>
    <p>
    As a service to our users, MyNetDiary.com features message boards, online discussions, group and personal messages, and other public forums where users can share information or post questions for experts to answer.  We offer certain online discussions moderated by dietitians and other health professionals.  Any information (including personal information) that you reveal in a message board, online discussion, group or personal message, or other public forum is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service.  You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum.  What you have disclosed in such locations may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.  As with any public forum on any site, this information may also appear in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Children</h4>
    <p>
    MyNetDiary.com is committed to protecting the privacy of children.  The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use and disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.  Neither MyNetDiary.com nor any of its services or products are designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13.  We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.  COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents or guardians before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13.
    </p>
    <p>
    In compliance with COPPA, a parent or guardian may request to review, delete or stop the collection of personally identifiable information relating to their child or any child in their legal custody who is under the age of 13.  Parents or guardians may review, delete or stop the collection of personally identifiable information by contacting us by letter, phone or email using the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
    A parent or guardian may use MyNetDiary.com to establish an account for a minor.  The parent or guardian is solely responsible for providing supervision of the minor's use of MyNetDiary.com.  The parent or guardian assumes full responsibility for ensuring that the registration information is kept secure and that the information submitted is accurate.  The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through MyNetDiary.com for the minor.
