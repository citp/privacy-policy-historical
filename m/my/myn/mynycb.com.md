Our online services are NOT intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent.

If you have a financial product or service with us, we will use and share any information that we collect from or about you in accordance with our [Consumer Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/Documents/Privacy%20Policy.pdf "Consumer Privacy Notice"), which gives you certain choices with respect to the use and sharing of your personal information.

 **Information We Collect**  
Personal Information.  When you visit or use our online services, we may collect personal information from or about you such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number(s), account number, user name and password. We may also collect information about your third party accounts, social security number, driver’s license number and other data when you provide such information to apply for an account and/or use the Site and other online services and such collection is reasonably required for ordinary business purposes.

Other Information and its Usage.   In addition to the personal information described above, we or our third party partners may collect certain information about your use of our online services. For example, we may capture certain location information (a zip code used in an ATM or branch locator), the IP address of the device you use to connect to the online service, the type of web browser you use, information about the last web site you came from before visiting the Site, and the parts of the Site you access during your visit. We or our third-party partners may also use cookies, web beacons or other technologies to collect and store other information about your visit to, or use of, the Site and our other online services. We may later associate the usage and other information we collect online with personal information we may have about you.

NYCB Mobile.  For your convenience, NYCB enables you to access certain products and services through downloadable mobile applications and websites designed for access via a web browser used on a wireless device (“NYCB Mobile”). When you use NYCB Mobile, we may collect information such as unique device identifiers for your mobile device, your screen resolution and other device settings, information about your location, and analytical information about how you use your mobile device. We may include certain permissions for NYCB Mobile, including seeking permission to collect information about the geographic location of the mobile device you are using to access NYCB Mobile.

Additional Sources of Information.   We also may collect information about you from additional online and offline sources, including co-branded web sites we may operate with partners or third-party commercial sources, such as credit reporting agencies. We may combine this information with the personal and other information we have collected about you under this Online Privacy Statement.

 **How We Use the Information**

We may use your personal information for a variety of reasons, including the following:

  * to respond to your inquiries and/or requests
  * to process applications and transactions
  * to verify your identity in order to allow access to your account(s)
  * to provide you with relevant information and promotions about products and services

**Cookies**  
You can control whether or not to accept cookies. A ‘ **cookie** ’ is a small text file that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a web site. The file uniquely identifies a browser/computer and information stored in a cookie sent by a NYCB web page can only be read by NYCB (or a company we work with). You can modify your browser setting to either notify you when you receive a cookie so you can choose whether or not to accept it or set your browser to not accept cookies automatically. If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on the Site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account(s). 

**Web Site Tracking**  
We try and place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to our customers. Third party companies we work with may place and track our advertisements on third-party websites. As there is no technical standard for how Do Not Track consumer browser settings should work on commercial websites, the marketing industry has undertaken certain self-regulatory initiatives to provide consumers with a choice of the types of ads they may see online and to enable them to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all of the companies participating in these programs reasonably conveniently. Because of the absence of such technical standards, we cannot ensure that the Site will respond to Do Not Track consumer browser settings in any particular instance.  

If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by visiting the Network Advertising Alliance (“NAI”) site at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. This will not avoid you from seeing any ads, but will avoid having any relate to your interests as determined during your web browsing. The NAI web site also offers a tool that identifies its member companies that have placed cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies. Please note that network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement.

 **Security**  
Protecting your information is a priority of NYCB. We protect your information with reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with Federal standards. For more information about our commitment to security and for tips about what you can do to help guard against fraud and identity theft, visit our [Security Center](https://web.archive.org/Pages/SecurityCenter.aspx "Security Center Link").

**Accuracy of Information**  
Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is important. You may review or update certain information by logging on to NYCB Online. You may also contact us by using the Customer Service option on our website or you may contact your local branch.
