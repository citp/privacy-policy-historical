VENDORS

There have been recent incidents of personal data loss involving both government and commercial entities. Accordingly, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of the Navy (DoN) have taken action to mitigate these losses, such as training all DoD and DoN personnel on basic DoD Privacy Act compliance requirements. Recently, DoD and DoN have added the requirement that all who do business with DoD and DoN (including all contractors and vendors) understand that:

  *  The collection of personal data is limited under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552A) to information relevant and necessary to accomplish a DoD/DoN purpose set forth in Law or regulation, and that dissemination of personal data except with consent of individual involved is prohibited;
  * The willful disclosure of personal information, unless authorized by applicable law or regulation, is subject to criminal prosecution; and;


  * Contractors/vendors and their employees are stewards of personal information in their possession and that they have an affirmative responsibility to ensure personal information is collected, maintained, used, and disseminated only as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and for continually safeguarding such information (i.e., treating and protecting as if their own).
  * All contractors who have potential access to PII must also complete the PII training and have a record of completion on file. Contractors are subject to the same provisions as Federal employees and military members under the Privacy Act.



A business partner (contractor, vendor, and all employees, representatives, subcontractors, etc.), that conducts official business in any capacity with NEXCOM involving receiving or obtaining information subject to safeguarding requirements of the Privacy Act, shall ensure full compliance with the Privacy Act at all times. For additional guidance, see the DoN Chief Information Officer website   <<http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=1876>>.
