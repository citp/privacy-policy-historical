Thank you for taking the time to visit New York Community Bank's web site. The Internet offers the safe &amp; convenient new ways to shop for financial services and conduct banking business, any day, at any time. However, we understand that you may be concerned about the privacy of information you provide to us or that is generated as a result of your visit. Be assured that we are committed to your financial well-being and to protecting the privacy and security of your confidential information. To address these issues, New York Community Bank has instituted the following Privacy Policy.

</p><p><b>Your Personal Information: </b>
<br>Personal Information includes all of the information you provide us both electronically and in hard copy. Information is collected when you bank online or offline, use our online bill paying services, apply for products and services, send us an email or use various calculators, planners or questionnaires on our web site. This information may include: your name; address; Social Security number; assets and income; products you are interested in or use; your transactions with us, such as your account balance and loan payment history; information received from consumer reporting agencies, such as your creditworthiness and credit history; your email address, Internet service provider, the web browser you use, and the content of any sent or received cookie.</p>

<p><b>Privacy Protection Of Personal Information </b>
<br>Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our customer's personal information is important to us. We value your business and the trust you put in us. To offer you the financial products and services you request, we gather, maintain, and use information about you on a routine basis. To assist you better in understanding how your personal information is utilized, we are providing you with the following statements describing our policies and practices with respect to the sharing of customer information. In the event that you terminate your customer relationship with us, or become an inactive customer, our privacy policy will continue to apply to you.</p>

<p><b>What Information Do We Collect? </b>
<br>We collect both public and non-public personal information about you on applications or other forms during the application or account opening process, gathered from your transactions and experiences with us or our affiliates and obtained from other authorized sources, such as consumer reporting agencies. Non-public information means personally identifiable financial information and any lists, descriptions or any groupings derived using personally identifiable financial information that is not publicly available. All information collected and stored by New York Community Bank is used for specific business purposes, such as administering your account, complying with federal and state laws and regulations, protecting against fraud, and developing a better understanding of your financial needs to provide you with improved products and services. </p>

<p><b>Our Use of Your Personal Information:</b> 
<br>New York Community Bank will use the information obtained about you to properly identify you, to maintain accurate account balance information, and to help us provide you with efficient customer service and the products and services you request. This information also assists us in designing and improving our products and services to address your specific needs.</p>

<p>We may disclose some information about you to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements to provide products and services that we do not offer. Companies that perform business operations for us, such as check printing, are only provided with the information necessary for them to perform the specific function. New York Community Bank is extremely selective in choosing and contracting with these second parties and requires them to adhere to the same privacy and security standards as we do. </p>

<p>We may disclose some information about you to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements to provide products and services that we do not offer. Companies that perform business operations for us, such as check printing, are only provided with the information necessary for them to perform the specific function. New York Community Bank is extremely selective in choosing and contracting with these second parties and requires them to adhere to the same privacy and security standards as we do.</p> 
We also will release information about you when legally required to do so (i.e., in response to a subpoena or court order) or to prevent fraud. 

<p><b>Security of Your Personal Information: </b>
<br>New York Community Bank continually updates and improves the physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards required to comply with all federal, state and industry standards to protect the security of your personal information. </p>

<p>All employees are required to agree in writing to protect the confidentiality of customer data and to use it only for Bank purposes. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. </p>

<p>The Internet is a public network. Therefore, it is important to learn how you can safeguard your banking information, credit card numbers, Social Security number and other personal data and, to learn about, and take advantage of security features.</p> 

<p>Some examples are: Encryption is the process of scrambling private information to prevent unauthorized access. To show that your transmission is encrypted, some browsers display a small icon on your screen that looks like a "lock" or a "key" whenever you conduct secure transactions online. Avoid sending sensitive information, such as account numbers, through unsecured e-mail. Passwords, access codes or personal identification numbers (PINs) should be used when accessing an account online. Your password should be unique to you and you should change it regularly. Do not use birth dates or other numbers or words that may be easy for others to guess. Always carefully control to whom you give your password. General security over your personal computer such as virus protection and physical access controls should be used and updated regularly. Contact your hardware and software suppliers or Internet service provider to ensure that you have the latest in security updates. </p>

<p><b>What Information Do We Disclose? </b>
<br>We do not disclose any public or non-public information about our customers or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law. We do not sell any customer information to anyone. We are permitted under law to disclose such information about you to other third parties when requested by an account holder, a legal representative, or in certain circumstances. For example, we disclose non-public personal information about you to third parties to assist us in servicing your loan or account with us, to government entities and third parties in response to subpoenas and to consumer reporting agencies. We may also disclose information we collect, as described above, to nonaffiliated third parties that perform account administration services or functions on our behalf, marketing services on our behalf, to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, and for other reasons allowed by law. We may also disclose certain non-public financial information we collect with our affiliates, such as CFS Investments, Inc., for the purpose of providing you with information about additional products and services that may benefit you.</p> 

<p><b>Information We May Disclose In The Future </b>
<br>We reserve the right to disclose public and non-public personal information we collect on customers or former customers with non-affiliated third party companies at some time in the future. Such third parties might include financial service providers, retail businesses that we partner with or other businesses that we believe can provide beneficial products or services to you. </p>

<p><b>Links to Other Sites: </b>
<br>As an added convenience to our customers, we may offer online links to merchants, retail stores, travel agents and other non-financial sites. Please remember that an outside Web site may not be secure and the company's products and services are not insured by the FDIC. We cannot guarantee your privacy or the products and services. As in everyday business, before you order a product or service online, make sure you are comfortable with the reputation of the company making the offer. Only then should you release any personal information such as your account number, Social Security Number or credit card or CheckCard number. </p>

<p><b>Children's Information: </b>
<br>New York Community Bank makes every effort to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information from customers under the age of 13. </p>

<p><b>Maintaining the Accuracy of Your Information: </b>
<br>New York Community Bank has procedures in place to ensure that your personal information is accurately recorded and maintained and that any inaccurate or incomplete information is corrected in a timely manner.</p>

<p>If you have any reason to believe that your personal information is incorrect, please e-mail us at info@mynycb.com or call New York Community Bank at (516) 683-4408. </p>

<p><b>Your Right To Opt-Out </b>
<br>If you prefer that New York Community Bank not share certain non-public personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties, you may restrict information sharing (other than those disclosures permitted by law). Such an election means you "opt out" of information sharing. This will not preclude our continued sharing of public and non-public personal information as permitted by law. The Fair Credit Reporting Act also allows you to opt out from New York Community Bank sharing non-transaction or other information (such as consumer credit report information) with affiliates. Your election to opt out will apply to all products and services you obtain within the New York Community Bank Family of Banks and affiliated entities for personal, family or household purposes. If you have a joint account with one or more other individuals, an opt out sent by any one individual will cause that account to be identified as an opt out account. Remember that if you choose to opt out you may not receive certain information on products or services that may be of interest to you. </p>

<p>To opt out, please <a href="documents/Optoutform.pdf">download the opt out panel</a>. Fill it out and mail to the address indicated.</p> 

<p><b>Please Note</b>: Only deposit accounts offered through New York Community Bank are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage. Non-deposit investment and insurance products, such as mutual funds, stocks, annuities and life insurance policies that may be sold through this Web site or at a Bank branch location, are not FDIC-insured, are not guaranteed by the Bank, and may lose value.</p>
