3\. Why we collect personal information 

Generally, we collect and use personal information about Members and customers to establish Memberships and provide a range of products, services and benefits to Members and customers relating to their motoring and related lifestyle needs. 

We also collect personal information to assist in identifying ways in which we can serve you better, such as providing our products and services to you more effectively, and to assist our internal administration and operations including accounting, risk management, record keeping, archiving, systems development and testing, and staff training. 

Some of the information we collect is for the purpose of improving our interaction with Members and their involvement in the NRMA Group. 

We collect personal information about third parties, including family members, for purposes in relation to yours and their dealings (either directly or indirectly) with the NRMA Group. These purposes include providing secondary Membership cards and Gift Memberships and for the purposes set out above. 

Members who nominate an additional cardholder or provide personal information about a third party individual need to ensure that those persons are aware of this Privacy Statement, understand it and agree to accept it. If that individual does not have the capacity to understand and agree to these terms, NRMA requires a parent or guardian to give the assurances set out in this paragraph. 

### 4\. How we collect information 

Generally, we collect personal information directly from you, such as when you apply for Membership or request a product or service, in the course of providing you with that product or service (eg: Roadside Assistance), or when you have other dealings with us. 

We may collect and update that information over the phone, at roadside, over the Internet, in person (when you visit us at an NRMA office), when you write to us or if you participate in our marketing campaigns. We may also collect personal information through third parties such as:

Additionally we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it. We impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on all third parties as to how they store, handle and deal with your personal information.
