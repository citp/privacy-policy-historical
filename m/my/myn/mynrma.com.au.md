**Commitment to privacy and responsible use of information**  
Privacy of members and our customers is of utmost importance to the National Roads and Motorists' Association Limited. This includes information or opinions about members and customers that we collect and record and which could be used to reasonably identify them.

We view privacy as a serious matter and we strictly adhere to the National Privacy Principles and the Privacy Act 1988. Privacy safeguards are also featured in our Service Charter to members.

This Privacy Policy Statement sets out our policies on how we manage personal information across our business and includes NRMA Open Road Pty Ltd ABN 91 000 026 844, publisher of The Open Road magazine.

**Type of personal information we collect**  
The kind of information we collect generally includes your name, address, telephone numbers and other contact details, date of birth, vehicle registration details. We may also collect information about your use of our products and services, and any preferences you tell us about.

We do not collect sensitive information, such as your political or religious beliefs, ethnic background or sexual preference.

**Why we collect personal information**  
Generally, we collect and use personal information about members and customers to establish memberships and provide a range of products and services relating to mobility and related lifestyle needs, and to assist our internal administration and operations including accounting, risk management, record keeping, archiving, systems development and testing, and staff training.

**How we collect information**  
Generally, we collect personal information directly from you, such as when you apply for membership or request a product or service, in the course of providing you with that product or service (eg: roadside assistance), or when you have other dealings with us.  
We may collect and update that information over the phone, at roadside, over the Internet, in person (when you visit us at an NRMA office), when you write to us or if you participate in our marketing campaigns.  
We may also collect personal information through third parties such as:  
**·** NRMA Insurance Limited* which staff the NRMA offices, some call centres and manage some of the NRMA Country Service Centres;  
**·** affiliated interstate motorists' clubs to provide roadside assistance;  
**·** car dealers and manufacturers who provide membership packages in the sale of vehicles; or  
**·** our alliance and business partners with whom we have joint marketing arrangements.

**How we store information**  
We store personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records. In so doing, we have taken numerous steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Additionally we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it. Wherever practicable we will provide you the option of interacting with us anonymously.

**Other organisations and marketing to you**  
Because your privacy is important we will not sell, rent or trade your personal information without your consent.

However, to ensure a high level of service, we may disclose information about you to outside contractors to carry out specialised activities on our behalf, eg a mailing house. In particular, NRMA Insurance Limited and its related entities* provide us with a range of administrative, information technology, call centre and NRMA office services.

We may use your personal information and disclose it to companies in the NRMA Member Services Group, NRMA Insurance Limited and its related entities*, and to our other business partners, to give you information and offers about products and services offered by us or these companies.

If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us or any of these companies, please contact us on the contact details below to update your preferences.

We may also disclose personal information to NRMA Insurance Limited and its related entities* so that they may offer members discounts on their products from time to time.

We may also disclose personal information to other relevant parties in connection with your requests, such as to affiliated interstate motorists' clubs or the Australian Automobile Association.

To better protect your privacy, we impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on all third parties as to how they handle your personal information. Outside contractors are not allowed to use information about you for any purpose except to perform the services we have asked them to provide.

**Access to personal information**  
We will take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. If your personal details change, such as your address or phone number, please contact us on 132 132 to update your details so we can still provide you with our services.
