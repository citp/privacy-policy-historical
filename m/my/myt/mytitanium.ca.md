## IDENTIFYING PURPOSES

Money Mart will identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected. This information may be communicated orally, electronically or in writing. 

Money Mart collects, uses and discloses personal information for the following purposes: 

  * To provide financial services to customers;
  * To develop, manage and market products and services to meet the needs of customers;
  * To obtain credit information and credit reports from credit reporting agencies to assess credit history and credit worthiness and to confirm accuracy of information provided by individuals;
  * To confirm details of customer employment;
  * To contact customers for products and services that may be of interest;
  * To determine the eligibility of customers for different products and services that may be of interest;
  * To extract certain information for the purpose of generating statistics for our internal purposes;
  * To ensure a high standard of service to customers;
  * To record, track and respond to customer feedback and complaints;
  * To meet legal and regulatory requirements;
  * To confirm the identity of a customer; and
  * To collect debt that may become owed to Money Mart by a customer.

Money Mart will identify any new purpose(s) for which personal information is being collected, used or disclosed. Customers will be informed by either posting a notice on the Money Mart website ([www.moneymart.ca](http://www.moneymart.ca/)), written notification or direct communication. 

## CONSENT

Notice will be given and consent obtained when collecting, using and disclosing personal information, except when deemed inappropriate. 

Money Mart will make a reasonable effort to ensure that all customers have an understanding of the purpose(s) for which personal information is collected, used or disclosed. 

Money Mart will obtain consent to use and disclose personal information at the time the personal information is collected. Money Mart may also obtain consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but prior to the personal information being used or disclosed for a new purpose. 

Consent shall not be obtained through deception. An individual’s consent may be explicit or implied. Consent can be given either orally, electronically or in writing. Use of products and services offered by Money Mart constitutes implied consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for all identified purposes. 

Money Mart may collect, use or disclose personal information without the individual’s knowledge and consent in certain circumstances. For example:

  * When the collection, use, and disclosure is permitted or required by law;
  * When the collection, use, and disclosure is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely manner;
  * When seeking the consent of the individual may defeat the purpose of collecting the information;
  * When use of the information is for an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual;
  * When needed to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as otherwise required or authorized by law;
  * When the information is solely for Journalistic, Artistic, or Literary Intent; or
  * When the information is publicly available.

An individual may withdraw consent at any time subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Refusal or withdrawal of consent by a customer may prevent Money Mart from providing a product or service to that customer. Money Mart will not unreasonably withhold products or services from a customer who refuses or withdraws consent, but if the personal information is required to offer the product or service, Money Mart may decline to deal with the customer who will not consent to the use of such personal information. Money Mart may be contacted for more information regarding the method by which consent can be withdrawn. 

## LIMITING COLLECTION

The collection of personal information is limited to that which is related to the identified purposes.

Personal information will be collected by fair and lawful means. Most personal information will be collected directly from employees and customers.

Money Mart may collect personal information from sources such as credit bureaus, employers, personal references, or other third parties that represent they have the right to disclose such personal information. 

## LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION

Personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law.

Money Mart shares and stores customer personal and transaction information with affiliated companies of Money Mart located in the USA for the purposes listed in the Identifying Purposes section above and Money Mart keeps track of customer feedback and complaints utilizing a third party service provider whose servers are located in Europe.

  * A Money Mart agent that will evaluate the customer’s creditworthiness or to collect a potential debt;
  * A credit reporting agency to obtain credit information and credit reports to assess credit history and credit worthiness and to confirm accuracy of information;
  * The issuer and/or payer of negotiable items to confirm identity;
  * A third party – where individual consents to disclosure;
  * A third party – where disclosure is required by law;
  * A public authority or agent of a public authority where there is imminent danger to the life or property of an individual which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure; and
  * Conduct surveys in order to enhance our products and services to meet customer needs.

Where personal information is disclosed to a third party, Money Mart will ensure that appropriate security measures are utilized to protect the use and disclosure of personal information. 

Only Money Mart employees are authorized or granted access to personal information about customers when responsibilities reasonably require access. 

Money Mart will retain personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of identified purpose, or as required by law. 

## ACCURACY

## SAFEGUARDS
