			<h3>Deliver services, improve experience and personalisation</h3>

We may use your information to monitor and improve and protect our products, content, services and websites, both online and offline. We may also provide you with help and support where we believe it is required. For example, we may contact you where a checkout journey is not completed, if you have provided your information.</p>

			<p>The content on our websites and in our communications with you may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you may like. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you.  We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and app settings. See our <a href="#cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more information about how we use these.</p>

			<h3>Market research and analytics</h3>
			<p>We may use your information to conduct market research in order to improve the services we offer and to develop new products and services. </p>


			<h3>Deliver relevant advertising</h3>
			<p>We use targeted advertising to provide online advertisements that we believe are more relevant to your interests. We deliver online adverts based on the way you interact with us on our websites, mobile apps and tablet editions of our products and services. We may use information obtained through your participation in competitions, offers and events provided both by us and in cooperation with our commercial partners to deliver more relevant online adverts. We may also use your device’s location to deliver relevant online advertising. The information is aggregated and advertising based on your interests and profile is then displayed, when you visit websites or apps that use the same advertising networks. For more information please see our <a href="#cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

			<h3>Third party advertising </h3>
			<p>Advertising content may be adjusted depending on personal information. In some instances, this targeted advertising may be created by third parties and the information will be collected and held by these third parties outside of our control. We accept no responsibility for the content of advertising material, including any error, omission or inaccuracy contained within it. </p>


			<h3>Relevant communications</h3>
			<p>Unless you have told us otherwise, we may use your information to send you newsletters, bulletins and other information about your chosen services (for example, your Sun+ or Times+ subscription or one of our campaigns).</p>

			<h3>Direct marketing</h3>
			<p>This may include communications by post, telephone, email and messages to your mobile phone and through social media (such as Facebook and Twitter) about us and our business partners’ products and services, events and offers, including for a reasonable time after you may have ceased a subscription or service with us.</p>

			</ol>

			<h3>Sharing with third parties</h3>
			<p>We may pass your information to suppliers we use to provide services that involve using data on our behalf, for example for delivery services or market research agencies. We may also use suppliers to collect your information on our behalf but the use of your information will still be subject to this Policy.  </p>

			<p>If we provide to you a service that is dependent on age or residency and we have an obligation to verify this information (for example, The Sun Dream Team, regulated by the Gambling Commission) then we may pass your details to a third party to carry out the verification for us.</p>

			<p>We will only disclose your information to third party companies for their purposes, including marketing, when we have your permission to do so. For example, if we run a competition, the partner providing the prize may want to send entrants information about their products.</p>

			<h3>To provide co-branded services and features</h3>
			<p>We may offer co-branded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions, together with a third party and may share the information you provide with that third party.

			<h3>Acceptable use of services</h3>
			<p>If you post or send offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to any of our websites or apps, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our websites or apps, we may use the information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour.

			<h2 id="introduction2">Introduction</h2>
			<p>This Policy covers our use of cookies, IP addresses, and other technologies. It applies to all companies identified in the News UK <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
			<!-- What are Cookies? -->
			<h2 id="what-are-cookies">What are Cookies?</h2>
			<p>Cookies and other online tracking technologies are small bits of data or code that are used to identify your devices when you use and interact with our websites and other services. They are often used for remembering your preferences, to identify popular news stories, and remember you’re logged in, allowing you to comment on stories.</p>
			<!-- What Cookies do we use and how do we use them? -->
			<h2 id="cookies-used-for">What Cookies do we use and how do we use them?</h2>
			<h3>Essential cookies and similar technologies</h3>
			<p>These are vital for the running of our services on our websites and apps. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For example, Times+ uses cookies to help us identify which of our readers have a subscription in order to access content they are entitled to on the website. We use these cookies to tell if you’re logged in to your account, which allows extra functionality, such as making comments on stories.</p>

			<h3>Analytics cookies and similar technologies</h3>
			<p>These collect information about your use of our websites and apps, and enable us to improve the way it works.  For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on The Sun or The Times websites allowing us to provide the most popular news articles further up the page. They help us record how you interact with our websites, such as how you navigate around pages and from page to page; identifying improvements we can make to the customer journey. They also help identify any difficulties you have accessing our services, so we can fix any problems. Additionally these cookies allow us to see overall patterns of usage at an aggregated level.</p>

			<h3>Functional/preference cookies and similar technologies</h3>
			<p>These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like language, your username (so you can log in faster), text size, and location, so we can show you relevant content to where you are. They allow us to customize the services you have accessed. We also use these cookies to provide you with services such as video clips. </p>

			<h3>Tracking, advertising cookies and similar technologies</h3>
			<p>We use these types of technologies to provide advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. This can be done by delivering online adverts based your previous web browsing activity, known as “online behavioural advertising” (OBA). Cookies are placed on your browser which will remember the websites you have visited.  Advertising based on what you have been looking at is then displayed to you when you visit websites who use the same advertising networks. </p>

			<p>For example:  You may be doing online research in order to buy a bicycle, and read a number of articles about bikes on various websites. As you browse those sites a cookie from an advertising network would be placed in your browser. It would remember that you had visited several websites related to cycling. Then, when you visited another website in the same advertising network, the website could show you an advert related to cycling. </p>

			<p>We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with adverts based on your location, offers you click on, and other similar interactions with our websites and apps. </p>

			<p>To help us deliver relevant advertising using cookies, we use Google Double Click. You can find out more about Google Double <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/bg/doubleclick/"> Click here.</a></p>

			<h3>Web beacons</h3>
			<p>These are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been or that an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. Web beacons are also used to verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you and to inform advertisers how many customers have clicked on their adverts (this information is aggregated and does not identify you individually). </p>

			<h3>Flash cookies </h3>
			<p>We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as Flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser. </p>

			<h3>Tracking URLs</h3>
			<p>Tracking URLs are a special web link that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They are used to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read.</p>

			<h3>We also use cookies and similar technologies:</h3>
			<p>When you access and interact with our services cookies may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to our websites, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, other software or hardware information, and your geographic location.</p>

			<h3>If you access our services from a mobile device </h3>
			<p>We may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geo-location data, and other transactional information for that device.  We may also use the unique identifier to validate free trials, for example.</p>

			<h3>Usage of services</h3>
			<p>To collect, use and store information about your usage of our services, websites and apps, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen or interacted with. </p>

			<h3>To provide relevant content</h3>
			<p>The content on our websites and in our communications with you may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you like. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you.  We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and mobile app settings.</p>

			<!-- Third party advertisers -->
			<h2 id="third-party-cookies">Third party advertisers</h2>
			<p>We sell space on our websites to advertisers. The adverts they display on our websites will often contain cookies. Our advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertisements that they believe are relevant. They may use browsing data obtained to restrict the number of times you see particular adverts (frequency capping).  You may also see adverts from these advertisers on other websites you visit.</p>

			<p>Third parties that support our services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate service usage, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect information relevant to the provision of those services.
			</p>

			<p>We do not control third-party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. You should make sure you are aware of how third parties will use cookies by checking the third party’s cookie policy. </p>

			<p>To learn more about controlling cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below on <a href="#manage-cookies">managing cookies</a>.</p>

You may control these through using the tools on your device, such as turning off push notification and location services.</p>
