## 1\. Collection of Your Personal Data

We collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") about you that you provide to us or that we obtain while you are using the Site. Personal Data includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card number, e-mail address, age, date of birth, gender, username and password for our Site and any other information you may choose to provide or as may be required to fulfill the requested service. We also collect non-personally identifiable information, including your IP address, search preferences related to specific searches, location, and bids through your interactions with our Site. When we link non-personally identifiable information with Personal Data, we will treat it as Personal Data under this Privacy & Cookies Policy. Other key data collection points are as follows:

**Sign-in Features:** Our Site includes links to other web sites and online services whose privacy practices may differ from those of Priceline. For example, you can log in to our Site using single sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page to share with others within your network. If you submit Personal Data to or through any of those web sites or services, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any web site you visit or online services you use.

**Social Media:** The Site also includes Social Media Features and Widgets, such as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, and YouTube. These features may collect your IP address and/or which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

**Other Travelers:** If you purchase certain services, such as airline tickets, for other travelers, we will collect Personal Data of the other travelers that (i) is required to fulfill the requested service and (ii) you may otherwise provide to us. You must make sure that you have the right to provide such information. By providing any Personal Data of another traveler, you represent that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy & Cookies Policy. Personal Data of other travelers is collected only for the purpose of providing such Personal Data to the appropriate travel supplier, such as the airline on which travel will occur, to fulfill the requested service, or as otherwise may be required or permitted by applicable law.

## 2\. Protecting Your Personal Data

We employ reasonable and current technical, administrative and physical safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and to ensure correct use of Personal Data. To provide protection for credit card transactions while in transit, Priceline currently uses Secure Socket Layer encryption.

## 3\. Use of Your Personal Data 

We use Personal Data to provide you with the products and services from our Site, to build features that will make the services available on the Site easier to use, and to contact you about these services. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer support and timely notice of new services and special offers and more relevant content.

Certain jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we perform a transaction with you or respond to your requests); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for record keeping to substantiate our compliance with other laws; (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law); and (d) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we offer you relevant marketing if you have not previously objected). The provision of Personal Data as described in this Privacy & Cookies Policy is partly a contractual requirement (to provide information at your request and to engage in transactions with you) and partly a statutory requirement (e.g., for us to substantiate our compliance with other lawsand defend claims). In general, you do need to provide the Personal Data to engage in transactions with us, except in limited instances when we indicate that certain information is voluntary (e.g., in connection with surveys). Not providing Personal Data may prevent us from providing you with requested information and carrying out transactions. However, you can always exercise control over our use of data for marketing (click here for details) and you can control the use of cookies on our Site (click here for details). 

## 4\. Marketing

**You have control regarding our use of Personal Data for directing marketing**. Specifically, and where required by law with your prior consent, we may contact you to offer special savings or promotions, to provide marketing material or other offers, to request feedback on your experience using the Site or our services, or to assist us in improving the Site. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt-out from receiving them by using the **unsubscribe hyperlink** provided in any communication or contact us here.

**Priceline's Agents** : Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, Priceline hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail), analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Priceline requires all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements and to agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy.

In some instances we utilize service provider platforms to help us provide certain services to you such as our Career services provider, where this Policy governs the collection and use of your Personal Data even though you are on a third party website. In these instances, you will always know whose Privacy & Cookies Policy governs the collection and use of your Personal Data by clicking on the Privacy & Cookies Policy link provided.

**Future Business Transfers** : Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, Priceline may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that Priceline, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction. In such cases, the acquiring company would be required to honor the privacy promises in this Privacy & Cookies Policy or obtain your consent to any material changes to how your Personal Data will be handled.

**Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures** : Priceline reserves the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, protect us or others against fraudulent or inappropriate activities, or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of Priceline, our affiliated companies, our customers, or others. Please refer to the privacy statements of the companies with whom we share Personal Data in order to protect us or others against fraudulent or other inappropriate activities: www.forter.com/forter-privacy-policy/ and http://www.accertify.com/en/client-privacy/.
