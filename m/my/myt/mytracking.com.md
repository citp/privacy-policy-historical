**1\. How we collect information**

We collect information in three basic ways:  
We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a registered user of our service, and when you use certain aspects of our service (e.g., entering an email address on a form to send an email from your CybEye account).  
We collect information when you register to join CybEye by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to Facebook ) via our service. For example, our service allows you to create an account and login to the service using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook connect. If you are not currently registered as a user on the service and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join CybEye.  
When you browse or use our service, technological tools including "Log Data" and "Cookies" collect certain information, as explained in the following section.

**2\. What information we collect and how we use it**

Personal Information. When you register with us through the service to become a registered User of

CybEye, we will ask you for certain information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, free-form biography, location/hometown, website and email address. If you decide to create your User account by logging into a SNS via the service, you are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your user account on our service; the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS's privacy and data practices. For example, by using Facebook connect, you are allowing CybEye to access the personal information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the service via Facebook. We use your personal information (in some cases, in conjunction with your "Non-Identifying Information," see below) to provide the Service to you. For example:

Account registration: We create your user account for your use of the service based upon the personal information you provide. 

Communications: We use your personal information to contact you with CybEye newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "preferences" information in your account settings. (See "Your choices regarding information," below.)

Customer Service: We use your personal information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.

Emailing via a CybEye Account: As part of the service, CybEye users may communicate with other registered and non-registered users through use of their CybEye accounts. Where users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from CybEye to those email addresses on their behalf.

Non-Identifying Information: We also collect other information that you provide as part of registration, the operation, and personalization of your events on CybEye that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you (e.g., without limitation, age and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information"). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be personally identified or contacted. But the same pieces of information are considered non-identifying information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non- identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences)We may combine your personal information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other CybEye Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the service and to analyze and understand how our service is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

Log Data: When you visit the service, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our service, pages of our service that you visit, the time spent on

those pages, information you search for on our service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the service and the service's technical administration, to increase our service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our service to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the service again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the service meet the criteria required to process their requests.

Cookies: Like many online services, CybEye uses "cookies" on our service to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device's hard disk. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize "persistent" cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Service. Second, we utilize "session ID" cookies to enable certain features of the service, to better understand how you interact with the service and to monitor aggregate usage by CybEye users and web traffic routing on the Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the service and then close your browser.You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the service or all functionality of the service.

**3\. Sharing of your information**

CybEye Users: When you register through the service and submit personal information to create a profile or visual collection, other CybEye users will see your name. If you choose to provide additional personal information in your profile, CybEye users will see such additional personal information, including, but not limited to, your photo, location, website and biography. Providing additional Personal Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with CybEye users.

Facebook Connect. We allow users to link their Facebook accounts to our service. Users can then post recent activity on our service back to their Facebook accounts. You will be prompted to decide whether

or not your activity on the service will be shared and disclosed on your Facebook service. You can disable the foregoing feature at any time by logging into your profile and selecting the option to disable Facebook Connect.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. CybEye cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.

If you choose to visit another website or online service by clicking on a link, you will be directed to that third party's website or online service. The fact that we may link to a website or online service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected and maintained through the service. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons.

Phishing: Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to CybEye. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.

Breach Notification: We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Service in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

International Transfer: Your information may be transferred to/and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, CybEye transfers personal information to the United States and processes it there.
