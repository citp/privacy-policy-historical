# Privacy Statement :: Dynabook :: Laptops/Notebooks, Storage & Accessories

Dynabook ANZ Pty Limited and its related Dynabook group companies (‘Dynabook’) are committed to protecting your privacy.

Dynabook is bound by, and is committed to complying with the Australian Privacy Principles as provided within the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) (“the ‘Act”) and any other relevant laws, regulations, and/or codes that relate to your Personal Information. This policy outlines precisely how Dynabook treats Personal Information that it collects and/or receives. The definition of “personal information” is quite broad, and refers to information that is about you, in any form, and that could reasonably identify you. Examples of such information include, but are not limited to your name, contact details, address, email address(es), social media information, credit history information, payment card details, and bank account details. 

Dynabook considers the management of Personal Information to be of paramount consideration, and commits to treating Personal Information with the care and consideration it would expect that others would with respect to its own Personal Information. Options available to Dynabook with regard to management include, but are not limited to use of password-protected technology, use of encryption technology, as well as use of Confidentiality Agreements. At all times, Dynabook shall implement both external and internal practices and policies to ensure management of Personal Information occurs in an open and transparent manner. 

Dynabook may collect Personal Information from you, in the event you consent to the collection of Personal Information, and that collection of Personal Information is relevant to Dynabook’s functions or activities. Examples include, but are not limited to Dynabook collecting your Personal Information when you visit or use Dynabook web pages, use Dynabook related software, use Dynabook apps, request or send information through this website, purchase through this website, apply for a credit account with Dynabook, and/or when you send feedback to, or otherwise deal with Dynabook. Dynabook will only collect and hold your Personal Information if it is reasonably necessary for Dynabook’s functions and/or the service we can provide to you. When you request information through this site, we need to know the location that information is to be sent to, and we will use this location to send to you the information you request in the form that you require. We will not pass your details to anyone else outside Dynabook or to approved business partners without your permission.

When you send feedback we ask for relevant contact details to thank you for your contribution and if required, to request more information. If you provide feedback to us, you agree that information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Dynabook may use such information on an unrestricted basis.

When you apply for a credit account with Dynabook, we ask for Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, bank details, and any other Personal Information we believe may be relevant to the application. By completing and submitting a credit application to Dynabook, you are not acting in an anonymous manner.

When you purchase products online from Dynabook, we ask for Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and payment details (e.g credit card details), as well as other Personal Information we believe may be relevant to the purchase. By purchasing products online from Dynabook, you are not acting in an anonymous manner.

Dynabook may also automatically receive and record information from the use of our site or apps. Such information may include your server address, top level domain name (eg. .com, .gov, .au etc), the date and time of the visit, the pages accessed, documents downloaded, the previous site visited, as well as general information about browsing habits and behaviour. By gathering information about your preferences and attributes, we can tailor our service offerings to your needs, and ultimately, provide you with goods and services in accordance with your requirements.

Dynabook may disclose your personal information to organisations such as:
