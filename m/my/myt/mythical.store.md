**Date of Last Revision: August 21, 2017**

Mythical Entertainment, Inc. ("Mythical") and its affiliates, operate this website (the "Site") and the services related to or offered on the Site (hereinafter, the "Services"). Mythical's Services may include, without limitation, tools, applications, email services, bulletin and message boards, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, calendars, and downloadable mobile applications related to the Site or provided through the Site.

Mythical provides you this privacy policy (the "Policy") to help you understand the kinds of information Mythical may gather about you when you visit the Site or use any of Mythical’s Services, and how Mythical may collect, use and disclose the information.

The use of the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy means information that identifies a specific person such as a person’s full name, address, e-mail address. The phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy means non-personal information that cannot reasonably be used to identify individual persons ( _e.g._ , interests, demographics and anonymous usage data).

By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to Mythical’s collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.

Your Personal Information will be processed by Mythical in the United States.

In addition to this general Policy, each Service may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular Service. These supplemental disclosures are made adjacent to the particular Service at the time Mythical collects the information. These supplemental disclosures also govern the use of your information.

In general you can use the Site and/or Service without telling Mythical who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, if you do not provide Mythical with certain requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and features that may be contained on the Site and/or Service.

INFORMATION GATHERED BY Mythical

Mythical collects information about you in the following ways:

**Information you voluntarily provide** **Mythical**  

Mythical collects and maintains information that you voluntarily submit to Mythical during your use of the Site and Services. For example:

  * When you register for the Site, certain provided information to Mythical will be required such as your name and email address;
  * When you post comments and/or content on the Site and/or Service information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, likes, status, profile information and/or picture. This information is always public, which means it is available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
  * If you sign up to enter a contest or sweepstakes or receive a newsletter, if any, you may provide Mythical contact information (e.g., email or physical address);
  * If you access or log-in to the Site and/or Services through a social media or other service or connect the Site and/or Services to a social media or other service, the information Mythical collects may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with Mythical, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Site and/or Services through social media services or when you connect the Site and/or Service to social media services, you are authorizing Mythical to collect, store, and use such information and in accordance with this Policy;
  * If you purchase a product or service, you may provide Mythical your credit card information; and

**Information Mythical collects through your use of the Site**

As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, beacons, log files and other technologies, Mythical may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example Mythical may determine through an IP address that a particular computer or device is located in Los Angeles and Mythical may use this information to deliver advertisements promoting Los Angeles-based businesses. This information allows Mythical to deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements. 

Information Mythical may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties ("Third Parties") with the information Mythical has already collected from you via Mythical’s Site and/or Services. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including verifying other information about you and to enhance the content and advertising Mythical provides to you.

Mythical and Third Parties may customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you provide Mythical; (ii) data Mythical receives from third parties; or (iii) your visits on the Site or use of Services and other websites or services (commonly referred to as "Behavioral Advertising").

3\. COOKIES AND TARGETED ADVERTISING




**Tracking Technologies (e.g. Cookies)**

Mythical and/or Third Parties may use tacking technologies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site and Services. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, the video and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. For contests or sweepstakes, if any, Mythical may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions.  For polls, Mythical may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. Mythical does not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.

Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser's directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Site, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Site or Service may not work properly, and you may not be able to access the Site and/or Services.

Mythical may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Mythical, its partners or their respective service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Site or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements.

**Targeted Advertising**

Mythical works with third party companies ( _e.g._ , ad networks) that may use cookies for purposes including, without limitation, understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Site, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with Mythical’s vendor. You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Site by clicking <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.

Mythical adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click here at <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers>).

Advertisers or other third parties on the Site may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. Mythical does not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI OPT-OUT website (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>) and DAA CHOICE PAGE (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>) and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.
