				<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
				<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.

Once you become a User, we require you to provide various contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site (which vary, depending on what kind of User you are), and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.</p>

				<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">Our Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
				<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.   The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:</p>
				<p>Subscribers and Members, Etc. In the normal operation of the Site Subscriber timesheets (including information entered by "staff" members)  are disclosed to the applicable Members, and Member information is disclosed to the applicable Subscriber. In general, information you enter on the Site is available to the other persons – whether they are Members, Subscribers, staff members or others – to whom you give access to your account or to whom you give access to the information through the normal operation of the Site.</p>
				<p>Payment Information. We use credit card and other payment information (such as PayPal email addresses) you submit to us on the Site to process payments you make through the Site. We do not store credit card or other payment method information, Credit card information is sent in an encrypted fashion to credit card processors that adhere to industry standard PCI compliant procedures to encrypt, secure and store credit card information. Payment processors (like PayPal and Stripe) have the sole and complete responsibility for the storage of credit card and payment information.</p>
		<p>Anonymized Aggregated Data. We aggregate and anonymize attendance information including (but not limited to) industry type, number of members, average number of hours worked, hourly rates and methods of punching in and out, and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to Subscribers. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
				<p>Forum. If you post on our forum or blog your username and other information you include is displayed in your postings or comments, and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities in the public areas of the forum will be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published content.</p>
				<p>Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers. We may from time to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation of the Site, and may disclose personal information to them in the course of our use of their services. For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of the Site. This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information.</p>
				<p>Legal Requests; Emergencies. TimeStation may disclose your personal information (a) to any governmental authority as part of an investigation to determine our compliance with any applicable law, rule, or regulation (including privacy laws, rules, and regulations), (b) in response to a court order, subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful judicial or administrative proceeding, (c) as otherwise required under any applicable law, rule, or regulation, and (d) in good faith, to protect or defend the rights or property of TimeStation and other users.</p>

				<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">Your Use of Other Persons’ Information</h3>
				<p>In order to facilitate the services provided by the Site, the Site allows you in certain circumstances to give other Users limited access to the personal information of other persons.

By entering into our <a href="TermsOfService.asp">Terms of Service</a>, you agree that, with respect to the personal information of other persons that you collect, use and disclose on the Site, you have all necessary consents and rights to collect, use and disclose that information as described in this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you agree that the indemnity you give to us in the <a href="TermsOfService.asp">Terms of Service</a> applies to any non-compliance by you with the foregoing.</p>
				<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  TimeStation stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us at support@MyTimeStation.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

				<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">Security</h3>
				<p>TimeStation strives to protect your personal information. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information, such as credit card number and billing information, you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Once TimeStation receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. More information about security is available on the Site and in our <a href="TermsOfService.asp">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
                <h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">International Data Transfers.</h3>
                
				<p>We are a global business. Personal Data may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers. We may transfer Personal Data that we maintain about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the Personal Data was originally collected, including to the United States. Those countries may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data.			    </p>
				<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">Other Information Collectors</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through the Site, whether they are Subscribers or Members or otherwise, different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them.

We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>

				<ul>
				  <li>The right to request confirmation of whether TimeStation processes Personal Data relating to you, and if so, to request a copy of that Personal Data;</li>

				  <li>				    The right to request that we export to another company, where technically feasible, your Personal Data that we hold in order to provide Services to you. </li> </ul>
				  
                  Where the processing of your Personal Data is based on your previously given consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You may also have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data on grounds relating to your particular situation.
      
				<p><strong>d. Process for exercising data protection rights.</strong> In order to exercise your data protection rights, you may contact TimeStation as described in the Contact Us section below. We take each request seriously. We will comply with your request to the extent required by applicable law. We will not be able to respond to a request if we no longer hold your Personal Data. If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory response from us, you may consult with the data protection authority in your country.</p>
				<p>For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request, such as verifying that the email address from which you send the request matches your email address that we have on file.

				<p>If you are a Member of a TimeStation Organization, please direct your requests directly to the Organization. For example, if you are making, or have made, a purchase from a merchant using TimeStation as a payment processor, and you have a request that is related to the payment information that you provided as part of the purchase transaction, then you should address your request directly to the merchant.</p>
<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30">Additional Policy Information</h3>
				<p>Invitations: You have the opportunity to invite others to work with you through your TimeStation account. To do that, TimeStation asks you to import or to manually enter your contacts’ email addresses. As you direct, we then send them an invitation on your behalf or other notices reflecting changes you make to their status in your account.</p>
				<p>If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will leave the TimeStation site and go to the site you selected. If you elect to use a third-party product or service in conjunction with TimeStation, you yourself enter into a license agreement with the third party for use of their product or service and their use of your data. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as TimeStation. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a TimeStation site, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.</p>
				<p>We may post your  testimonial or review along with your name.  If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at support@MyTimeStation.com.</p>

				<h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30"><a name="AccountDeletion" id="AccountDeletion"></a>Account Deletion</h3>
<p>TimeStation is a complex business network that connects millions of users. TimeStation&nbsp; manages a business eco system that brings together employees, companies and customers. This network relies on the exchange and sharing of information that is important to others in your network. Tracked hours, attendance status, employees, departments are all vital to other people that work with you. These are the official history of work done and moneys paid.</p>
                <p>The complexity and connected nature of the system requires that this history exists in perpetuity to accommodate proper function and accounting for the other systems that you have connected to like payroll and accounting systems. TimeStation cannot guarantee the deletion of all your information.</p>
                <p>When a customer chooses to close an account we will remove your information from our marketing and billing systems. This will ensure that there are not further mailings or billings directed towards the canceled user.		</p>
                <p>As we continue to refine TimeStation we will establish a method for the complete removal of all user information from the system without breaking accepted accounting principles for other connected TimeStation accounts.&nbsp;This document will evolve as these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion. Users wishing to be notified when this development is complete can indicate their wishes via support@MyTimeStation.com.</p>
                
              <h3 class="marg-b-10 marg-t-30"><a name="GDRP" id="GDPR"></a>For EU Residents (GDPR)</h3>  
                
If you are a EU resident, and are an employee/member of an organization that uses TimeStation, under the GDPR (the new General Data Protection Regulation standardising EU data privacy and protection laws that comes into effect on May 25th, 2018), you are entitled to make a data request from that organization.<br>
<br>
Organizations that use TimeStation are classified as “data controllers” of their members’ data under the GDPR. If you have questions about the personal data that a TimeStation organization holds about you, ask that TimeStation organization to supply you with the information you need by visiting the organizations’s website or office, or calling the organization at their listed phone number.

<br>
<br>
Under the GDPR, EU-resident individuals are entitled to request the following from organizations who manage their personal data:

<br>
<br>
<li>Information about the data being held;</li>
<li>To have any inaccuracies in the data corrected;</li>
<li>To have information erased;</li>
<li>To object to direct marketing;</li>
<li>To restrict the processing of their information, including automated decision-making (i.e., a decision made solely by automated means without any human intervention) or profiling (i.e., automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual); and</li>
<li>Data portability (to have data provided in a portable form to the individual requesting it or to have data sent to a third party at an individual’s request).</li>

<br>
While TimeStation is a data-processor for members of organizations that use TimeStation, TimeStation is a data controller of all its organizations’ personal data. TimeStation sets out what organizations data it holds, how it protects organizations data, why it holds organization data and what it does with organization data in this privacy policy.
