4\. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?

The privacy and protection of your Personal Information is important to us. You acknowledge that email messages sent over the internet are not encrypted and are not secure.

5\. COOKIES

6\. COMPLAINTS OR QUERIES

MTW tries to meet the highest standards when collecting and using Personal Information. For this reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously. We encourage people to bring it to our attention if they think that our collection or use of information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate. We would also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures. 

This Statement does not provide exhaustive detail of all aspects of MTW’s collection and use of Personal Information. However, we are happy to provide any additional information or explanation needed. Any requests for this should be sent to the address below.

7\. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR

We will retain your personal data for different periods depending on the service you have chosen to use us for, which may be a longer period than that for which we need to hold your data to provide those services, i.e. where we are under regulatory or statutory duties to hold your data for a longer period.  Data will be held by us for the period necessary to meet the purposes for which we initially collected the information.

  * By default, we retain personal data for six years after you have last been active on the Site. This is to allow you to continue to use your MTW account for the duration of the average lifecycle of an MTW user. 
  * After that period has passed, or after you request us to delete your data (whichever is earlier) we will delete your personal data except where we have specific reason which means we need to keep it for longer.
  * Records that you have shared publicly or have shared with another user, for example reviews you leave, messages you send and bookings you make, may remain on the Site after your personal information has been deleted but will no longer have identifying information which links them to you associated with them.
  * We may retain records where necessary to fulfil our regulatory or statutory duties.



8\. ACCESS TO AND RECTIFICATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

MTW tries to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people access to their Personal Information. Individuals can find out if we hold any Personal Information by making a ‘subject access request’, normally free of charge, under the data protection legislation. If we do hold information about you we will let you have a copy of that information unless a legal exception applies, in which case we will inform you of this at the time. You also have the right to request that information we hold about you which may be incorrect, incomplete, or which has been changed since you first told us, is updated or removed.

To make a request to exercise either of these rights, please either put the request in writing addressing it to the address provided below or email us your request to [support@mytutor.co.uk](mailto:support@mytutor.co.uk) with the subject line ‘Subject Access Request’.

9\. MOVING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

In the event that we process your data by automated means where you have either provided us with consent for us to use your information or where we used the information to perform a contract with you, you have the right to request that we send to you or to another organisation, an electronic copy of the personal data we hold about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, for example when you are dealing with a different service provider. If you would like us to provide you, move, copy, or transfer your information in this manner, please let us know by email to [support@mytutor.co.uk](mailto:support@mytutor.co.uk).  We will respond to you within one month after assessing whether or not this is possible, taking into account the technical compatibility with the other organisation in question.

10\. DELETION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You can ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where you have withdrawn consent for us to process it (as explained below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

To request that we delete your personal data please send an email with the subject line ‘Personal data deletion’ to [support@mytutor.co.uk](mailto:support@mytutor.co.uk).

11\. HOW YOU CAN WITHDRAW CONSENT TO OUR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right at any time to withdraw any explicit consent you have given us to process your personal data. Please note if you withdraw your consent it will not affect the lawfulness of any processing of your personal data we have carried out before you withdrew your consent. Should you wish to do so you can change your consent preferences at any time. To withdraw your consent for us to send your Third-Party Promotions change your preferences on your account settings and/or by contacting us at [support@mytutor.co.uk](mailto:support@mytutor.co.uk).

12\. HOW YOU CAN RESTRICT OR OBJECT TO OUR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You can ask us to suspend the way in which we are using your information in certain scenarios, or object to our processing your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest ground (or those of a third party) and you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases where you object, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Please note that if you want us to restrict or stop processing your data this may impact on our ability to provide our services. Depending on the extent of your request we may be unable to continue providing you with our service.

Any queries or concerns about the way in which your data is being used can be sent to [support@mytutor.co.uk](mailto:support@mytutor.co.uk)

13\. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING AND PROFILING

To provide you with our services, it is necessary for us to conduct profiling and automated decision making on your data consisting of: 

  * Screening applications from prospective tutors to check that your qualifications match our criteria and you have the right to work in the UK
  * Screening user messages sent on the Site to ensure contact details are kept private
  * Compiling metrics for Tutors on behaviours, activity on the Site, and availability to determine which requests you receive
  * Monitoring log in activity to determine whether tutors’ profiles remain active on the Site
