Sciente International is committed to protecting the privacy of MyTechLogy.Com users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. To that end, we have always had a robust and effective data protection program in place which complies with existing law and abides by the data protection principles. We have also recognised and fulfilled our obligations in updating and expanding this program to meet the demands of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The following statement explains Sciente International's commitment to managing your Personal Information and sets out how and when Personal Information is collected, held, used or disclosed. 

This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on the MyTechLogy.Com web site "Website", and does not apply to any other information or web site including, but not limited to, affiliated companies. In this Privacy Policy, "affiliated companies" shall mean entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Sciente International.

We revised this Privacy Policy notice to comply with the GDPR, ensuring that all individuals whose Personal Information we process have been informed of why we need it, how it is used, what their rights are, who the information is disclosed to and what safeguarding measures are in place to protect their information.

However we cannot control the actions and practices of these coaches and cannot guarantee GDPR compliance on their behalf. 



### **Third Party Web Sites**

The Website and MyTechlogy mobile app contain links to third party web sites over which we have no control. We are not and cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other web sites linked from our Website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so that you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. 

### **Notification of Purpose**

The information we gather on the Website may be shared with any of the affiliated companies and coaches on a worldwide basis in order to deliver the products and services we offer to employers such as career analytics, career coaching services, and searches for job seekers or in order to undertake analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling of our registered users. 

We gather information about our Website users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. Some of this data is analysed using, e.g., Google Analytics, a service offered by Google Inc. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may, in the future, share this information with our affiliated companies, but only in the aggregate, without identifying you individually, so that they too may understand how MyTechLogy.Com visitors use our Website, and also to create a better overall experience for you. 

We do not disclose your Personal Information to non-affiliated third parties, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or as required in legal proceedings.

### **Disclosure of Personal Information**

We may disclose your resume to third party employers who have posted job opportunities that may be of interest to you on the Website when you use the Website to submit your resume for those jobs. When you submit your resume in response to a job posting, a copy of the resume is provided to the third party employer that posted the job opportunity. You are aware and understand that we do not, and are unable to, exercise control over the manner in which third party employers utilize your Personal Information. You are deemed to have consented to our disclosure of your resume to relevant third party employers by using the Website to submit your resume. 

In addition to the above, if you voluntarily provide Personal Information to us or to third parties by way of the Website, you understand and agree that you are deemed to have consented to our collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information as necessary to carry out the purposes for which you provided the information. For example, if you disclose Personal Information in the "Reviews/Blogs" section of the Website and encourage other users to contact you for further information regarding your review, you are deemed to have consented to the Website publishing your post, containing the voluntarily-provided Personal Information, in order to carry out your intended communication. By voluntarily posting Personal Information on the Website, you also understand and agree that you are deemed to consent to other users sharing your post with third parties, whether by using the "Share" functionality provided by the Website, or by using direct links to pages on the Website, or in any other manner. 

We may disclose information to relevant third parties if you have consented to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the opportunities, products or services of third parties at the time you register for a MyTechLogy.Com account, we will supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular third-party. 

We disclose information to companies and individuals that we may hire to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting web servers and data on Amazon Web Services, web traffic analytics and digital marketing services from Google Inc., and payment processing from Paypal Inc. We may, in the future, also use third party services for providing marketing assistance or customer service. These companies and individuals may have access to your Personal Information as may be necessary to perform their functions, and we will, in good faith, engage with those that we believe will protect this information in compliance with GDPR. However we cannot control the actions of these parties and cannot guarantee compliance on their behalf. 

We will disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. 

We may disclose and transfer information to a third party in the process of acquiring all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via e-mail or through a prominent notice posted on the Website.
