<li><strong>Log information</strong> – When you access Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV services via a browser,      application or other client our servers automatically record certain      information.

</ul>
<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.</p>
<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>You can use the Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV Dashboard to review and control the information stored in your Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV Account.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV uses the&nbsp;DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web.

<h3>Information sharing</h3>
<p>Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent. We      require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal      information.</li>
<li>We provide such information      to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or      persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.      We require that these parties agree to process such information based on      our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other      appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
<li>We have a good faith belief      that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is      reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal      process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms      of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c)      detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,      or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Hutch      Media, LLC dba Ego TV, its users or the public as required or permitted by      law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Information security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<p>When you use Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. Please review the service Help Centers for more information.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Hutch Media, LLC dba EgoTV adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program.</p>
<p>Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, it is Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Hutch Media, LLC dba Ego TV and an individual.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
