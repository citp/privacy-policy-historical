Identity theft is one of South Africa’s fastest growing crimes that results in significant damage to a credit report. There are a number of ways that you could fall victim to this crime, including “phishing” (seemingly genuine but forged e mails from a seemingly reputable company that ask you to provide them with personal information in a linked website) and “Garbage sifters” (where individuals sort through your rubbish looking for bank statements, invoices etc, that reveal your personal information.

The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to be alert and aware of suspicious activities and modus operandi used by potential fraudsters
