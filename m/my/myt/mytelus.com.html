<h1>your privacy is important to us</h1>

<p>Although our ability to provide service requires that we collect personal information about our customers, we take measures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of that information.</p>

<p>Our commitment to safeguarding your privacy is reflected in our TELUS Privacy Code, which governs the behavior of our employees with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of our customers' personal information. We updated our privacy code to reflect the federal privacy legislation that came into effect on January 1, 2001.</p>

<p>We have also developed a <a href="/legal/privacy/brochure.html">TELUS Privacy Commitment</a> to explain why we collect personal information and how we use and protect this information.  &nbsp;In January 2008, we updated our Privacy  Commitment to provide more detailed information about the purposes for which we  collect, use and disclose personal information.&nbsp;  A copy of our Commitment is provided to all of our  customers. &nbsp;You can also access it from  this Web site.&nbsp; The updates are as  follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Under the heading <strong>“why we collect personal information”</strong>, we’ve noted that telephone  calls to or from our service representatives may be monitored or recorded for  quality assurance purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish  an alternative to having your call recorded, please discuss this with your  service representative.</li><br><br>
    <li>Under the heading <strong>“when do we disclose personal information?”</strong>, we’ve added two  examples.&nbsp; First, we’ve stated that we  may disclose personal information to meet legal or regulatory requirements,  such as under a court order or to a government institution if required or  authorized by law.&nbsp; Second, we’ve noted  that should we sell a part of our business or merge or amalgamate part or all  of our business with another entity, we may need to disclose customer  information as part of the transaction.&nbsp;  This is normal business practice in any such transaction.&nbsp; Any such disclosure would be subject to  appropriate privacy and security safeguards.</li><br><br>
    <li>Under the heading <strong>“how we protect your personal information”</strong>, we’ve noted that some  personal information may be stored and processed in Canada or another country.&nbsp; In either case, the information is protected  with appropriate security safeguards but may be available to government  agencies under applicable laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; For  example, our wireless business unit may provide customers with access to music  services that are hosted outside Canada.&nbsp; If you subscribe to those services, your cell  phone number may be securely stored in the application provider’s servers  outside Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
