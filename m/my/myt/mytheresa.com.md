## 1 Basic Information on Data Handling

1.1 Extent of the personal data processing 

We fundamentally collect and use the personal data of our users only insofar as this is required for the provision of a functional website and of our contents and services as well as for the implementation of our business purpose. As a rule we collect and use the personal data of our users only after the user has given his/her consent. Exceptions apply in such cases where it was not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and where the processing of the data is permitted because of statutory requirements.

1.2 Purposes and legal basis for the processing of personal data 

We process personal data only to fulfil our contractual obligations or to preserve our overriding legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are the implementation of our business purpose.

Insofar as we obtain consent from the data subject for processing operations of personal data, Article 6, paragraph 1, sentence 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.

In the processing of personal data required to perform a contract of which the contractual party is the data subject, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.

Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal requirement that our company is subject to, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.

In the case that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make the processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party and the interests do not override the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject of the first-named interest, Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing. 

1.3 Categories of recipients and personal data, origin of the same; data transmission

We forward personal data to our business partners and service providers for the implementation of the business purpose. To implement our business purpose we use typical contact and address data of our customer and business partners. We typically receive the personal data direct from the data subject or with the consent of the data subject and also in exceptional cases from third parties.

Insofar as nothing to the contrary is stated in the following sections, no forwarding of your data to third parties takes place, unless we are legally obliged to do so, or the data transmission is required to perform the contractual relationship or you have previously given your explicit consent to the forwarding of your data. External service providers and partner companies, such as, for example, online payment providers or the shipping company tasked with the delivery, only receive your data insofar as it is necessary for the execution of your order. However, in these cases the extent of the transmitted data is restricted to the minimum required. Insofar as our service providers come into contact with your personal data, we assure that the regulations of the data protection laws are observed in the same manner. Please also observe the data protection notices of the individual providers. The individual service provider is responsible for the contents of third party services, whereby we verify as far as can be reasonably expected that the services observe statutory requirements.

1.4 Transmission to third countries

Essentially we do not forward personal data to recipients in third countries (i.e. countries outside of the EU). Should data be forwarded to recipients in third countries, we assure not only that we will obtain the permission required for the forwarding, but that the third country recipient also assures an adequate level of data protection (or derogations for specific situations pursuant to Art 49 paragraph  1 GDPR applies). 

In specific case we forward personal data to recipients in third countries (i.e. countries outside of the EU). 

  * United States of America



In these specific cases we give the following guarantees as described in Art. 44 GDPR: 

  * EU standard contractual clauses 
  * Privacy shield



1.5 Data security

We have taken extensive technical and organisational precautions to protect your data from accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised persons. Our security procedures are regularly checked and revised to take into account technological progress.

1.6 Data deletion and storage periods

The personal data of the data subject is deleted or blocked, as soon as the purpose for which it was stored no longer applies. Storage can also be effected if this was required by the European or national legislators in European Union regulations, laws or other stipulations that the person responsible is subject to. The data is also blocked or deleted if a statutory storage period prescribed by the cited standards expires, unless there is a need for continued data storage for the purposes of a conclusion or performance of a contract.

## 2 General Data Collection when visiting our Website

When visiting the website for purely informational purposes, i.e. when you do not register or transfer other information to us, we collect only the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. 

Within the framework of the balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph  1 senteince1 lit. f GDPR we have taken into account and weighed up our interest in provision and your interest in the processing of your personal data in compliance with data protection requirements. As the data below is necessary for the technical provision of our service in order to be able to offer you access to our website and also to ensure stability and security, in particular to offer protection against misuse, we have come to the conclusion that this data - in conjunction with an assurance of data security based on the state of technology - can be processed, whereby your interest in processing in compliance with data protection requirements is adequately taken into account.

**Description and extent of data collection   **

Whenever our internet site is visited, our system automatically records data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer. 

The following data is collected:

  1. Information about the browser type and version used 
  2. The operating system and the interface of the user 
  3. The internet server provider of the user 
  4. The IP address of the user 
  5. Access status/http status code 
  6. Date and time of the visit 
  7. Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time
  8. Content of the request (concrete internet page)
  9. The quantity of data transmitted
  10. Websites, from which the system of the user accessed our internet site  
  11. Websites that are visited by the system of the user via our website
  12. Regarding mobile end devices: Manufacturer and type designation of the Smartphone, tablet or other mobile end devices 
  13. Low-level tracer



The data is likewise stored in the logfiles of our system. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place.

**Legal basis for data processing  **

The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the logfiles is Art. 6, paragraph 1, sentence1 lit. f GDPR.

**Purpose of data processing**  

The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary so as to enable delivery of the website to the computer of the user. To do this the IP address of the user remains stored for the duration of the session. 

Storage in logfiles is required in order to assure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves to optimise the website and to assure the security of our IT systems. In particular our website and our other IT system help us to adapt to the browser, operating system and end devices used. 

An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this connection.  

These purposes are also our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. f GDPR.

**Duration of the storage**  

The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. If the data is recorded in order to provide the website, this is the case when the session in question has ended. 

In the case of storage of data in logfiles, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage above and beyond this period is possible. In this case the IP addresses of the user are deleted or distorted so that it is no longer possible to recognise the calling client.

**Right to object and removal  **

The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in logfiles is absolutely essential for the operation of the internet site. As a consequence the user has no possibility to object to this. 

## 3 Registration

On our internet site we offer users the possibility to register by entering their personal data. The data is entered in the input mask and is transferred to us and stored. The data is not forwarded to third parties. The following data is collected as part of the registration process:

  * Salutation
  * Academic title (optional)
  * First name
  * Last name
  * Email
  * Password
  * Address
  * Telephone number
  * Company (optional)
  * Country
  * Packing station (if available)
  * CPF – Natural Person Register (only Brazil)



At the time of registration the following data is also stored:

  1. The IP address of the user
  2. Date and time of the registration
  3. Customer number
  4. Entity-ID
  5. Email hash



The user is asked as part of the registration process to consent to the processing of this data. After registration has been completed you receive a personal access protected by password and can view and manage the registration data. Registration is effected on a voluntary basis, but may be a precondition for using our services.

In this connection your data is forwarded to our email service provider Emarsys so that we can send you an email confirming your registration.

**Legal basis for the data processing**

Assuming the user gives his or her consent, the legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. a GDPR.

If registration serves to perform a contract, of which the contractual partner is the user or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract, the legal basis for the processing of the data is also Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. b GDPR.

**Purpose of data processing**

User registration is necessary for the provision of certain contents and services, in particular the extended use of our web shop on our website. User registration also serves for the performance of a contract with the user or to take steps prior to entering into a contract. Registration refers in particular to the use of our web shop.

Sales contracts are typically concluded via the web shop for the following product groups:

  * Clothing
  * Shoes
  * Bags
  * Accessories (including jewellery)
  * Children's clothing
  * Furnishings
  * Gift vouchers



**Duration of the storage**

The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.

This is the case for the data collected during the registration process if the registration on our internet site is cancelled or modified.

Insofar as the data collected during the registration process is required to perform a contract or to take steps prior to entering into a contract, this is only the case when the data is no longer required to perform the contract. Even after conclusion of the contract it may still be necessary to store personal data in order to fulfil contractual or statutory obligations.

Personal data is stored as a measure to prevent fraud.

The deletion deadline for the purposes of fraud prevention is 6 months, for actual attempts of fraud 6 months.

**Right to object and removal**

As a user you can cancel your registration at any time. You can have the data stored about you altered at any time.

You can send an email to [privacy@mytheresa.com](mailto:info@mytheresa.com) requesting the deletion or modification of your data.

If the data is required for the performance of a contract or to take steps prior to entering into a contract, a premature deletion of the data is only possible insofar as no contractual or statutory obligations contradict this.

## 4 Contact

Our internet site has a contact form which can be used to contact us by electronic means. If the user takes advantage of this possibility, the data entered in the input mask is transmitted to us and stored. This data is:

There follows a list of the data in the input mask:

  1. First and last name
  2. Email address
  3. Subject
  4. Message



No data is stored when the message is sent. Alternatively, contact can be established via the email address provided. In this case the personal data of the user transmitted via the email is stored. In this connection the data is not forwarded to third parties. The data is solely used for the processing of the conversation.

**Legal basis for the data processing**

If the user has given his or her consent, the legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. a GDPR. paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. a GDPR.

Legal basis for the processing of the data that is transmitted as part of sending an email is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. a GDPR. If the intention of the email contact is the conclusion of a contract, the legal basis for the processing is also Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit. a GDPR.

**Purpose of data processing**

The processing of personal data from the input mask is used solely for the process of establishing the contact. In the case of contact by email there is also the necessary and legitimate interest in processing the data.

The personal data otherwise processed during the sending process is used to prevent misuse of the contact form and to assure the security of our IT systems.

**Duration of the storage**

The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. For the personal data from the input mask of the contract form and the personal data sent by email, this is the case when the conversation with the user has ended. The conversation is deemed to have ended when the circumstances suggest that the subject matter in question has been conclusively clarified.

The personal data additionally collected during the sending process is deleted at the latest seven days afterwards.

**Right to object and removal**

The user can revoke his or her consent to the processing of personal data at any time. If the user establishes contact with us via email, he or she can object to the storage of his or her personal data at any time. The conversation cannot be continued in such a case.

You can inform us of your revocation of consent as well as your objection to storage of your personal data by sending an email to **[privacy@mytheresa.com](mailto:info@mytheresa.com)**.

In this case all personal data stored during the establishment of the contact is deleted.

## 5 Newsletter

We use the so-called double opt-in procedure and the confirmed opt-in procedure for registration to our newsletter. The double opt-in procedure means that we send you a confirmation email to the email address you provide, in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm within a period of 72 hours, the data will be deleted automatically. If you confirm your wish to receive the newsletter, we will store your email address until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. The storage serves the sole purpose of being able to send you the newsletter. In addition, we also store your IP addresses when you register and confirm as well as the times, in order to prevent misuse of your personal information.

Email Service Provider: The newsletter will be sent by Emarsys interactive services GmbH, Stralauer Allee 6, 10245 Berlin, Germany, hereinafter referred to as the "Email Service Provider". You can view the privacy policy of the email service provider here: <https://www.emarsys.com/en/privacy-policy/>

The email address is the only required information for sending the newsletter. The provision of additional, specially marked information is voluntary, and it will be used solely for the purpose of personalising the newsletter. This data will also be completely deleted if you revoke consent. In addition, we store the IP addresses you use for registration and confirmation, as well as the times these events take place. The purpose of this procedure is to have evidence of your registration and, if necessary, to clarify any possible misuse of your personal data. After your confirmation, we save your registration data for the purpose of sending you the newsletter. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(1)(a) GDPR.

If we have received your email address in connection with your order and you have not objected to this, we reserve the right to send you regular offers by email for products similar to those you have already purchased from our product range.

You can object to the use of your email address and the processing and use of data to create user profiles at any time without giving reasons, simply by sending a message to [privacy@mytheresa.com](mailto:privacy@mytheresa.com) or via the unsubscribe link in the email newsletter, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs defined in, for example, your existing Internet service contract.

We would like to point out that we evaluate your user behaviour when sending the newsletter. For this evaluation, the emails we send contain so-called web beacons, also known as tracking pixels. These are one-pixel image files that link to our website, enabling us to evaluate your user behaviour. This is done by collecting web beacons, which are assigned to your email address and linked to your own ID. Links contained in the newsletter also contain these beacons.

The email service provider also stores cookies on your computer through your web browser. The cookies and the identification numbers stored in them will not be associated with your name, address, email address or other personally identifiable information unless you have expressly permitted us to send you information specifically tailored to your interests. The email service provider uses these cookies to recognize your browser, so that we can track your movements on our website as well as recording and measuring the success of certain marketing actions. We use this information to improve our website and email newsletters, in particular by adapting our information and offers to the individual interests and needs of users.

The storage of cookies by the email service provider is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a justified interest in the anonymous analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both their website and their advertising.

With the data obtained in this way, we create a pseudonymous user profile in order to be able to provide you with a newsletter tailored to your interests. The following data will be collected:

  * Have you opened the newsletter? And what did you click on in it?
  * When and how long did you visit our website? What products and categories did you look at?
  * When and what did you purchase? What category, and in what amount? And: Did you cancel the order?



We associate this data with your user account, if you have logged in.

The information we collect is stored on a server located within the European Union.

You can opt out of the cookie-based collection and analysis of online data described above by clicking the opt-out button below. If you exercise this option, an anonymous "opt-out" cookie will be stored in your web browser, informing the Emarsys web servers of your opting out and preventing the collection of data. The opt-out cookie will remain in effect in the browser you are using until you delete it using that browser. However, if you delete the cookie or use a different browser or computer, the email service provider will no longer be able to recognise that you have declared your objection. Alternatively, you can configure your browser so that it does not accept cookies.

If you have registered in our webshop and placed products on your wish list, you will receive emails informing you about discounts, availability and the last available unit of the products on the wish list. You can unsubscribe from these notifications by unchecking the box at the end of the wish list.

## 6 Your Order in our Online shop

If you would like to place an order in our web shop it is necessary for the purposes of concluding the contract that you provide personal data which we require to process the order. Mandatory details required for the processing of contracts are specifically marked as such, other details are voluntary. We use the data given by you to process you order. In addition, we can forward your payment details to the payment service provider selected by you. Additionally, we forward your address details to the shipping logistics service provider selected to carry out shipping.

The legal basis for this is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence1 lit b. GDPR.

You can also create a user account on a voluntary basis, which we can then use to store your data for additional purchases at a later date. This registration is based on Point 3 of this declaration.

We can also process the data given by you in order to notify you about additional products in our range that you may find of interest or have emails about technical information sent to you.

Commercial and fiscal stipulations require us to store your address, payment and order details for the period of ten years. Nevertheless, we restrict processing after two years; this means your data is only used to observe the statutory requirement.

You can object to the use of your data for advertising and data analysis purposes at any time. Please send your objection to [privacy@mytheresa.com](mailto:privacy@mytheresa.com).

To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data, in particular financial data, the order process is encrypted by hybrid encryption protocol for the secure data transmission "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL).

12.11.4 Pinterest

On our site we use Pinterest (Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street San Francisco, CA 94103-490, USA). Due to our legitimate interests in the analysis and optimisation of our online services and the requirements-appropriate use of our Pinterest campaigns, the so-called "Pinterest Tag" (custom code snippet) is integrated into our website by Pinterest on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. If a Pinterest user looks at or clicks on the advertisement, further actions and target groups that have shown interest will be tracked. Using this allows us to ensure that Pinterest advertisements are only displayed to Pinterest users who have already shown an interest in our offering and if they correspond to the potential interest of the user. This data helps us measure the conversion of each campaign. It is used for statistical and market research-related purposes and help optimise the campaigns.

All collected data is anonymous for us and does not provide any conclusions about the identity of the respective user. Data is collected on the device information (e.g. type, brand), the operating system used, the IP address of the device used, the time of the retrieval, the type and content of the campaign, the reaction to the respective campaign (e.g. conclusion of purchase, newsletter registration) and device IDs consisting of individual characteristics of the terminal device. This allows us to recognise your device on our website.

If you do not want Pinterest to use the information collected through our web site to assign you to your profile on Pinterest, then before visiting our website you must log out of Pinterest.

Further information on the purpose, scope and further processing and use of the data by Pinterest as well as your rights and possibilities to protect your privacy in this regard can be found in the Pinterest data protection information: <https://about.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy>.

## 13 AFFILIATE NETWORKS

In addition, we collaborate with affiliate networks, such as Commission Junction/Zanox/etc.

An affiliate network is a service provider from the online advertising sector and an agent between advertisers (mytheresa.com) and publishers (website operators). Publishers can enter into a partnership via the affiliate network with mytheresa.com and thus take part in special promotions. Therefore, the publisher integrates a mytheresa advertisement/promotion code/hyperlink in the content on its website and thus leads the customer to our online shop through, for example, an editorial text.   
As soon as the user buys on mytheresa.com, the publisher receives an appropriate commission. Only the information on the sale, such as order ID, product ID and the prices of the products sold, is transferred to the network. No personal data are collected or transferred.

## 17 USE OF RISKIFIED

For the administration of payments or to fight fraud in credit card payments, we share rare data with Riskified Ltd (34 W 27th St, Suite 502, New York, USA), which are processed only for this purpose.

Riskified uses the transferred data only in suspicious cases to compare these with their databank and to then provide an estimate of the risk of fraud.

The following data are transferred:

  * Transaction data (delivery and invoicing address, name, telephone number)
  * Email address
  * Shipping country
  * IP address



The legal basis for the use of the data for fighting fraud is Art. 6, Para.1, P. 1, lit. f, GDPR.

Personal data are transferred to the USA. There are guarantees pursuant to Art. 44 et seq. GDPR through EU standard contract clauses. If you wish to view the standard contract clauses, please send us an email at [privacy@mytheresa.com](mailto:privacy@mytheresa.com).

## 18 Use of Whitepages

To combat credit card fraud, we occasionally share information with Whitepages (Whitepages, Inc., 1301 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1600, Seattle, WA 98101, USA) that is processed solely for this purpose.

Whitepages uses the provided data only in suspicious cases, to check it against their database and then to make an assessment of the risk of fraud.

The following data will be transmitted:

First and last name  
Complete address (shipping and billing addresses, if different)  
Telephone number  
IP address  
Email address

The legal basis for processing of data is Article 6 (1) sentence 1f of the GDPR. As part of the weighing of interests pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, we have considered and weighed our interest in the service of Whitepages and your interest in processing your personal data in compliance with data protection regulations, and have come to the conclusion that our legitimate interests prevail, namely the intention to make a profit, the reduction of our default rate and protection against credit risks.

Personal data will be transmitted to the United States. Guarantees pursuant to Articles 44 et seq. GDPR are provided by standard EU contractual clauses. If you would like to view these standard contractual clauses, please send us an email at [privacy@mytheresa.com.](mailto:privacy@mytheresa.com). Whitepages does not provide precise information about the duration of data storage. You can find the [Whitepages Pro privacy policy here](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__pro.whitepages.com_privacy_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=zBVcddMcOHXdl-UbJUq6zg_lbHHND5j-m4VoFzV1Ftw&m=g4hIZpkirnWECNLRDqAvBcDHi1EXj9KVdcizYelOHr4&s=9ABLxXi_IaDEHXka-fVtNs0OY5BIMWMEKBLW3eI2yd8&e=).

## 19 DISCLOSING DATA

There will be no transfer of your personal data to a third party apart from for the specified purposes.

  * We disclose your personal data to a third party only if:
  * you have given your explicit consent to do so,
  * the disclosure is required for asserting, exercising or defending legal rights and there are no grounds for assuming that you have an overriding legitimate interest in the non-disclosure of your data,
  * that there is a statutory obligation for the disclosure, and
  * this is legally permissible and required for implementing the contractual relationships with you.



Fundamentally, the high European level of data protection does not apply to data transfer outside the European Union. For a transfer, it can be that there is currently no adequacy decision by the EU Commission in the sense of Art. 45, Para. 1, 3 GDPR. This means that the EU Commission has not yet positively determined that the country-specific level of data protection corresponds to the level of data protection of the European Union based on GDPR, which is why we have created the abovementioned suitable guarantees. 

Possible risks, which cannot be completely excluded in connection with the data transfer are in particular:

  * your personal data could possibly be dealt with beyond the actual purpose.
  * Moreover, there is a possibility that you cannot sustainably assert and implement any of your legal data protection rights, such as, for example, your right to information, correction, deletion or data portability. 
  * There may also be a higher probability that there could be incorrect data processing and the personal data do not quantitively and qualitatively meet or not fully meet the requirements of GDPR.
