Furthermore, TransUnion takes all reasonable steps to ensure that all records of Consumer Information are submitted, processed and maintained in accordance with the standards required in terms of the NCA, including by placing stringent requirements in this regards on its "data suppliers" (including credit providers and other recognized data sources in terms of the NCA).</p>

    <b>Obtaining Consent</b>
    <p>In the majority of instances, TransUnion is not capable of being provided with direct consent by consumers. Such consent is directly provided by consumers to TransUnion's data suppliers. TransUnion however takes all reasonable measures to ensure that all data suppliers are contractually bound to   ensure that all legally required consents are obtained prior to accessing any Consumer Credit Information contained in our reports. </p>

    <b>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
    <p>Non-personal information is data that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect this information in a number of ways. Should we elect to combine non-personal information with personal information; the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

    <b>HOW AND WHY WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b>
    <p>The following are reasons why we would collect your personal and non-personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to identify you; </li>

        <li>for purposes of any TransUnion promotional competitions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that we may also use (but will not disclose) your personal information to promote and market additional products, services and special offers from us and/or our affiliates that may be of interest to you.  You may opt-out from receiving such communications, at any time. If you wish to opt-out, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@transunion.co.za">webmaster@transunion.co.za</a></p>

    <b>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</b>
    <p>Confidentiality of your personal information is important to us.  We will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.  Unless we have your permission, we will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you when you provide us with your data.</p>
    <p>We remind you that you are solely responsible for ensuring the security and secrecy of your user name and password that may be provided to you for any TransUnion account. TransUnion cannot bear any responsibility for your failure to ensure this. You therefore indemnify TransUnion for any losses that may result from your failure to ensure the security and secrecy of your user name and password. </p>
    <p>We may only access and/or disclose your personal information without your consent in exceptional circumstances.  These include circumstances where we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) comply with requests for information from police or government authorities, (c) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); (d) protect the public interest; (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees or members of the public; (e) where applicable, with your implied consent ; and (f) to the extent permitted or required in terms of the NCA and other relevant national legislation.</p>

    <b>ENSURING THAT YOUR INFORMATION REMAINS ACCURATE</b>
    <p>We aim to ensure that your personal information is accurately recorded. To be able to achieve this we adhere to processes that help ensure and maintain data accuracy.  We provide individuals with reasonable access to review and correct their personal information, as detailed in our website.</p>
    <p>When gathering your personal information TransUnion works with our data suppliers to increase their awareness of the importance of providing only personal information that is accurate, complete, and up to date. TransUnion however, cannot alter the information reported by such data suppliers, unless the information is determined to be wrong, incomplete or inaccurate.

    <b>A WORD OF CAUTION</b>
    <p>Identity theft is one of South Africa's fastest growing crimes and one that can result in significant damage to an individual's credit report. There are a number of ways that you could fall victim to this crime, including "phishing" (seemingly genuine but forged e-mails from a seemingly reputable company that ask you to provide them with personal information in a linked website) and "garbage sifters" (individuals who sort through your rubbish looking for bank statements, invoices, etc. that reveal your personal information. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to be alert and aware of suspicious activities and modus operandi used by potential fraudsters.</p>

    <b>CONTACTING TRANSUNION</b>
    <p>Consumers' are welcome to contact TransUnion should they require more information or have any questions. We can be contacted using the details indicated in this Privacy Policy above.</p>
