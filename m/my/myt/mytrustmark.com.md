### **WHAT DOES TRUSTMARK DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

## Why?

| 

Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.  
  
## What?

| 

The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:

  * Social Security number and income
  * account balances and payment history
  * credit history and credit scores



When you are no longer our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.  
  
  
## How?

All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers’ personal information; the reasons Trustmark chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.

### **What we do**  
  
**How does Trustmark protect my personal information?**

| 

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. 

We restrict access to your personal and account information to those associates with proper authorization to access such information.   
  
**How does Trustmark collect my personal information?**

| 

We collect your personal information, for example, when you 

  * open an account or apply for a loan 
  * make deposits or withdrawals from your account 
  * use your credit or debit card
  * apply for insurance



We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus.  
  
**Why can’t I limit all sharing?**

| 

Federal law gives you the right to limit only 

  * sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness 
  * affiliates from using your information to market to you 
  * sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you 



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.   
  
**What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?**

| 

Your choice will apply to everyone on your account.
