**Privacy Policy**

**Our Policy Behind Our Privacy Policy**  
My Total Money Makeover refuses to make you read through pages and pages of boring text about a policy that does nothing but trick you into NOT reading it. We have chosen to make our privacy policy clear and concise enough that you will read it and feel comfortable on our site, knowing that we have every intention to protect your privacy.

**Our Privacy Policy**  
Respecting the privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. We realize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created a Privacy Policy to show you the steps we have taken to secure that trust. Please take a few moments to read this privacy policy carefully.

**Collected Information**  
There are certain instances where you may be asked to provide your personal information on our site. The information that we collect is for administrative use only. We use it to better understand and serve your needs, as well as provide you with services that may be uniquely valuable to you.

**Use of Information  
** We do not use the information you provide us for any purpose unless otherwise consented by you personally. Information submitted will not be available to anyone other than our staff or business partners whose services you have requested. This information is specifically used by our partners to provide you with the services you have requested and is not redistributed in any way. 

We make every effort to keep our subscribers informed of special events, news, and offers that are happening or available. Periodically, announcements are released via email. 

Note: Your information will be subjected to submission if ordered by a court of law.

**Security  
** We are determined to keep your information private. We have even added measures to protect your personal information in transitions. For example, when you supply us with your debit card or checking account information to make a purchase, your information is encrypted to insure a safe and secure transaction. Your payment information is temporarily stored on a secure server before processing. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access through (1) the use of vendors that specialize in providing secure online payment solutions and by (2) not allowing your account/payment information to be accessed via the Internet.
