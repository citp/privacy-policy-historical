We use this information to measure the performance of our application and to provide analytics information and enhance the effectiveness of our Services. We use page tags (also known as web beacons) in the emails we send to our Users. When you receive and engage with marketing messages we send to you, web beacons track certain behavior such as whether the email sent through the Services was delivered and opened. Links within these emails are tracked to show individual recipient’s clicks. For more information, read about our cookies and other tracking technologies in more detail in our Cookie Notice [here](https://myemma.com/legal/cookie-notice).
  5. Children.
    1. Our Services are not intended for and may not be used by minors. "Minors" are individuals under the age of 13 (of under a higher age if permitted by the laws of their residence). We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Minors or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact customer support.
    2. Customers and their Users are responsible for ensuring that their emails and data collection practices comply fully with applicable children's data privacy protection legislation, such as the United States' Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and applicable European Union Member State laws which implement Article 8 of the GDPR with respect to children's’ consent in relation to information society services, including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of Personal Information. We rely upon our Customers to disclose whether or not their use is subject to any law, in part or full, which specifically protects the rights of children.
  6. Legal Basis For Processing Personal Information (EEA Residents Only)
    1. If you are a resident in the EEA, then our legal basis for collecting and using Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, where we are processing your Personal Information for our own purposes we normally rely on our legitimate interest to collect Personal Information from you, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your Personal Information, they include the interests described in the sections above headed "Why We Process Your Information".
    2. In some cases, we may rely on your consent or have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your Personal Information, we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.
    3. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.
  7. Data Retention.
    1. We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a Service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
    2. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymise Personal Information. If this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    3. We will retain information we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide Services to our Customers (unless deletion is requested at an earlier time by the Customer) and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We reserve the right to delete Customer’s, its Users’, and its Contacts’ information at the termination of Customer’s contract with us (unless such deletion is prohibited by applicable laws).



## 3\. EMMA USERS’ CONTACTS (GENERALLY EMAIL RECIPIENTS)

This section applies to Personal Information we collect and process about our User's Contacts through the Services as a data controller. In this Section "you" or "your" refers to a Contact.

Note: While Emma hosts the application used to build and send marketing emails and online forms, our Services are intended for use by our Customers and their Users control the content uploaded to the Services, the content of emails sent, forms built, and information provided at the point of collection of Contacts’ Personal Information-- and for the most part-- what is done with the information received. As a result, for much of the Personal Information we collect and process about our Customers’ Contacts, we act as a processor on behalf of our Customers (the controller). Emma is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our Customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Notice. We require our Customers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide Contacts with notice of the collection of data as outlined in this Notice. To understand how Customers and their Users will use your Personal Information, you will need to directly contact the User who sent you the email or whose online form you filled out.

  1. Information We Process   

    1. Information We Receive About Contacts from Users. A User may provide Personal Information about you to us through the Services in connection with their use of the Services– for example, when a User imports and/or collects email addresses and other Personal Information about their Contacts.
    2. Information Collected Automatically. When you interact with the Services (for example receive, open an email sent through the Services), we automatically collect certain information about your device and interaction with the Services. We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect some of this information. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed in more detail below and [here](https://myemma.com/legal/cookie-notice). The information we automatically collect through the Services may include:
      1. Device Information. We collect information from your device and applications you use to view emails sent via our Services, such as your IP address, device attributes (for example: hardware model, operating system, web browser version, as well as unique device identifiers and characteristics), connection information (for example, name of your mobile operator or Internet Service Provider, browser type, language and time zone, and mobile phone number); and device locations (for example, internet protocol (IP) addresses and Wi-Fi information).
      2. Email Engagement Data. Emails sent by or on behalf of our Users through the Services include page tags (also known as web beacons) that allow the sender to collect information about who opened those emails. Additionally, your engagement with any links in emails sent using the Services (for example, when you click a link) is reported to the User. This tracking of email engagement is active by default for all email recipients. Our Users are able to turn off email tracking according to their determination of what is appropriate based on their relationship with their Contacts; or whenever a user withdraws consent for tracking; or based on the User’s determination of their own legal obligations regarding the use of this technology. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed in more detail in our [Cookie Notice](https://myemma.com/legal/cookie-notice).
  2. Why We Process Your Information.   
We process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests, which include:
    1. In Connection With Support Queries. To respond to an enquiry which you may submit to us. For example, our customer support team may use your email address to communicate with you if you have contacted us about an email you received, but we will not send marketing to you unless you have otherwise opted-in to marketing.
    2. To Improve Our Product & Ensure Functionality.
      1. To ensure the full functionality of the Service. We collect information using cookies about your interaction with an email sent to you through the Services. These cookies are used to ensure that the full functionality of our Services is operational; to ensure that the Service experience works well across all possible devices; and to fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.
      2. To track behaviour at the aggregate/anonymous level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our Services (for example, by inferring geographic location to produce aggregated data around Contact location trends as they relate to open rates). This data will be aggregated and anonymized so we can examine patterns in terms of Contacts’ preferences as they relate to email engagement. We collect and use all this data for our legitimate interests like providing our Customers with metrics around probability of engagement related to email sending times, locations, content and also to help our Customers understand industry trends in marketing.
      3. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed in more detail below and in our [Cookie Notice](https://myemma.com/legal/cookie-notice).
    3. To Prevent Abuse/Illegal Activities. To screen for and prevent undesirable, abusive, and/or illegal activity. We use your IP address and an Emma auto-generated Contact ID for abuse monitoring purposes (so we can identify a User who abused the Services by sending spam email or sent an email in any other manner contrary to our usage policies and/or to facilitate a User in complying with their own legal obligations). We also have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud.
    4. For Legal Records. To enforce our agreements where applicable (for example we keep a record of the number of emails sent to individual Contacts for to bill for Services used by our Customers). To respond to legal requests or prevent fraud, we may need to disclose any information or data we hold about you. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.
  3. How We Share Your Information.   
In the following limited situations, we may disclose Contact information to someone other than the Customer or their User:
    1. to our contractors, service providers and other third parties who provide data processing services to us and with whom the sharing of your Personal Information is necessary to undertake the work e.g. to process billing, to analyze data, host data, deliver content and to provide customer support and other business related functions.
    2. to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to a governmental or regulatory request.
    3. to Affiliates of our corporate group for customer support, technical operations, and account management purposes.

  4. Cookies And Tracking Technologies.   
We (including our partners and vendors) use various technologies to collect and store information when you interact with a User's email campaign or other content delivered through the Services, and this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as pixels and web beacons.

When you receive and engage with a User's campaign, web beacons track certain behavior such as whether the email sent through the Services was delivered and opened and whether links within the email were clicked. They also allow us to collect information such as your IP address, browser, email client type and other similar details.
