<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1><br>

<a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.myevent.com&amp;sealid=101" class="normal" title="Click to visit eTrust.org" rel="external" target="_blank"><img src="/images/common/clickseal.gif" alt="eTrust Click Seal. Click to read our profile" style="float:left;margin-right:10px"></a>
MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com are licensees of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the sites www.MyEvent.com and www.Websiteworks.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 
<br><br>
The visitors and the customers (the "User") of the MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com websites are in control of the use of information they provide to MyEvent.com, Websiteworks.com, or one of its current or future affiliate members ("Affiliate Members"). MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com are committed to respecting the privacy rights of Users to the MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com websites (the "Site"). While visiting the Site, we may ask Users to provide personal information ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 
<br><br>
Please see the Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from Users. To the extent that Users disclose any such information to other parties, through other web sites on the Internet linked to this site or otherwise, THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL NOT APPLY TO SUCH DISCLOSURE. Since MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com do not control the privacy policies of third parties (including Affiliate Members), Users are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of that third party, and MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of Personal Information by that third party. Therefore, we encourage Users to ask questions before they disclose Personal Information to other parties. 
<br><br>

<h4>Information Collected.</h4> These websites automatically collect and/or tracks various information, including but not limited to (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, and type of web browser used to access the Site; (2) the e-mail addresses of Users that communicate with us via e-mail, or users that posted messages to the MyEvent.com bulletin boards, or users that post messages to MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com chat groups; (3) Personal Information specifically provided by the User in online forms, registration forms, surveys, and contests entries, and (4) user-specific information on what pages Users access. 
<br><br>
When registering through the website as on the order form or the free trial form, we provide the option for the user to "opt out" of any non essential communications. These communications include newsletters, new product updates as well as special offers. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at info@myevent.com or at info@Websiteworks.com. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications through your Control Panel, or you may contact us at 514-282-7747, info@myevent.com or at info@Websiteworks.com or #305, 221 De La Commune ST W., Montreal, Quebec, H2Y 2C9 to opt-out. 
<br><br>

<br><br>

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We may also use this information to send you newsletters or updates on your account. Clients have the right to opt-out of non critical communications such as newsletters or new feature updates.

<br><br>

<h4>Surveys or Contests</h4>
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

<br><br>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. 
<br><br>
