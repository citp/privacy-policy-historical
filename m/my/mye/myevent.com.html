MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com are licensees of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the sites www.MyEvent.com and www.Websiteworks.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 
<br><br>
The visitors and the customers (the "User") of the MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com websites are in control of the use of information they provide to MyEvent.com, Websiteworks.com, or one of its current or future affiliate members ("Affiliate Members"). MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com are committed to respecting the privacy rights of Users to the MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com websites (the "Site"). While visiting the Site, we may ask Users to provide personal information ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 
<br><br>
Please see the Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from Users. To the extent that Users disclose any such information to other parties, through other web sites on the Internet linked to this site or otherwise, THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL NOT APPLY TO SUCH DISCLOSURE. Since MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com do not control the privacy policies of third parties (including Affiliate Members), Users are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of that third party, and MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of Personal Information by that third party. Therefore, we encourage Users to ask questions before they disclose Personal Information to other parties. 
<br><br>

<h4>Information Collected.</h4> These websites automatically collect and/or tracks various information, including but not limited to (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, and type of web browser used to access the Site; (2) the e-mail addresses of Users that communicate with us via e-mail, or users that posted messages to the MyEvent.com bulletin boards, or users that post messages to MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com chat groups; (3) Personal Information specifically provided by the User in online forms, registration forms, surveys, and contests entries, and (4) user-specific information on what pages Users access. 
<br><br>
When registering through the website as on the order form or the free trial form, we provide the option for the user to "opt out" of any non essential communications. These communications include newsletters, new product updates as well as special offers. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at info@myevent.com or at info@Websiteworks.com. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications through your Control Panel, or you may contact us at 514-282-7747, info@myevent.com or at info@Websiteworks.com or #305, 221 De La Commune ST W., Montreal, Quebec, H2Y 2C9 to opt-out. 
<br><br>
In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and/or create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 
<br><br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at info@myevent.com or at info@Websiteworks.com to request that we remove this information from our database. 
<br><br>
MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com is the sole owner of the information collected on MyEvent.com and Websiteworks.com. These websites collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 
<br><br>

<h4>Orders</h4>
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We may also use this information to send you newsletters or updates on your account. Clients have the right to opt-out of non critical communications such as newsletters or new feature updates. Client's may not opt out of critical emails such as notifications of account status, or notification of account upgrades and/or account cancellations. 
<br><br>

<h4>Surveys or Contests</h4>
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 
<br><br>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. 
<br><br>

<h4>Cookies.</h4> A "cookie" is an element of data which is a piece of text, not a program and that a website can send to the User's browser, which may then be stored on a User's computer system. The Site can access the information from a cookie sent to a User's computer system. MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com does place cookies on Users' computer systems. MyEvent.com/Websiteworks.com cannot access other cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. We use cookies to track usage of the Site and further customize User's experience when such is visiting the Site.

We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use a third-party live chat service called Liveperson that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate such as clickstream data in order to better serve our customers. We also use Google's keyword analytics to track clickstream data.
<br><br>

<br><br>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information for the security of These websites and their clients.
