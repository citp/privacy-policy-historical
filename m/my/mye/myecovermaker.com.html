				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>



<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the   Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the   Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete   confidence.</p>

<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to   privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects   information from all end users of our Internet services (the "Services")-those   who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as   those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to   the Service ("Members")-what we do with the information we collect, and the   choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such   information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is   Used</strong></p>

<p>Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from   Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the   network of Web sites accessible through our Service.</p>

<p><strong>Registration:Â&nbsp;</strong> Members may be asked to provide certain   personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including   name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card   number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services.   The personal information collected from Members during the registration process   is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This   information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in special   circumstances.</p>

<p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our   Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the   name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a   result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering you other products and   services.</p>

<p>In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any   other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from   personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total   number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we   may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements   that appear on the Services.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, to our   business partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member   purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner company.We   also may supply other companies with contact information, for mail offers we   believe would be of interest to our members, with or without compensation from   those companies.At times we may send an advertisement for a third party   product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the purchaser's   information to that third party.</p>

<p>Our Company Partners and Sponsors:Some products and services may be offered   to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor   seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these   products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal   information.</p>

<p><strong>Online Shopping:</strong>At some Web sites, you can purchase   products and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter,   catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to   provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone   number, and credit/debit card information.</p>

<p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent   directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the   recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company   has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you   provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.</p>

<p>If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the   personal information you provide to process that order.We do share this   information with outside parties that we do business with. </p>

<p><strong>Online Advertisements:</strong>Our company may display our online   advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors and   Members collected through the registration process as well as through online   surveys and promotions with these advertisers.</p>

<p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored   advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture   company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an   advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the information we have   collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended   audience. Our company does share personal information about its Visitors or   Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>

<p><strong>Responses to Email Inquiries:</strong> When Visitors or Members send   email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the   email inquiry we receive.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary Customer Surveys:</strong>We may periodically conduct   both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to   participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information   that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we   provide them to you.</p>

<p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our   Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other   customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey   questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,   industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated   information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new   services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information   may be shared with third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Promotions:</strong>Our company may offer polls, contests,   sweepstakes, drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by   or cobranded with third parties. You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest,   or other promotion, simply by making a purchase from us or by providing us with   personally identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. Due to   these third party relationships, the third parties may obtain personally   identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to our company. Our   company has no control over third parties' use of this information.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, personally identifiable information may be collected when you   order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion,   subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate   in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable   information that may be collected at these pages include but may not be limited   to: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card   information, and information about your interests in and use of various   products, programs, and services. Our sponsors or third parties may send you   material that relates to our company's services, products or activities.</p>

<p><strong>Special Cases:</strong>It is our company's policy to use or share   the personal information about Visitors or Members in ways described herein   without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise prohibit such   unrelated uses. </p>

<p>Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or   information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through   our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is   reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant   database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic   Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or   governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information   that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone   who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other   user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and   our Members.</p>
