### Privacy Policy

My EDU Connect is owned and operated by Vast Interactive, LLC.

Vast Interactive knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. By visiting Vast Interactive's primary Web site or related Web sites that Vast Interactive controls or operates (collectively “Vast Interactive Sites”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

#### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Vast Interactive’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Vast Interactive gathers when you are accessing Vast Interactive Sites and when you use Vast Interactive services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Vast Interactive’s treatment of any Personal Information that Vast Interactive’s business partners share with Vast Interactive. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties to which such information is provided by Vast Interactive that Vast Interactive does not own or control, or to individuals that Vast Interactive does not employ or manage.

#### What Personal Information Does Vast Interactive Collect And Maintain?

We collect the following types of information from our customers:

  * **Personal Information You Provide to Us:**  
We receive and store any information you enter on Vast Interactive Sites or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include name, address, phone number, and email address. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.
  * **Personal Information Collected Automatically:**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with Vast Interactive Sites or services. Vast Interactive automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to Vast Interactive Sites and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Vast Interactive uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Vast Interactive Sites or services so that we can make the Vast Interactive Sites appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers use Vast Interactive Sites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and Vast Interactive Sites, so that they, too, may seek to provide you with an optimal online experience. 

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Vast Interactive will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
