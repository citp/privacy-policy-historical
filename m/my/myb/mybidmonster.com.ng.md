### About SSL, security, and firewall problems                                                                                                 

Some older browsers (such as IE 3.0.2) have known SSL bugs. These can result in the browser crashing on SSL pages, compromise on security or giving error messages. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of whatever browser you prefer. For users behind corporate firewalls, you need to configure your web browser security settings. This includes setting https or secure proxy settings. To determine if you have such a security problem, you can edit a secure URL, replacing 'https' (secure) with 'http' (insecure). If the page works with http:// but not https://, then you have a problem with your security settings. You should contact your system administrator for assistance. ****

### How your information is encrypted                                                                                                               

There are certain areas on the site where you may enter and submit additional information. Certain of these areas are encrypted using SSL encrypted transmissions between your Web browser and our Web server. This is designed to reduce the chance that someone (e.g. on your network at work or at your Internet service provider) may try to compromise your private information as it travels from your Web browser to our secure server. You'll know when transmitted data is encrypted by a security notice when you enter an encrypted page, and by the presence of an icon on your browser, either a key for Netscape or a lock for Microsoft Internet Explorer. The pages where you submit your account information, place a bid, and receive confirmation of a successful bid are all encrypted. In addition, your credit card information is encrypted within the Mybidmonster.com database and access to such information is restricted. This system is unique and designed to provide you with additional security when purchasing items on MyBidmonster.com. ****
