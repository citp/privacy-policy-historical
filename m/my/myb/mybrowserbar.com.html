      <p>The MyBrowserBar Privacy Policy applies to your use of our Toolbar <strong>(“Toolbar”)</strong>, which is built and maintained by Spigot, Inc. <strong>(“We”)</strong>.  We care about your privacy and will never collect personally identifiable information or monitor usage on an individual level.<br>

      <p><span class="headermini">Information we collect during Toolbar Usage</span><br>
      We do not monitor the web pages you visit.  When you perform a search, your search may be sent through our servers in order to optimize the search result.  This will record the following anonymous usage information:</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>a)</strong>	Date and time of search<br>

      <p>In addition, your web browser will communicate to us the same information it gives to every web server on the Internet.  This could include information such as your computer hardware and software attributes, cookies for our site, and the URL of web page you are requesting.</p>
<p><span class="headermini">How we use the Information we collect</span><br>
      Information we collect from you is used on an aggregate basis and for reporting purposes only.  For example, we measure the total number of Toolbar installations per month in order to pay our partners, the total number of Toolbar searches conducted per month to measure growth patterns, the number of Toolbars used in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox per month to study browser trends, and so on.   All information is collected in aggregate and never measured on an individual basis.</p>         

      <p><span class="headermini">Information collected by Third Parties</span><br>
      Search results pages you visit when performing a search using the Toolbar are provided by our search engine partners (i.e. Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, eBay, Amazon).  These search engines can track the following:</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>a)</strong>	Search term that was entered into the search box<br>
        <strong>b)</strong>	Originating IP address and the user’s country or OS language setting<br>
        <strong>c)</strong>	Sponsored listings or other advertisements that were clicked on<br>
        <strong>d)</strong>	That the search request came from the [partner name] Toolbar and its associated revenue tag</p>
      <p><span class="headermini">No Spyware</span><br>
      The Toolbar does not collect personally identifiable information or monitor your surfing behavior. </p>
      <p><span class="headermini">No Adware</span><br>
      The Toolbar does not launch pop-up or pop-under advertisements, or any other obtrusive forms of advertising. </p>
      <p><span class="headermini">Use of Cookies</span><br>
      When you conduct a search using the Toolbar, our content providers who supply search results (i.e. Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, eBay, Amazon) may set or access cookies on your computer.  The cookies are used for the purpose of measuring referrals from our Toolbar on an aggregate basis and are not tied to your personal information.  Many browsers offer users the option of declining cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, please modify the settings in your browser. </p>
      <p><span class="headermini">Toolbar Updates</span><br>
      The Toolbar communicates with our servers from time to time to check for available software updates such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions and new versions. By installing the Toolbar, you agree to automatically request and receive updates.  If you wish to turn off automatic updates, you can do so from the “Options” menu in the Toolbar. </p>
