MyBrowserBar Privacy Policy

The MyBrowserBar Privacy Policy applies to your use of our Toolbar **(“Toolbar”)** , which is built and maintained by Spigot, Inc. **(“We”)**. We care about your privacy and will never collect personally identifiable information or monitor usage on an individual level.

  
The information We collect is for basic reporting purposes only, and includes the following:

**a)** Date and time of installation  
**b)** Date and time of un-installation  
**c)** Originating IP address and the user’s country at time of installation/un-installation  
**d)** Toolbar status in Internet Explorer or Firefox (i.e. if a Toolbar is hidden or displayed in the browser)  
**e)** Partner ID at time of installation   
**f)** Toolbar version at time of installation 

  
We do not monitor the web pages you visit. When you perform a search, your search may be sent through our servers in order to optimize the search result. This will record the following anonymous usage information:

**a)** Date and time of search  
**b)** Originating IP address  
**c)** Partner / Channel ID of your Toolbar  
**d)** Toolbar version  
**e)** Search term

In addition, your web browser will communicate to us the same information it gives to every web server on the Internet. This could include information such as your computer hardware and software attributes, cookies for our site, and the URL of web page you are requesting.

  
Information we collect from you is used on an aggregate basis and for reporting purposes only. For example, we measure the total number of Toolbar installations per month in order to pay our partners, the total number of Toolbar searches conducted per month to measure growth patterns, the number of Toolbars used in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox per month to study browser trends, and so on. All information is collected in aggregate and never measured on an individual basis.

  
Search results pages you visit when performing a search using the Toolbar are provided by our search engine partners (i.e. Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, eBay, Amazon). These search engines can track the following:

**a)** Search term that was entered into the search box  
**b)** Originating IP address and the user’s country or OS language setting  
**c)** Sponsored listings or other advertisements that were clicked on  
**d)** That the search request came from the [partner name] Toolbar and its associated revenue tag

  
The Toolbar does not collect personally identifiable information or monitor your surfing behavior. 

  
The Toolbar does not launch pop-up or pop-under advertisements, or any other obtrusive forms of advertising. 

  
When you conduct a search using the Toolbar, our content providers who supply search results (i.e. Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, eBay, Amazon) may set or access cookies on your computer. The cookies are used for the purpose of measuring referrals from our Toolbar on an aggregate basis and are not tied to your personal information. Many browsers offer users the option of declining cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, please modify the settings in your browser. 

  
The Toolbar communicates with our servers from time to time to check for available software updates such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions and new versions. By installing the Toolbar, you agree to automatically request and receive updates. If you wish to turn off automatic updates, you can do so from the “Options” menu in the Toolbar. 

  
You can easily uninstall the Toolbar in the traditional Add/Remove programs section in Windows, or from the Toolbar by selecting **Options > Help > Uninstall**.

  
You can easily hide or deactivate the Toolbar in Internet Explorer or FireFox by selecting View > Toolbars, and then unselecting the checkbox for the Toolbar. 

  
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a prominent notice on our site.

  
If you have questions or suggestions, please send us a note from our [contact us](http://www.spigot.com/contact.html) form.
