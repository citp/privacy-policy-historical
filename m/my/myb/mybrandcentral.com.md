# Privacy Policy - Brand Central

Our privacy policy is simple: we collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

## Submitting personal information is voluntary.

When you voluntarily submit information, it constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the purpose(s) stated at the time of collection.

For the protection of users of our Web sites, we have safeguards in place to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts to access or cause harm to information and systems.

## Information Collected and Stored Automatically

Our web server collects and saves only the default information customarily logged by World-Wide Web server software. Specifically, for each http request received, the date and time, the originating IP address, the object requested, and the completion status of the request is collected and saved.

We analyze these logs monthly to determine the traffic through the server during that month in hits, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages of interest during each month. We may also analyze accesses to particular pages to determine US versus non-US use, government agency versus private use, and other statistics that may be of value to us in establishing priorities and allocating resources in order to better accomplish our dissemination mission.

If you choose to provide us with personal information in e-mail, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not store any personal information independent of the e-mail message, create individual profiles with the information you provide, or give it to any private organizations. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.

## Use of Persistent Cookies and Tracking Technology:

We do not use persistent cookies or persistent tracking technologies, such as those used for session customization for returning visitors, on our website.
