### Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

You may choose to give us personally identifiable information online to allow us to communicate with you or provide you with services. Our online forms ask for a small amount of relevant information, such as name, email, and employer name. The member portal requests information including, but not limited to, direct deposit information, such as bank, account, and routing numbers, which are passed on to other parties and are not stored by us. Information collected in the member portal and stored by us would include, but is not limited to, email and physical addresses, coverage levels, telephone numbers, alternate contacts, communications with you and user IDs and passwords. Some of this information may be passed on to third parties who perform services for us.

We may also collect information about your visits to our websites, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and language, location information and details of your browsing patterns and communication data. This is more fully described under the section entitled “Cookies” below. We collect this information to determine such things as the number of visitors to various parts of our websites and to personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you.

Information collected and stored in the employer portal would include, but not be limited to, employee’s name, payroll information (such as employee and employer contributions), employer’s bank account information, profiles of persons with access to the employer’s portal (name, email and physical address, telephone numbers), and those persons’ user IDs and passwords. Employers can search the portals for their respective participants by fields which include, but may not be limited to, first and last names, SSNs, and payroll ID numbers, and search for when an account was opened and closed. The employer portal also has a function to send emails.

BenefitWallet does not direct its website or online services to children under 13 years old and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Website or on or through any of its features. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

Personally identifiable information collected is stored in the United States but may be accessed and processed in the United States or any other country in which Conduent or its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or partners maintain facilities, and by using this website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

The mobile native application automatically collects the IMEI number (or device number) of your mobile device so that we can uniquely identify your device.
