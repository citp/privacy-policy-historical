      <h3>MyBuys Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p> This privacy policy describes the privacy practices of MyBuys, Inc. (<strong>"MyBuys"</strong> or <strong>"we"</strong>) with respect to information we collect (a) from end users (<strong>"End Users"</strong>) through our clients' websites and (b) from the visitors of our corporate website (<strong>"Visitors"</strong>) located at <a linkindex="19" href="http://www.mybuys.com">http://www.mybuys.com</a> (<strong>"MyBuys Website"</strong>). End Users and Visitors are collectively referred to as "Users" in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our Users' privacy, we disclose the following information.</p>
      <p> 1. What personally identifiable information MyBuys collects. <br>
        2. What organization collects the information. <br>
        3. How MyBuys uses the information. <br>
        4. With whom MyBuys may share User information. <br>
        5. What choices are available to Users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information. <br>
        6. What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss,  misuse or alteration of information under MyBuys control. <br>
        7. How Users can correct any inaccuracies in the information under MyBuys control. </p>
      <p> <strong>"Personal Information"</strong> is information about you  that is personally identifiable to you like your name, address, e-mail  address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that  is associated with the foregoing.</p>
      <p>        <strong>"Anonymous Information"</strong> means information that is not associated with or linked to your  Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the  identification of individual persons. </p>
      <h4><strong>
        Information Collection from End Users and Use of such Information</strong></h4>
      <p>(This section describes how information is collected from you if you are an End User) </p>
      <p> MyBuys collects information regarding your use of, and your purchasers  on, our clients' websites. We collect this information through the use  of industry standard cookies and web beacons that exchange data between  your computer and our servers, based on instructions on our clients'  webpages. In other words, our clients enable their websites to allow us  to collect this information. </p>
      <p> We collect information about which products you view and  the products you purchase. When you complete a purchase with one of our  clients, we collect information reflecting the total amount of your  purchase, each product you purchased, your email address, and your  opt-in/opt-out preference. We do not collect your credit card number,  name, address or phone number (among other data points). We may store  this information as Personal Information.</p>
      <p> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer. For a  session cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply  terminates. A persistent cookie is stored on the user's hard drive for  an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by  following Internet browser help file directions. You can set your  browser to notify you to either accept or deny the cookie. A web beacon  can be any file that makes up part of a web page, but is usually an  electronic image (1x1 .gif), that helps website operators analyze  customer traffic and track transactions. </p>
      <h4>        <strong>Profiles</strong></h4>
      <p>        MyBuys compiles the  information it collects about you into a profile of your product  viewing and purchasing preferences. MyBuys associates your profile with  your email address, if your email address is known to us. If your email  address is not known to us and you browse our client's website, your  product interests will be tied to the cookie placed on the computer you  are using for the browsing, but not to your email address or other  personally identifiable information. We work with and for our merchant  clients and share email address information only with them. Except as  described herein, we do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose  your email address or other personally identifiable information to  third parties.</p>
      <h4>        <strong>Information Collection from Visitors and Use of such Information</strong> </h4>
      <p>      (This section describes how information is collected from you if you are a Visitor)</p>
      <p> If you use one of the forms on the MyBuys Website to contact us, we  will collect your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone  number and any question and/or comment you enter into the form. If you  send us an e-mail, we will collect any information that is contained in  such e-mail, including any attachments that you send to us with your  e-mail.</p>
      <p> In general, Personal Information you submit to us through the MyBuys  Website is used by us either to provide you with the information you  have requested, product and service information, information about  MyBuys, to improve the MyBuys Website and to better tailor the  features, performance and support of the MyBuys Website, and to offer  you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. </p>
      <h4>        <strong>Communications</strong> </h4>
      <p>      MyBuys may send  communications (including emails) (a) on behalf of its clients, to  those customers of its clients whose preferences allow such  communications and (b) to Visitors, if they have requested to receive  such communications. If you are an End User, MyBuys may use your  profile information to send communications that are most relevant to  your interests. </p>
      <h4>        <strong>Sharing Information </strong></h4>
      <p>        Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade,  rent, or share your personal information with third parties, unless you  ask or authorize us to do so. </p>
      <p> We may provide your personal information to third party service  providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some aspects of  our services and to help us communicate with you. However, these  service providers do not have any independent right to use or share  this information (except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a  subpoena or warrant). </p>
      <p> Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries,  joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively,  "Affiliates"), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your  personal information with these Affiliates, in which case we will  require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p> If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that  company will possess the personal information collected by us and it  will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal  information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p> We may disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith  that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or  to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or  defend the rights, property, or safety of MyBuys or any third party. </p>
      <p> We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information  by excluding information (such as your email address) that makes the  Personal Information personally identifiable to you. We may use and  disclose this Anonymous Information at our discretion. </p>
      <p> If you are an End User and would like to know (1) the categories of  Personal Information about you that we disclosed in the prior calendar  year to third parties for the purposes of the third parties' marketing  and/or (2) the names and addresses of such third parties, please  contact us. </p>
      <h4>        <strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong></h4>
      <p> You can opt-out of receiving future emails that we send on behalf of a  specific client or that we sent to you as a Visitor by following the  "unsubscribe" instructions in the emails we send. Note that your  opt-out preference applies with respect to that client only. </p>
      <h4>        <strong>Data Security </strong></h4>
      <p>        MyBuys maintains  reasonable physical security in our facilities to protect against the  loss, misuse, or alteration of information. However, we cannot  eliminate risks to your Personal Information.</p>
      <h4>        <strong>Client Websites </strong>        </h4>
      <p>Our clients have their own websites and their own privacy policies. We  are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of our  clients' websites. This privacy statement applies solely to information  collected by MyBuys. </p>
      <h4>        <strong>Changes to the Privacy Statement</strong></h4>
      <p>        The information you submit to us is controlled by the privacy policy in  effect at the time you submit it. If we significantly change our  policy, we will send you an email (if we have your email address)  notifying you of policy changes.</p>
