					<p><strong>UPDATED – March 15, 2012</strong></p>
<p><em>This Privacy Policy  explains the privacy practices of MyBuys, Inc. and how we collect, use, and  disclose information we collect from users of any of our corporate Clients’  websites or mobile websites (each, a “Client” and “Client’s Site”,  respectively) and users of our corporate website&nbsp; (</em><a href="http://www.mybuys.com/"><em>www.mybuys.com</em></a><em>) (“Corporate Site”).&nbsp; We take  your privacy seriously and want to help you understand what we do, our  practices, and the protections we use to safeguard data. </em></p>
                    <p><em>If you have questions  about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mybuys.com">privacy@mybuys.com</a> or write  to us at Chief Privacy Officer, MyBuys, Inc., 411 Borel Avenue, Suite 100, 
</em></p>
                    <p><em>As used in this  Privacy Policy, “PI” or “Personal Information” means data that allows someone  to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address,  telephone number, and e-mail address, as well as any other non-public  information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing  data.&nbsp; “Anonymous Information” means data  that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data.&nbsp; Anonymous Information does not, by itself,  permit the identification of individual persons.</em></p>
                    <p><strong><em>By using our services through a Client Site or our Corporate Site, you  agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the  processing collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information in  accordance with this Privacy Policy.</em></strong></p>
                  <p><em>This Privacy Policy is  effective as of March 15, 2012.</em></p>
                    <h4><strong>PORTION OF PRIVACY POLICY FOR  USERS OF CLIENTS’ SITES – SUMMARY</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                      MyBuys provides marketing and advertising services used by  retailers and other businesses.&nbsp; In  general, the data that we use is collected while you browse or buy on one of  our Clients’ Sites.&nbsp; For example, we pay  attention to the kinds of things you like to shop for and buy – what categories  (like T-shirts or digital cameras), what brands, and other details about those  items, such as whether they were on sale.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>We don’t collect sensitive data like credit card numbers,  social security numbers or even your name or address.&nbsp; We don’t collect data on sensitive topics  like your health, your finances or political views.&nbsp; We don’t collect Personal Information, except  for your email address.&nbsp; And we only  collect your email address if you’ve opted-in to receive emails from that  Client.&nbsp; You can opt-out of such emails  at any time by clicking the “Opt-Out” or “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of  every email we send on behalf of that Client.&nbsp;  We do not use your email to send you email marketing regarding MyBuys or  our other Clients, unless you have also opted-in to receive emails from any  such other Client.</p>
                    <p>We use the data we collect to determine your preferences,  which in turn enables us to make our marketing and advertising services more  useful to you.&nbsp; These services include  making product recommendations to you when you are on our Clients’ Sites, in  follow-up emails sent by our Clients or by us on our Clients’ behalf, in  advertisements sent by our Clients or by us on our Clients’ behalf, or in  direct mail pieces sent by our Clients.</p>
                    <p>We don’t sell, barter, or otherwise disclose your Personal  Information, except to our service providers, affiliates, in connection with  legal processes or protecting the rights of ourselves or any third parties, or  in connection with a merger or acquisition.&nbsp;  We may freely disclose Anonymous Information.</p>
                    <p>You can opt-out of having us automatically collect your data  for the purpose of serving personalized content to you at any time by clicking <a href="/opt-out">here</a>.  Please note that this doesn’t mean that you  won’t see ads or recommendations.&nbsp;  Rather, you’ll see a generic ad or recommendation in place of  personalized content because no data related to you individually will have been  used in our services. </p>
                    <p>We retain information that we collect about you only for as  long as it remains relevant to providing you recommendations and advertisements  or as required by law or to protect our rights.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>The foregoing Summary is meant to provide an overview of our Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; Please note that the Full  Privacy Policy below governs in the case of any discrepancy between the Summary  and the Full Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  Accordingly, please review the Full Privacy Policy for a complete  description of our privacy practices. </em></strong></p>
                    <h4><strong>PORTION OF PRIVACY POLICY </strong><strong>FOR  USERS OF CLIENTS’ SITES – FULL POLICY</strong></h4>
                    <p>                    This portion of our Privacy Policy for Users of Clients’  Sites describes the privacy practices of MyBuys with respect to information we  collect from you through our Clients’ Sites.&nbsp;  We understand that your privacy is important to you, and we strive to  safeguard and manage your Personal Information and data in a responsible  fashion. </p>
<p>To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, this Privacy  Policy describes:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>What Personal Information and Anonymous  Information we collect.</li>
                      <li>How we use your information.</li>
                      <li>What choices are available to you regarding  collection, use, and distribution of your information.</li>
                      <li>How we protect your information. </li>
                      <li>With whom we share your information.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h4><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h4>
                    <h4><strong>Types of Information</strong></h4>
                    <p>                  We collect information about you to enable our Clients to  provide compelling marketing and advertising services to you such as product  recommendations and personalized ads.&nbsp; We  believe the services that we power for our Clients improve your overall  shopping experience with them.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>Specifically, we may collect the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Your use of our Clients' Sites, including what  products you view and other online navigation data;</li>
                      <li>Your purchases on our Clients’ Sites;</li>
                      <li>Your interaction with emails sent by our Clients  or by us on our Clients’ behalf, including opening emails and clicking on  recommendations in the emails; </li>
                      <li>Your clicks on advertisements sent by our  Clients or by us on our Clients’ behalf;</li>
                      <li>Your email address if you have consented to  receive emails from our Client;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;Information from our Clients whose privacy  policies allow them to share Personal Information and/or Anonymous Information  about their customers with us, such as purchase history; and</li>
                      <li>Information from marketing partners and other  third party data providers whose privacy policies allow them to share Anonymous  Information about their customers with us, such as a consumer’s interests or  purchase behavior. </li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>Much of the information that we collect is automatically  generated by your computer or browser and collected by MyBuys.&nbsp; For example, when you visit an area of our  Client’s Site where our services are deployed, our servers automatically record  information that your browser sends.&nbsp;  These server logs include information such as Internet Protocol (“IP”)  address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer), the  date and time, whether one of our cookies is already set on your browser, your  browser type, and your interactions with our services.&nbsp; Your IP address provides us with geographic  location information.&nbsp; We also collect  information with cookies and pixel tags, as described below.&nbsp; If you have opted-in to receive email from  that Client, we also collect your email address.&nbsp; We don’t collect sensitive data like credit  card numbers, social security numbers, or even your name or address.&nbsp; We don’t collect data on sensitive topics  like your health, your finances or political views.&nbsp; Except for the collection of emails on an  opt-in basis only, we do not collect Personal Information through our  services.&nbsp; </p>
                    <h4><strong>Cookies and Pixel Tags</strong></h4>
                    <p>                      Much of the Anonymous  Information that we collect about you is through the use of industry standard  cookies and pixel tags.&nbsp; These  technologies enable the exchange of data between your computer or mobile device  and our servers, based on instructions on our Clients' Sites.&nbsp; In other words, our Clients enable their  Clients’ Sites to allow us to collect this information. </p>
                    <p>A “cookie” is a small data file that is stored on your  computer that contains an anonymous unique browser identifier.&nbsp; Cookies act as anonymous tags that identify  your computer, but not you personally. A “pixel tag” (also known as a web  beacon or clear GIF) can be any file that makes up part of a web page, but is  usually a small image (1x1 .gif).&nbsp; When  you access a web page that has a pixel tag, the pixel tag generates a generic  notice of your visit and permits us to set or read our cookies.&nbsp; Pixel tags are used in combination with  cookies to anonymously track the activity on a site by a particular computer.&nbsp; This helps website operators analyze customer  traffic and track transactions.</p>
                  <p>Cookies and pixel tags allow us to save your preference  information to improve the quality of our services and to allow our Clients to  offer you a better overall shopping experience.&nbsp;  The information that we collect from cookies only includes Anonymous  Information.&nbsp; We cannot and do not use  cookies to collect any Personal Information. </p>
                    <h4><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h4>
                  <p>                      In providing our services to you on behalf of our Clients,  we use both session cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; A session cookie expires when you close your  browser.&nbsp; A persistent cookie is stored  on your hard drive for an extended period of time.&nbsp; You can remove persistent cookies or set your  browser to notify you to either accept or deny cookies by following directions  provided in your internet browser’s “help” file.&nbsp; If you choose to disable cookies, we will not  be able to serve you personalized content. You can choose not to receive our  cookies and to opt-out of having us collect data and serve personalized content  at any time by clicking <u><a href="/opt-out">here</a></u>. Additional detail  regarding your choices regarding our collection of data is detailed in the “<a href="#your_choices">Your  Choices</a>” section below. </p>
                    <h4><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h4>
                    <p>                  We keep track of your buying  preferences by using the Anonymous Information we collect.&nbsp; If your email address is known to us because  you have opted-in to receive email communications from our Client, we associate  your Anonymous Information with your email address (while associated, such  information is Personal Information; and when not associated, such information  is Anonymous Information).&nbsp; If your email  address is not known to us and you browse our Client's Site, your product  interests will be tied to an anonymous cookie placed on your computer.&nbsp; Please note that we work with, and on behalf  of, our Clients and share email information only with them.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>We combine all of the information about you that we collect  and use that combined information to power our marketing and advertising  services.&nbsp; Some examples include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>To determine the best recommendations to show  you when you are on one of our Client’s Sites;</li>
                      <li>To provide more relevant advertisements;&nbsp; </li>
                      <li>On behalf of our Clients, to send personalized  communications (including emails) that are most relevant to your interests if  you have opted-in to allow such communications; </li>
                      <li>To track user trends and review the use of our  services;</li>
                      <li>To research ways to improve our services; and</li>
                      <li>To develop new products and technologies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>How Long We Keep Your Information</strong></h4>
                  <p>                    Except as otherwise permitted by law, we retain the  Anonymous Information that we collect about you only for as long as it remains  relevant to providing you recommendations and advertisements.&nbsp; This retention period may be indefinite.&nbsp; Our collection of Personal Information about  you is limited to the receipt of your email address when you have opted-in to  receive communications from our Client.&nbsp;  We will retain this information for as long as needed to provide  services to our Clients and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations  and protect our rights and property.</p>
                  <h4><strong><a name="your_choices" id="your_choices"></a>YOUR CHOICES</strong></h4>
                    <h4><strong>Opting out of Communications</strong></h4>
                  <p>                  You can opt-out of receiving future emails that we send on  behalf of a specific Client by following the “Opt-Out” or  "Unsubscribe" instructions in the emails we send.&nbsp; Note that your opt-out preferences apply with  respect to that Client only.</p>
                  <h4>Changing Your Email Address</h4>
                  <p>If you would like to change the address where you receive emails that we send on behalf of a specific Client, you can first opt out as described above and then subscribe again using your preferred email address.  Note that your change of address will apply with respect to that Client only.</p>
                  <h4><strong>Opting out of Tracking for Advertising and Recommendations</strong></h4>
                <p>                      You can opt-out of allowing us to collect preference data  when you browse any of our Clients’ Sites and at the same time opt-out of  receiving ads, product recommendations, or other communications based on that  data by clicking the button on <a href="/opt-out">this page</a>. </p>
                <p> By clicking this button, you will opt-out of receiving  cookies for all of our services, including our product recommendations and our  advertising services.&nbsp; If you choose to  opt-out, please note that you will receive a “persistent cookie” that tells us  not to recognize your browser.&nbsp; To  maintain your opt-out status, this cookie must be maintained on your  computer.&nbsp; If you manually delete your  cookies, you will delete this opt-out cookie and you must opt-out again for  your opt-out status to be recognized by us.&nbsp;  In addition, if you use a different internet browser or a different  computer, you will need to perform the opt-out task again.</p>
                <p>MyBuys uses the Evidon assurance platform (<a href="http://info.evidon.com/companies/mybuys" target="_blank">http://info.evidon.com/companies/mybuys</a>) to help comply with the cross‐industry Self‐Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). As part of this service, online advertisements served by MyBuys are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.</p>
<h4><strong>Client Websites </strong></h4>
                    <p>                  Our Clients have their own websites and their own privacy  policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of  our Clients' Sites.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy  applies solely to information collected by us when you visit our Clients’  Sites. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>PORTION OF PRIVACY POLICY FOR  USERS OF CLIENTS’ SITES OR CORPORATE SITE </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
                  <p>                      We take reasonable security measures to protect against  unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction  of data we collect and store.&nbsp; These  include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing  practices and security measures.&nbsp; Our  servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data  facilities to further increase security.&nbsp;  However, no security system is 100% secure.&nbsp; While we have taken reasonable measures to  safeguard the data we collect and store, we cannot guarantee that it will not  be disclosed or accessed inadvertently or through the unauthorized acts of  others.<br>
                      <br>
  <strong>SHARING INFORMATION </strong></p>
              <p>                  Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not  sell, trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties,  unless you or our Client (in accordance with its privacy policy) asks or  authorizes us to do so. </p>
                    <p><u>Service Providers.</u>&nbsp;  We may provide your Personal Information to third party service  providers who work on our behalf to provide some aspects of our services,  including to help us communicate with you.

                    <p><strong>Collection of Client Information&nbsp; </strong></p>
                  <p>                  Our  Clients are businesses, not individuals, and our Corporate Site collects  information from our Clients and prospective Clients who request information,  fill out ‘Contact Us’ forms, or otherwise contact us.&nbsp; We may collect information from you, such as  your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, professional title,  company name, and corporate website when you contact us for a demo.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you provide us feedback or contact us via  e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other  content included in the e-mail (e.g., your resume).&nbsp; </p>
                    <p><strong>Use of Client Information</strong></p>
                  <p>                  To the extent that Personal  Information (e.g., first and last name, telephone number, e-mail address, or  resume) is collected, we may use this to provide you with information that you  requested, to correspond with you about any questions or concerns you have brought  to our attention, to notify you of new services or updates to our existing  services, to send you administrative e-mail notifications, and to respond to  your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests.&nbsp; You can opt-out of receiving future marketing  emails that we send by following the “Opt-Out” or "Unsubscribe"  instructions in such emails (however we may continue to send you administrative  emails).&nbsp; We may create Anonymous Information  records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name)  that make the data personally identifiable to you.&nbsp; We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any of  your Personal Information to any third party for promotional purposes or  otherwise, except as expressly described above (e.g., to our service providers,  affiliates, in connection with legal processes or protecting the rights of  ourselves or any third parties, or in connection with a merger or acquisition)  or unless we obtain your prior consent.&nbsp;  In addition, we may share Personal Information when we believe such  action is appropriate to enforce customer agreements or to bill or collect for  services.&nbsp; We post customer testimonials  on our website which may contain Personal Information such as the customer’s  name.&nbsp; We obtain the customer’s consent  prior to posting the testimonial.&nbsp; Anyone  who has provided Personal Information through our corporate website may e-mail  us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mybuys.com">privacy@mybuys.com</a> to review, update,  delete, and/or correct his/her Personal Information.&nbsp; Please note that we may be required to keep  this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain  time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have  fulfilled such requirements).&nbsp; When we  delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may  remain in our archives.&nbsp; We may retain  your information for fraud or similar purposes. </p>
