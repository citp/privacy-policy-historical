The site may use Personally Identifiable Information (Name, e-mail, address, phone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.

How we collect and store information depends on the section of the site you’re visiting, the activities you take part and the services you select. For example, you may need to provide some personal info in order to access certain features or services, such as news bulletins, mailers or when you open a sports betting account. You may also need to provide information when you take part in contests or to access interactive areas of our site. Similar to many other sites, MyBookie also accrues info through the use of tools such as cookies and tokens that recognize and hold information from every visit.

### What we do with the collected info

For example, information regarding usage patterns can be combined with other info obtained from multiple users to help enhance our site and services. This helps Mybookie to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive and to communicate with costumers about their registration and customization preferences. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. Although, we will only use this information as permitted by law in these cases.
