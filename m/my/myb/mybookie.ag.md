The site may use Personally Identifiable Information (Name, e-mail, address, phone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.

How we collect and store information depends on the section of the site you’re visiting, the activities you take part and the services you select. For example, you may need to provide some personal info in order to access certain features or services, such as news bulletins, mailers or when you open a sportsbetting account.

Similar to many other sites, MyBookie.ag also accrues info through the use of tools such as cookies and tokens that recognize and hold information from every visit.
