### Privacy Policy

**Our Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use our service.** When you log into www.myBlueprint.ca using your school Activation Key or when you select your school from the Board Landing Page and create a “My Profile” (Profile), you have access to a resource that allows you to create goals and plans of action, save high school plans, track your progress towards graduation, save post-secondary opportunities and occupations of interest and other education planning related features. At this time, we collect the personal information such as: your name, email address, gender and grade. We may also ask you about your preferences for using our site, including whether or not you wish to receive newsletters and other information by email. To personalize your Profile and to enable potential features, we may in the future ask you for your date of birth, place of birth, student number and information about your hobbies and interests. We will also know, based on your Activation Key, your school and the city and province in which you go to school, and we may combine that information with information we have from your Profile.

We collect this information for a number of purposes: to send you occasional newsletters, to customize the content that you see, to provide you with information on a variety of relevant subjects including scholarships, jobs and health information, to conduct surveys and to offer promotions in which contestants may win prizes.

**We will not use your personal information for any other purpose without your consent (unless we are required to do so by law).**

### Cookies

We collect non-personal information and data automatically through the standard operation of our Internet servers and through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are small text files containing a unique identification number that identifies your browser – but not you – to our servers each time you visit our website. Cookies are not pervasive or invasive programs that enter a user’s system and damage files. They simply tell us which pages of our website are visited and by how many visitors. Cookies cannot, by themselves, disclose the individual identity of any user, and we never combine information gathered by a cookie with personally identifiable information like your name, telephone number or email address, without your consent.

### Use of Information by Others

**We do not sell your personal information.** We do not share it with others unless we have your permission to do so and, in some cases, if it has been approved by your School Board.

We may permit others to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through our website. Doublethink Inc. is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties, and you should check the Privacy Policy of such party before providing any personal information. We may transfer your personal information if Doublethink Inc. is acquired by or merged with another company; in that case, we will notify you prior to your personal information being transferred.

When submitting personal information on other websites, we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of those sites.

### Confidentiality and Security
