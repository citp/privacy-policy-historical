<p>PRIVACY POLICY<br>
  Effective DEC, 2006<br>
</p>
<p>Welcome to MybanglaMp3.com. We value your privacy, and want you to know what information we collect and what we do with it.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may make changes to this Policy. We will endeavor to<br>
  post the changes before they become effective. The effective date of the most recent version of the privacy policy will appear at the top of this page. This consumer privacy policy applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from any source.</p>
<p>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br>
  We have several areas where members can submit information to us, and we also have features that automatically collect information from our members and other users.</p>
<p>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US.<br>
  We have certain areas where we ask you to provide information to us:<br>
</p>
<p>* Communications with Us. We have features where you can submit information<br>
  to us (such as when contacting us with a question or problem related to the service). We will retain your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal purposes, and to help us to serve you better.</p>
<p>* Communications with Friends. Our site may also have certain features that allow you to send information to others (such as "Mail a song"). We will use the contact information you enter for your friends only to send the email, and then we will delete it from our system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION</p>
<p>Cookies. We use a software technology called "cookies" for several purposes, depending on the type of cookie employed. Within mybanglamp3.com, we use what are commonly called "session" cookies, meaning that they only last as long as you are online. We use these cookies to identify you as a valid subscriber so that we can deliver music to you, to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from another computer and to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration preferences (such as genre). We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide. As part of the sign-in process, we may also use what are commonly called "persistent" cookies which stay with you after your session is over and you are offline. We only use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your member name and password so that the next time you sign in, these fields will be prepopulated for you. This cookie is only offered in conjunction with certain Affiliate Sites that choose to make it available and it can only be activated if you select that option during your sign-in. If you select this option you can always deselect it each time you sign-in.</p>
<p>Other. In order to personalize our service for your enjoyment and to monitor and improve the performance of our technology, we do collect/capture other data such as a member's searches (such as their search criteria and results) and the music they listened to. We only share search history or music usage data on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p>For our internal purposes, we gather information such as date, time, connection speed and IP address of all visitors to our site. We keep this information simply for our internal security audit log, trend analysis, and system administration.</p>
