Privacy Policy
At KACHING KACHING, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the
security of the information you submit to us. We want your use of the KACHING KACHING

efforts to keep your information confidential and secure at all times within our system.

Like most every web site, the KACHING KACHING web site records certain tracking
information any time someone visits the site. For every web page that is viewed, our web
server records an IP address, the operating system, browser version and the name of the
page that was viewed. This information is not linked to any specific user and is used in the
aggregate to maintain, track performance and improve the KACHING KACHING web
service.
Cookies


A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored by your browser on your computer's
hard drive. KACHING KACHING uses cookies for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying
our users and securing their personal information. We also use cookies to track your order
process without requiring reentry or re-verification of contact or password information on
each page of the site. Rather than storing this information on KACHING KACHING's server,
the cookie is stored in your computer and is activated only when you visit the KACHING
KACHING site. Your privacy and security are not compromised when you accept a cookie
from the KACHING KACHING web site. No one can access the information except
KACHING KACHING.

KACHING KACHING Website Security
The KACHING KACHING web site uses secure sockets layer (SSL) to encrypt the transfer
of sensitive information, such as your account password and billing information, from your
web browser to our web server. Only the last four (4) digits of your credit card number will
be displayed in your account. Emails you send to us may not be secure unless otherwise
told that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For this
reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as credit card numbers
through emails.

In addition to the circumstances described above, KACHING KACHING may disclose or
release information when we, in good faith, believe that doing so is reasonably necessary:
(i) to comply with the law; (ii) to enforce or apply the terms of User Agreement; or (iii) to
protect the rights, property or safety of kachingkaching.com, our users, or others. By using
our web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by KACHING KACHING
as described in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our policy, we will post those
changes here so you will always know what information we gather, how we use it and under
what circumstances we disclose it.
