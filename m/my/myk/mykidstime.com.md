# Privacy Policy - MyKidsTime

Mykidstime Limited (we) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

## Information we may collect from you

_We may collect and process the following data about you:_

  * information that you provide by filling in forms on our site www.mykidstime.ie (site). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by Mykidstime Limited, and when you report a problem with our site;
  * if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;

## IP addresses and cookies

We may collect information about your computer for system administration. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us: to estimate our audience size and usage pattern; to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests; to speed up your searches; and to recognise you when you return to our site.

Cookies have been used by websites for many years, but [EU law](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:NOT) now asks us to inform you and confirm you are OK with this. If you register with us or if you continue to use our site, you agree to our use of cookies.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site. Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.

## Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, fulfilment of your order, processing of your payment details and provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and you cannot share it with anyone.

Unfortunately, transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

## Users

It will only be supplied by us to third parties either: (a) for the purposes of any competition you have entered, in which case we will first ask your permission; or (b) if we are under obligation by law to disclose it. We will never sell your email address or other personal information to third parties. Your information is collected and stored according to prevailing data protection laws.

_We use information held about you in the following ways:_

  * to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
  * to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes;
  * to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;
  * to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so;
  * to notify you about changes to our service.



If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. If you are a new customer we will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.

If you do not want us to use your data in this way please contact us at enquiries@mykidstime.ie.

## Disclosure of your information

  * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
  * if Mykidstime Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mykidstime Limited, our customers, or others.
