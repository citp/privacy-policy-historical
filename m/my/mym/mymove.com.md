**1\. Collecting and Using Personal Information from Website Visitors**

In order to provide you with access to certain services or data within our Sites, we may require that you provide certain personal information. This information may include your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, credit card number, subscriber name or screen name and password used to access our services.

The Personal Information you provide when you become a registered user or customer of the Site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience, increase the convenience of accessing new tools, products and services and, if applicable, provide the products and/or services you purchase or request. This personal information may also be used to make your use of the Site more convenient by, for example, limiting the number of times you have to register with us. If registration is available and you register with the Site, you will be assigned a unique identifier in our record system, that, together with your password, is designed to prevent unauthorized access to any information you choose to store on the Site. The data you give us about your personal preferences and demographics (e.g., ZIP code, occupation or the like) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that we believe will be of interest to you. Also, we may share this information with our current and potential advertisers so that they can present advertisements more effectively.

In addition, we collect information provided by visitors in registration forms, surveys, contest entries, emails, and other submissions to us. If you choose to participate in these surveys, contests, or other submissions, we may request certain personal information from you.  Participation in these offers is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), notify contest winners and award prizes, and to send participants emails.

We also collect and track automatically (1) the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client computer, and type of web browser of visitors to our Sites, and (2) aggregate and specific information on what pages visitors access.

Personal information we collect through our Sites will be used to, among other things, fulfill orders and requests for information, for marketing and promoting products and services of Imagitas and other entities that we believe you may find of interest, for feedback purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development or enhancement, for content improvement, to notify you of upcoming events and to customize content and layout of our Sites. Names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected through our Sites may be used to contact you regarding products and services and upcoming events we believe you might find of interest.

We also may use the personal information you provide for our internal purposes, such as administration and operation of our Sites, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures.

We may combine (1) your personal information with other non-personal information collected from and about you on the Site, and (2) online and offline information collected from and about you.

**2.   Collecting and Using Other Information** Imagitas uses several automatic data collection tools and techniques including cookies, clickstream, and web beacons. ****

These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to __ remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication, and to customize user experiences _._ Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

**Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve site functionality.

**  Behavioral Advertising**

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

**  Local Storage**

We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LS such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

**Single Sign-On**

You may log in to the Site using sign-on services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.  These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our registration form.  These sign-on services may also give you the option to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page to share with others in your network.

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Site may include social media features such as the Facebook Like button or other features that allow you to share content or experiences on our Site or interact with our Site using the feature.  These features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the social media feature to function properly.  These social media features are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.  Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing the feature.

**3.   Sharing Personal Information**

We do not share or otherwise disclose personal information about our Site visitors, except as described here or where permitted by law.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

In these situations, Imagitas will only use your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Statement, but the third party may use the information in different ways. You can tell when a product or service is offered by a third party, because a page or relevant portion of the page on the Sites  will display the third party's logo and/or name along with our own, or you will be linked to the third party's site to complete the transaction. Your personal information will be shared with these third parties only when you elect to participate in the joint offer or third party offer.  Please be aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding the use and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Statement.

Referrals: If you opt in to participate in any referral service we may offer, we use the information you submit to determine which of our participating professional(s) may be able to serve your needs. We may then forward your information, which may include personal information, contained on our sign-up form to certain professional(s), who may then contact you via email or telephone regarding the service.

Personal information may also be transferred in connection with a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale involving any Imagitas business or asset to which the information pertains.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
