## 1.  **Collecting and Using Personal Information**

_Information You Provide Voluntarily_

Certain features of the Site are only available to our registered users, and to access those areas of the Site you may be required to go through a registration and log-in process, after which you may log into the Site or certain features or areas thereof using your username and email password. You may also be required to provide personal and/or demographic information as part of the registration or log-in process. Personal information is information that can be used to identify you individually, and may include information like your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, credit card number, subscriber name or screen name, and password used to access the Site.

We may also collect information provided by visitors in registration forms, surveys, sweepstakes, games or other contest entries, emails, texts, and other submissions or electronic messaging to us. If you choose to participate in any such activities, or if you choose to otherwise access or use any part of the Site or any of the services provided on or through the Site, we may receive or request certain personal information from you, including information like your contact information, date of birth, geolocation, past, present or future postal address, moving date and related information, information about other people like your friends and family members, information about your hobbies and interests, and information about past, present or future activities or events undertaken by you, and/or other people like your friends or family members.

Participation in all Site services and activities is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

_Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect and track automatically (1) the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client device, and type of web browser of visitors to our Site, and (2) aggregate and specific information on what pages visitors access. We may combine your personal information with other information collected from and about you on the Site, from third parties, or from other online and offline sources.

_Cross-Device Data Linking_

We may also receive, use, or transfer data collected from one device to other devices that may be linked to or associated (i.e., through a common IP address) with the same user of the device where data was collected. We use the term “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile devices, as well as Internet browsers and other applications on your devices that interact with the Internet.

## 2.  **Methods of Information Collection**

The information collection described above may use several automatic data collection tools and techniques, including cookies, clickstream, and web beacons.

  * Cookies and Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Company and our partners and affiliates, or by analytics applications. These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and other websites, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g., language preference) and customize their experiences, as well as for user authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Site may be limited.
  * Log Files: Like many websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you, in part to improve Site functionality and the services we make available to you.
  * Behavioral Advertising: If you would like to generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, please visit the opt-out pages on the NAI website and the DAA website or click the following: NAI’s opt-out tool: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>DAA’s opt out tool: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>
  * Local Storage: We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LS such as HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
  * Single Sign-On: You may log in to the Site using sign-on services such as Google Sign-In, Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us to pre-populate our registration form, such as your name and email address. These sign-on services may also give you the option to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page for sharing with others in your network.
  * Social Media Widgets: Our Site may include social media features such as the Facebook Like button and/or other features that allow you to share content or experiences on our Site or interact with our Site using the feature. These features may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the social media feature to function properly. These social media features are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.
  * Data Analytics: We use certain web analytics services, including third-party services such as Google Analytics, to help us understand and analyze how visitors use the Site. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on both an individual and aggregated basis. These analytics services, including third-party services such as Google Analytics, also use this information to place advertisements for our products on other websites that you visit after your use of the Site. These advertisements may be based on the pages you visited during your use of the Site. For further information about how Google may use data it collects through the Site you may visit <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites>. You also may choose to install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to opt out of Google Analytics data collection, by visiting <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>. Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal when you visit various websites or use online services. Like many websites, this Site is not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers. To learn more about “Do Not Track” signals, you may wish to visit <http://www.allaboutdnt.com/>.

We may also share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties. If you opt in to participate in any referral service we may offer, we use the information you submit to determine which of our participating professional(s) may be able to serve your needs. We may then disclose your information, which may include personal information, contained on our sign-up form to certain professional(s), who may then contact you via telephone, email, or other electronic communication regarding the service. In any or all cases of such disclosure(s) to a third party described in this Privacy Policy, we may be compensated for such disclosure(s), and your information will become subject to the information collection, retention, use and disclosure practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your information. We may sell or purchase assets during the normal course of our business. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to obtain the transferee’s agreement to use personal information provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. California Privacy Rights: California law permits customers in California to request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, if the personal information is shared for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us in writing at 1101 Red Ventures Drive, Fort Mill, SC 29707, Attn: Privacy Officer, or [privacy@redventures.com](mailto:privacy@redventures.com). To make a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident, and provide your current California address to which we will send our response. Your inquiry must specify “California Privacy Rights Request” in the subject line of the email or the first line of the letter, and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.

## 5.  **Protecting Personal Information**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain reasonable generally-accepted administrative, technical and physical measures to safeguard the information we collect from and about our customers and Site visitors. While we make every effort to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you choose to create an account on our Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your password or account information.

## 6.  **Transferring Personal Information to Other Countries**

The country in which you are doing business with us or where the Site you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal information.

## 7.  **Blogs and Public Forums**

Our Site may offer publicly available blogs, bulletin boards, chat rooms, ratings or reviews, or other community forums.
