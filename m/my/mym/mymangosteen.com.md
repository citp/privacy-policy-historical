Kids under 13 (Special Note to Parents)

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect information from children under thirteen years of age without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Parents, or legal guardians, may provide us with consent to collect such information by email, by facsimile or by posted mail. Parents may request to review information collected from their child, may ask to have that information deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of the child's information. To request such review or to give instructions regarding the information we have collected about a child, parents or legal guardians should contact us.

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to this or any other website. Although guests under eighteen years of age may be allowed, with their parent's permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to that guest's parent or guardian. Parents should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help supervise their children's online activities. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Information for Consumers" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page.
