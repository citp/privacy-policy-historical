# Privacy Policy - MyMiniLife

MyMiniLife, Inc (the "Company") is committed to ensuring the privacy of those who use the MyMiniLife website ("Users"), located at http://www.MyMiniLife.com (the "MyMiniLife Site"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes what information is collected from Users and how that information is used and disclosed. By using the MyMiniLife Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy. 

## Authorized Users

The MyMiniLife Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old you may not register with or otherwise provide personal information to our Site.

## Information We Collect

  1. **User Provided Information.** You may provide to Company what is generally called "personally identifiable" information if you register. In addition, Company may give you the option to provide us with certain demographic information about yourself.
  2. **Aggregate Data.** Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data. Company uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand member needs so we can provide better features and services. Company may also share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the MyMiniLife Site.
  3. **General User Data.** General User Data, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the date and time of your visit, may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies" (small files that are stored on your computer by a website to give you a unique identification). Cookies also keep track of services you have used, record registration information regarding your login name and password, ensure you do not repeatedly see advertisements, record your preferences and keep you logged into the MyMiniLife Site. We treat general user data as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifying information mentioned above and, in those cases, will only use it as aggregate data.
  4. **Third Party Collected Data.** We may use, and allow third parties to use, web beacons on the MyMiniLife Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages, web-based documents, or in email messages that allow us or third parties to monitor who is visiting the MyMiniLife Site or if the email has been read. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information. We may also use third-party ad servers or network advertisers, to deliver ads to you. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you.

In all cases we limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and we require these parties to use any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
