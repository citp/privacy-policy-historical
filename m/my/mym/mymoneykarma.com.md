Telangana treats personal information that we collect / receive / retain.

MyMoneyKarma's privacy policy is governed by one fundamental principle - maintain your trust and confidence when handling your personal information

* What Information Do We Collect

We collect two types of online information: non-personal and personal.

  1. Non-Personal Information

This information helps us provide an online experience that matches your device and to manage our online advertising.

    1. When you visit digital properties we own / control (e.g. our website, mobile app etc), we typically collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet, information such as what browser, browser version, operating system you have, the website you came from or the advertisement you viewed or clicked on.
    2. When you browse the MyMoneyKarma website, view our emails/SMS, use your mobile site/app, MyMoneyKarma or the companies we work with, use cookies and/or pixel tags to collect information and store your online preferences. Cookies are widely used and most browsers are set up to accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to not accept cookies. It's important to note that cookies and pixel tags do not capture any information that can personally identify you.
    3. We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain services
  2. Personal Information

In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you explicitly provide and share with us - such as your name, address, phone number, and email address. Collecting this personal information enables us to offer you a digital experience that will help us to deliver our services to you.. For example, we collect personal information when you:

    1. Register / Apply for our services
    2. Applying for a new product /service from us or from our lender partners


* How do we collect this information

We collect non-personal information on our owned properties (MyMoneyKarma website, mobile app etc) and from third parties. There are certain industry standard technologies we use to collect usage Information. In the future, other new technology and methods for collecting Usage Information may develop.

  1. Embedded Scripts.

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

  2. Web Beacons.

Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web or mobile page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count users of the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie web beacons to Personal Information. We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site

  3. Cookies

You can control whether to accept cookies or not. If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can:

    1. Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it
    2. Set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies
  4. Targeted Advertising

Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. We believe that online behavioral advertising helps to provide you with more relevant advertising based upon on the websites you visit. We place advertisements by developing and using our own customer segmentation methodologies that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers. In addition, we may use marketing segments provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.

We contract with third-party advertising networks, publishers and other entities to advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us. Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to avoid targeted advertising provided by, or through them. Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising - which serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information. Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites (including our own websites that part of our own Services) and your response to our advertisements. Cookies placed by these companies do not collect Personal Information. We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.

  5. Do Not Track

Although there is no standard for how Do Not Track consumer browser settings should work on commercial websites, the industry has self-regulatory initiatives designed to provide consumers a choice in the types of ads they may see online and to conveniently opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all of the companies participating in these programs. Many of our advertising vendors and companies participate in these programs. Using the choice mechanisms these programs make available may help you see advertising that is relevant to you or help you avoid seeing interest based advertising generally. In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.

  6. Information Third Parties Provide About You

We may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

  7. Social media widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.
