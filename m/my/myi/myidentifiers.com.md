## Data Gathering & Usage

Bowker collects the domain names and e-mail addresses (where possible) of visitors and subscribers to our websites and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. We aggregate information on what pages visitors and subscribers access or visit, as well as information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey information and/or site registrations).

The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our websites, used to compile internal statistical and usage information, used to notify visitors and subscribers about updates to our websites, used to inform visitors and subscribers of other Bowker products or services they may be interested in, and used to inform visitors and subscribers of helpful products or services offered by others. Visitors and subscribers who provide their mailing address, telephone number, and/or e-mail address may be contacted for these purposes using any of these methods.

Electronic "cookies" are codes placed on your hard drive to enable sites to recognize if you have been there before. Cookies are given to visitors and subscribers of our websites so that Bowker can keep track of the domain from which people visit.

We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies or third party advertising agencies that track certain Internet activity.

From time to time, we may use information collected and supplied by visitors and subscribers for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our websites to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.

## Google Analytics and Remarketing

We use a service provided by Google called Google Analytics (GA). GA permits us to reach people who have previously visited our site, and show them relevant advertisements when they visit other sites across the Internet in the Google Display Network. This is often called ‘remarketing’.

Cookies can be used to track your session on our website, to serve customized ads from Google and other third party vendors. When you visit this website, you may view advertisements posted on the site by Google or other third parties. Through first-party and third party cookies, these third parties may collect information about you while you are visiting this website and other websites. They may use this data to show you advertisements on this website and across the Internet based on your prior visits to this website and elsewhere on the Internet. We do not collect this information or control the content of the advertisements that you will see.

You may be able to opt out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Ads Preferences Manager (<http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>), and the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (<http://www.google.ca/ads/preferences/plugin/>).

Your use of this website without opting out means that you understand and agree to data collection to provide you with remarketing ads using GA and cookies from other third party vendors based on your prior visits to this website and elsewhere on the Internet.
