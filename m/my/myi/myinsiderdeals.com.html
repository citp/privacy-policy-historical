                        telephone number, age bracket, day and month of birth. 
                        All registrants may receive e-mail confirming their registration, 
                        and subsequent correspondence. If you do not want to receive 
                        e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using 
                        the unsubscribe option on the bottom of every email. Certain 
                        information, such as your e-mail address, is collected 
                        in order to, among other functions, verify your identity 
                        in the future within our database. When you select to 
                        receive information about offerings from a third party 
                        company during the registration process, we will share 
                        your personal information with that third party company 
                        to carry out your information request. MyInsiderDeals.com 
                        may also use such information to directly market certain 
                        offers to you (via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing), 
                        to monitor compliance with our Terms and Conditions and 
                        for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may 
                        sell the personal information that you supply to us and 
                        we may join together with other businesses to bring selected 
                        retail opportunities to our members. These businesses 
                        may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of 
                        direct marketing services and applications, including 
                        lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and 
                        validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. 
                      </p><p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to 
                        perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include 
                        sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate 
                        information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing 
                        marketing analysis. These agents have access to our members’ 
                        personal information as needed to perform their functions 
                        for MyInsiderDeals.com, but we do not permit them 
                        to use our members’ personal information for other 
                        purposes.</p>
                      <p>MyInsiderDeals.com reserves the right to release 
                        current or past member information in the event MyInsiderDeals.com 
                        believes that the membership is being or has been used 
                        in violation of the Website’s terms and conditions, 
                        or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed,

                        MyInsiderDeals.com deems it necessary or appropriate. 
                        By agreeing to these conditions, you hereby consent to 
                        disclosure of any record or communication to any third 
                        party, when MyInsiderDeals.com, in its sole discretion, 
                        determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, 
                        without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other 
                        third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with 
                        the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, 
                        and Federal Trade Commission enabling regulations.</p>
                      <p>In addition, by registering at the Website, you agree 
                        that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application 
                        for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 
                        CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the 
                        “Rule”). Notwithstanding that your telephone 
                        number may be listed at the Federal Trade Commission’s 
                        Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via 
                        telemarketing in accordance with the Rule.</p>
                      <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information 
                        about you from outside sources and add it to your existing 
                        registration information on file at the Website. We do 
                        this to improve personalization of our services (for example, 
                        providing better newsletter content, advertising and/or 
                        special offers that we think may be of interest you).</p>
                      <p>We may also collect other information such as your IP 
                        address, domain names, access times and referring third 
                        party website addresses. This information is used by MyInsiderDeals.com 
                        for the operation of the Website, to maintain the quality 
                        of our offerings, and to provide general aggregate statistics 
                        regarding MyInsiderDeals.com. Such information is 
                        not personally identifiable. </p>
                      <p>We also collect information such as the identification 
                        of the server that your computer is logged onto and whether 
                        you opened a MyInsiderDeals.com e-mail message delivered 
                        to you. We also may compare our member list to various 
                        lists received from other third party companies, in an 
                        effort to avoid sending identical or similar e-mail messages 
                        to our members.</p>
                      <p>When you obtain any product or service directly from 
                        MyInsiderDeals.com, we collect certain financial 
                        information, such as your credit card number, credit card 
                        expiration date and billing address. Financial Information 
                        that you disclose to MyInsiderDeals.com is used to 
                        confirm your age and to bill you for shipping our products 
                        and services. To the extent that customer credit card-specific 
                        information is collected by MyInsiderDeals.com, said 
                        information will be kept in confidence and will not be 
                        shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit 
                        agencies) without your prior informed consent. Notwithstanding 
                        the foregoing, MyInsiderDeals.com reserves the right 
                        to share with third parties the fact that we have credit 
                        card information on file for specific customers but we 
                        will not share the specific credit card information with 
                        third parties without your prior informed consent. </p>

                        MyInsiderDeals.com may employ "cookies" 
                        to help customize your access to the Website. A cookie 
                        is a piece of data stored on a your hard drive containing 
                        information about you. Cookies have many benefits to enhance 
                        your experience at our Website. For instance, by setting 
                        a cookie on our Website, a member would not have to log 
                        in a password more than once, thereby saving time while 
                        on our Website. Even in the case where a member rejects 
                        a cookie, they may still use our Website. The only drawback 
                        to this is that the member will be limited in what he/she 
                        can access in some areas on our Website, much like visitor-level 
                        access. </p>
                      <p>We occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and 
                        target the interests of our members to further enhance 
                        the experience on our Website or for advertising tracking 
                        purposes. To find out more about cookies, please visit

                        web surfing behavior on this Website and other websites 
                        you may visit later on. That information is used to anonymously

                        to keep track of your response to each ad. None of these 
                        third parties are able to use this information to identify 
                        you personally. One such company is AlmondNet. If you'd
