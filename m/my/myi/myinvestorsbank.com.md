### _Our Web site: Investors Bank_

We do not collect personal information from visitors to our Web site without their knowledge. The information you provide to us on our Web site and during your Investors Online internet banking session is done so voluntarily so that we may provide you with a product or service for which you have expressed an interest or to complete a transaction that you have initiated.

Our website may provide links to products and services which are offered through nonaffiliated third parties. We have no control over third parties or their web sites. Once you leave our web site, you should review the security and privacy policies of the nonaffiliated third party.

  


### _Use of "Cookies"_

A "cookie" is a small piece of information that may be created when you visit a web site, and may or may not be written to your computer's hard drive. Depending on the type of information collected, if it is stored on your hard drive it can be retrieved when you revisit the site. Another type of "cookie" is used to enhance performance of a web site. It is written to your browser only (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc.) and expires when you terminate your internet session. This is the type of "cookie" we use to monitor the activity of Investors Online during your session. If there is no activity for a predetermined period of time, your session will timeout and you will be automatically logged off. No personal information is collected about you, nor can personal information be retrieved from your computer through the use of the "cookie".

  


### _Investors Online and Bill Paying Service_

We take every precaution to ensure that your banking sessions are performed in a secure environment through a secure server. Our Web site provides secure communication and has a valid certificate (Verisign). Secure communication means that information you provide and transmit over the Internet, such as your account number or other personal information, is encrypted using the highest level of 128-bit encryption so that it cannot be intercepted and read by other people. The certificate is a statement guaranteeing the security of the Web site and contains information that a specific Web site is authentic. This ensures that no other site can assume the identity of the original site. We also require a User ID, and additional authentication to access Investors Online. To maintain the security of your account information, we ask that you take the following precautions: (1) Do not share your User ID and/or password with anyone. If you do, you are authorizing the Bank to perform transactions for that person, just as if you requested it; (2) Change your password regularly; and, (3) Remember to sign off after your session.

  


### _Security Reminder_

Our employees will never ask you for your password. We will never use e-mail to ask you for any personal or financial information. If you believe someone has obtained any of your personal or financial information regarding your accounts with us, or your User ID and/or password, contact us immediately at **855-iBank4U (422-6548).**

  


### _Secure Messaging_

Our website features a secure message system which allows you to send messages to us using 128-bit encryption to transmit the messages securely over the internet. You may send a secure message to us by selecting the "Contact Us" button available throughout our website. However, since we cannot send an encrypted message back to you, should we need to respond with any non-public personal information, we will use alternate means such as telephone or US Postal Mail.

  


### _Regular E-mail_

You should know that e-mail is not transmitted through a secure server and could be intercepted by a third party. When you send e-mail to us or others, you should not include personal or confidential information, such as account numbers or social security numbers.
