The following information is to help users and visitors (collectively "Users" or "You") understand how we collect, use, disseminate, and safeguard the information You provide to us while accessing and using our MyHuckleberry.com, Inc. software, services, the website at www.myhuckleberry.com (the "Website"), and any other websites and services as may be added from time to time (collectively, "Service"). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the MyHuckleberry.com, Inc. End User License Agreement ("License Agreement"). Your use of the Service and any personal information You provide on or through the Service remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our License Agreement. 

1\. Information Collection 

MyHuckleberry.com, Inc. collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services, participate in our contests, surveys, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with us. If you choose, you can visit MyHuckleberry.com, Inc., without providing us with any information about yourself. MyHuckleberry.com, Inc. collects both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information from users of its Website. 

You may provide certain personally identifiable information to MyHuckleberry.com, Inc. directly, such as your first and last name, telephone number, address, and email address (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information") when choosing to register, purchase, or use Services, participating in promotions or surveys, or subscribing to any newsletters or other distribution lists. 

When you register with MyHuckleberry.com, Inc., we require you to give us contact information (such as your name, email address, or physical address). We may require additional information for specific promotions or contests run on our Website. 

We may use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with a service provider, and to send you, if you so choose, information about our company, newsletters, promotional materials, and information from the service provider network. 

We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside records, to notify you about important changes to the Website, new MyHuckleberry.com, Inc., services and products, and special offers and information we think you'll find valuable. We may send you information in conjunction with third-party partners that we think is relevant to your interests. 

We may use information gathered at the time of purchase to process your order, to enable the provider to fulfill your order, and to notify you of your order status. A customer care representative or service provider may contact you in order to fulfill a service you purchased or to provide information you requested. 

Any graphics, text, files, or any other content submitted, transmitted, or uploaded to the public areas of the Website or through the Website by Users ("User Submissions"), or other material that You make accessible to others directly, becomes published and public information that is not protected as "Personally Identifiable Information." Be aware that if your User Submissions includes personal information, such as your name and email address, other Users will have access to it and it will not be protected Personally Identifiable Information. 

When You visit our Website and use our Service, we may collect and store that information, including the following: 

a. Cookies. When You visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that identifies your web browser. You can set your web browser to refuse cookies; however, this may limit the functionality our Website can provide to You. 

b. Log Files. Your web browser automatically reports log file information each time You view a web page. When You register with or use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever You visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your IP address, browser type and language, number of clicks, domain names of websites visited, pages viewed, and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time. 

c. Clear Gifs. When You use the Service, we may use clear gifs (also known as “web beacons”) to collect information. 

Information collected through clear gifs and cookies, and log file information is largely non-personally identifiable information because such information is not collected or used in such a way that an individual User can be identified, for example, by name or email address (collectively, "Non-Personally Identifiable Information"). 

For example, Non-Personally Identifiable Information may be the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, the referring site from which you came (like a partner site), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (like America Online or EarthLink). 

We use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we collect in the aggregate to improve the design and content of our site. We also use this information to analyze site usage. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

2\. Use of Information 

Collected information is used to operate, maintain, and provide to You the features and functionality of the Service. Any information or User Submissions that You submit to the Website (including on discussion boards or forums, in blogs, messages and chat areas, and other areas) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other Users, who may forward this information or User Submissions to other websites or people, making it available to the general public and, therefore, it will not be protected Personally Identifiable Information. 

We may use your Personally Identifiable Information for billing, administrative purposes, such as notifying You of major changes in Service, news, and for other customer service purposes. You hereby consent to our use of your email address to send you such information. 

We may use collected information to: (a) remember information so that You will not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the Website; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) track User Submissions, and status in any promotions, sweepstakes, and contests; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) access your information after You sign in; (h) market our Service to advertisers and other third parties; and (i) to improve the quality and design of the Service and to create new features by storing, tracking, and analyzing your preferences and trends.

To process your requests for products or services, we will need to share some of the personally identifiable information you provided (like contact information and information about particular service needs) with service providers in the provider network. 

If you choose to receive promotions, newsletters, and/or other types of correspondence from us, the correspondence that you receive will originate from MyHuckleberry.com, Inc., or the provider network, and your personally identifiable information will continue to be solely maintained by MyHuckleberry.com, Inc.,

6\. Data Security 

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, digital certificates protect all of the customer transactional data we collect against unauthorized access.

Additionally, we use firewall security and limit data access to protect your personally identifiable information. 

We have put in place procedures to provide data security of our servers. We take precautions to protect your Personally Identifiable Information and other data from loss, misuse or alteration and to safeguard and secure the data You provide. While we strive to protect such information after it arrives at our servers, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that is being transmitted over the Internet. As a result, You provide such information at your own risk.
