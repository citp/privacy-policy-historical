# Web Privacy Policy

We, Logitech Europe S.A., explain in this Privacy Statement how we collect and use personal data from visitors of our web and mobile sites that link to this Privacy Statement (collectively “Sites”). This Privacy Statement does not apply to data we collect otherwise, such as offline or with products that we sell, unless we expressly declare in writing that this Privacy Statement shall also apply to such other data.

#### Actively Submitted Data

If you call us, send us an email or fill out a form on one of our Sites, you will know what information you provide because you will actively submit it to us. We use such information to respond to your request or otherwise communicate with you or assist you. We may collect data necessary to process your order if you make purchases through our Sites, such as your shipping address, products ordered, and contact information.

#### Passively Provided Data

We use tracking technology (including "cookies") on the Sites to customize and improve the Sites.
