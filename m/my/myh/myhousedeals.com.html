				While we use encryption to protect sensitive information 
				transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. 
				Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
				job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted 
				access to personally identifiable information. The 
				computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable 
				information are kept in a secure environment. <br>
