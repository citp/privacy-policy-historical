SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our websites from capturing and viewing your personal information.

We cannot promise that your use of our websites or mobile applications will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. Online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not share your password.

Our websites contain links to third party websites. If you click on one of those links, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This Privacy and Security Statement does not apply to the information practices of those websites. You should read the privacy policies of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for third party websites.

###  Our Tracking Techniques 

**Tracking Tools We Use  
**  
We collect personal and other information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information. These may include browser and flash cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies. We or third parties may also collect or receive information from our mobile applications and others’ applications and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads. We (and our third party service providers) also use these tools: 

  * To track new visitors to our websites. 
  * To recognize returning customers. 
  * To learn what site referred you to our website or mobile application.  

  * To store your password if you are registered on our website. 
  * To personalize your experience on our website, mobile application and on third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications.  

  * To collect and store geographic data determined by the IP address of your computer.  

  * To optimize and tailor our websites and mobile applications.  

  * To make product recommendations and provide you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested. As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on our mobile applications, our websites or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners and vendors.  

  * So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors and mobile application users, and their respective interests. 
  * To provide correct pricing and ads for the local store you select. 



###  Controlling Our Tracking Tools 

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/). Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. Your mobile device may not give you the ability to control cookies. If you wish to block cookies on our mobile applications, you will need to delete the application from your mobile device. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our websites. If you configure to block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. 

 **Our "Do Not Track" policy:** Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals. 

###  Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads 

We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads. This may include ads served on our websites or mobile applications. This may also include ads served on other companies' websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties. For example, information a third party collects when you register for a website, like your zip code. This might be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our websites or on third party websites.

To learn more about interest-based ads and to opt out of certain types of interest-based advertising, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

###  My Account Registration and Use 

My Account registration is an optional service provided by our website. You do not have to register to browse or shop online. When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and a username and password that you select. You may also optionally provide information regarding your interests and home improvement projects or register your credit cards. This information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information.
