myhosting.com will use all information collected from their Users for internal purposes only. myhosting.com does not sell or otherwise disclose to third parties any Personal Information that it has obtained. An exception is the information disclosed for the purpose of registering a domain name. Only contract information for a domain name will be provided to the registrar partner(s) in order to complete the registration process. Some anonymous data based on information collected from Users may be disclosed to potential and existing business partners, and investors.

Additionally, there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted or where myhosting.com is obliged to disclose information without consent pursuant to the requirements of Section 7(3) – Disclosure without knowledge or consent – of PIPEDA and Division 1 – Protection of Personal Information – of PIPEDA in which circumstances myhosting.com may be obligated to disclose information without consent.

Where obliged or permitted to disclose information without consent, myhosting.com will not disclose more information than is required.

Personal Information may also be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership of all or part of myhosting.com. This will occur only if the parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of such information is restricted to those purposes that relate to the business transaction, including a determination whether or not to proceed with the business transaction, and is to be used by the parties to carry out and complete the business transaction.

**Maintenance and Security of Personal Information**  
myhosting.com retains Personal Information about Users as long as myhosting.com believes it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. Currently, myhosting.com holds the Personal Information in the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 

Personal Information about Users that is maintained on our systems is protected using industry standard security measures and myhosting.com compiles with the security safeguards principal of Schedule 1, Clause 4.7 of PIPEDA. However, we cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure and transmission of information over the Internet is susceptible to possible loss, misrouting, interception and misuse.

**Access to Personal Information**  
myhosting.com provides individuals with access to Personal Information held about them and complies with the individual access principal of Schedule 1, Clause 4.9 of PIPEDA.

If an individual believes that their Personal Information on file is not correct, individuals can access the myhosting.com web-based Control Panel that allows individuals to view and update all of their Personal Information at any time. Pursuant to Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, individuals may also request an update of that information by sending a request to the email address indicated below. myhosting.com reserves the right not to change any Personal Information but will append any alternative text the individual concerned believes appropriate.

Pursuant to Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, an individual may also request that myhosting.com delete an individual’s Personal Information from myhosting.com’s system and records . However, due to technical constraints and the fact that myhosting.com backs up its systems, Personal Information may continue to reside in myhosting.com’s systems after deletion for some time. Individuals, therefore, should not expect that their Personal Information would be completely removed from myhosting.com’s systems in response to an accepted request for deletion.

myhosting.com reserves the right to decline access to Personal Information where disclosure of the information requested is not required, as per Division 1, Clause 9 of PIPEDA.

Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure, pursuant to the principal in Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.4 of PIPEDA. Where information will be disclosed, myhosting.com will endeavour to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and no later than thirty (30) days following the request. 

myhosting.com will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, myhosting.com will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.

To guard against fraudulent requests for access, myhosting.com will require sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections.

**Amendment of myhosting.com practices and this Policy**  
This statement is in effect as of January 1, 2004. myhosting.com will from time to time review and revise its privacy practices and this Policy. In the event of any amendment, an appropriate notice will be posted on this website.
