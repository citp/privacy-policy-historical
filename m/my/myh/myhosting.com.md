This includes name, address, email address and credit card information that you provide, and any correspondence that you have with myhosting.com that occurs by way of telephone, email, online chat, web-based email forms and/or support tickets that are generated for the purpose of communicating and/or resolving any issues related to the Services. myhosting.com also collects additional usage information (“Additional Usage Information”) that is collected electronically about how Users use our website (e.g. by tracking the number of unique page views received by the pages of the website, or the domains from which Users originate) or via cookies that can be used to identify the User should they visit the website again. 

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. 

We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. [Click here for more information](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=32050). 

We may set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Session cookies are used to store the contents of your shopping cart, should you choose to complete the check-out process later during your visit to myhosting.com.

In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information, but share only information such Order ID, total value of the shopping cart, and the website from which you linked to our websites.

This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the section Access and Consent.
