      <p>This Privacy Policy (the 
        “Policy”) governs all aspects of how myhosting.com 
        collects, uses, maintains and discloses personal information from all 
        users ("Users") of all Services (“Services”) offered 
        by myhosting.com. myhosting.com complies with the requirements of the 
        Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 
        (“PIPEDA”).</p>
      <p><b>myhosting.com values 
        the privacy of their customers.</b><br>
        The privacy of Users has been very important to myhosting.com since its 
        foundation in 1997. myhosting.com is committed to protecting the confidentially 
        of all information entrusted to it by Users. All content contained on

        Information from anyone under the age of 18.</p>
      <p><b>Information that myhosting.com 
        collects.</b><br>
        myhosting.com, from time-to-time, may collect personally identifiable 
        information (“<b>Personal Information</b>”) from Users. This 
        includes name, address, email address, date of birth, and credit card 
        information that you provide, and any correspondence that you have with 
        myhosting.com that occurs by way of email, web-based email forms and/or 
        support tickets that are generated for the purpose of communicating and/or 
        resolving any issues related to the Services. myhosting.com also collects 
        additional usage information (“<b>Additional Usage Information</b>”) 
        that is collected electronically about how Users use our website (e.g. 
        by tracking the number of unique pageviews received by the pages of the 
        website, or the domains from which Users originate) or via cookies that 
        can be used to identify the User should they visit the website again. 
        Additional Usage Information collected may include other information about 
        your visits to our website. For example, we may collect information about 
        your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer 
        whenever you surf the World Wide Web); the type of Internet browser you 
        are using; the type of computer operating system you are using; or the 
        domain name of the website from which you linked to our websites. This 
        Additional Usage Information will not be linked to your Personal Information 
        and will only be collected in the aggregate in connection with all the 
        users of our website for planning, forecasting and/or evaluation purposes. 
        As such, please note that this Policy does not cover aggregated data from 
        which the identity of an individual cannot be determined. myhosting.com 
        retains the right to use anonymous aggregated data in any way that it 
        determines appropriate.</p>
      <p><b>Your Consent</b><br>
        Your provision of Personal Information to myhosting.com means that 
        you agree and consent that myhosting.com may collect, use and disclose
          your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy. If you do
          not agree with these terms, you are requested not to provide any Personal
          Information to myhosting.com. myhosting.com services can only be offered
          if you provide Personal Information to myhosting.com. Consequently,
          if you choose not to provide us with any required Personal Information,
        myhosting.com will not be able to offer you certain services.</p>
      <p>If you do not wish to 
        receive information regarding the products and services offered by myhosting.com
        and its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners
        please: (i) send an e-mail to the address listed at the end of this policy;
        or (ii) log into web—based Control Panel and change the appropriate
        preferences so as to not receive any correspondence from myhosting.com
        for any products and services offered by myhosting.com, its trusted affiliates,
        independent contractors and business partners.</p>
      <p><b>How myhosting.com 
        uses Personal Information</b><br>
myhosting.com may, from time-to-time, use Personal Information collected through 
this website to: (i) provide Users with a product or service that has been 
requested; (ii) contact Users directly regarding products and services offered 
by myhosting.com and its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and 
business partners; (iii) understand User preferences in order to enhance Users' 
experience with myhosting.com and such affiliates, independent contractors and 
business partners; and (iv) research the effectiveness of the website and the 
marketing, advertising and sales efforts of myhosting.com, its trusted 
affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.</p>
<p>myhosting.com's use of 
Personal Information is limited to these purposes. Unless permitted by law, no 
Personal Information about a User is collected, without first obtaining the 
consent of the individual to the collection, use and dissemination of that 
information. </p>
      <p><b>Disclosure of Information</b><br>
        myhosting.com will use all information collected from their Users for 
        internal purposes only. myhosting.com does not sell or otherwise disclose 
        to third parties any Personal Information that it has obtained. An exception 
        is the information disclosed for the purpose of registering a domain name. 
        Only contract information for a domain name will be provided to the registrar 
        partner(s) in order to complete the registration process. Some anonymous 
        data based on information collected from Users may be disclosed to potential 
        and existing business partners, and investors.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there 
        are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information 
        may be justified or permitted or where myhosting.com is obliged to disclose 
        information without consent pursuant to the requirements of Section 7(3) 
        – Disclosure without knowledge or consent – of PIPEDA and 
        Division 1 – Protection of Personal Information – of PIPEDA 
        in which circumstances myhosting.com may be obligated to disclose information 
        without consent.</p>
      <p>Where obliged or 
        permitted to disclose information without consent, myhosting.com will 
        not disclose more information than is required.</p>
      <p>Personal Information 
        may also be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change 
        of ownership of all or part of myhosting.com. This will occur only if 
        the parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, 
        use and disclosure of such information is restricted to those purposes 
        that relate to the business transaction, including a determination whether 
        or not to proceed with the business transaction, and is to be used by 
        the parties to carry out and complete the business transaction.</p>
      <p><b>Maintenance and 
        Security of Personal Information</b><br>
        myhosting.com retains Personal Information about Users as long as myhosting.com 
        believes it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. 
        Currently, myhosting.com holds the Personal Information in the City of 
        Toronto, Ontario, Canada. </p>
      <p>Personal Information 
        about Users that is maintained on our systems is protected using industry 
        standard security measures and myhosting.com compiles with the security 
        safeguards principal of Schedule 1, Clause 4.7 of PIPEDA. However, we 
        cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or 
        transmitted from our systems will be completely secure and transmission 
        of information over the Internet is susceptible to possible loss, misrouting, 
        interception and misuse. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Access to Personal 
        Information</b><br>
        myhosting.com provides individuals with access to Personal Information 
        held about them and complies with the individual access principal of Schedule 
        1, Clause 4.9 of PIPEDA.</p>
      <p>If an individual believes 
        that their Personal Information on file is not correct, individuals can 
        access the myhosting.com web-based Control Panel that allows individuals 
        to view and update all of their Personal Information at any time. Pursuant 
        to Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, individuals may also request an 
        update of that information by sending a request to the email address indicated 
        below. myhosting.com reserves the right not to change any Personal Information 
        but will append any alternative text the individual concerned believes 
        appropriate.</p>
      <p>Pursuant to Schedule 
        1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, an individual may also request that myhosting.com 
        delete an individual’s Personal Information from myhosting.com’s 
        system and records . However, due to technical constraints and the fact 
        that myhosting.com backs up its systems, Personal Information may continue 
        to reside in myhosting.com’s systems after deletion for some time. 
        Individuals, therefore, should not expect that their Personal Information 
        would be completely removed from myhosting.com’s systems in response 
        to an accepted request for deletion.</p>
      <p>myhosting.com reserves 
        the right to decline access to Personal Information where disclosure of 
        the information requested is not required, as per Division 1, Clause 9 
        of PIPEDA.</p>
      <p>Where information will not 
        or cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will be provided 
        with the reasons for non-disclosure, pursuant to the principal in Schedule 
        1, Clause 4.9.4 of PIPEDA. Where information will be disclosed, myhosting.com 
        will endeavour to provide the information in question within a reasonable 
        time and no later than thirty (30) days following the request. </p>
      <p>myhosting.com will not respond 
        to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether 
        a request is repetitious or vexatious, myhosting.com will consider such 
        factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose 
        for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.</p>
      <p>To guard against fraudulent 
        requests for access, myhosting.com will require sufficient information 
        to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before 
        granting access or making corrections.</p>
      <p><b>Amendment of myhosting.com 
        practices and this Policy</b><br>
        This statement is in effect as of January 1, 2004. myhosting.com will 
        from time to time review and revise its privacy practices and this Policy. 
        In the event of any amendment, an appropriate notice will be posted on 
        this website. Policy changes will apply to the information collected from 
        the date of posting of the revised Policy to myhosting.com’s website 
        as well as to existing information held by myhosting.com.</p>
      <p><b>Questions</b><br>
        If you have any questions about the privacy practices of myhosting.com, 
        or you wish to access your Personal Information, please contact:</p>
