# Privacy Policy • My Online Training Hub

**Introduction**

My Online Training Hub regards customer privacy as an important part of our relationship with our customers. The following privacy policy applies to all My Online Training Hub users, and conforms to Internet privacy standards.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first [contact us](http://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/contact-us)

My Online Training Hub only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our email communications or have purchased one of our products.

**Collection of Information**

My Online Training Hub collects personally identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address, postal address, and credit card information when purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.

All correspondence may also be collected and stored, particularly in regard to sales, support and accounts, including email.

**Use of Collection Information**

This information is used for internal marketing purposes only. My Online Training Hub does not sell, exchange, or release your personal information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit data, etc.) Your information is not shared with any other third party or company outside of billing and shipping purposes.

Any details collected from My Online Training Hub customers are required in order to provide you with our products and/or services, and a high level of customer service.

All of the newsletters that are sent to you by My Online Training Hub include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from our newsletters by clicking on the unsubscribe link. You can also [contact us](http://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/contact-us) to change your information at any time.

**What are cookies/clear GIFs and how do we use them?**

Cookies: Like many other commercial sites, our Site utilizes standard technologies called “cookies” and clear GIFs to collect information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or capture any of the Personally Identifiable information.

Clear GIFs: At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information and only track the visitor traffic and behaviour to and on our Site.

Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company’s clear GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behaviour for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners, but that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit and never includes personally identifiable information.

**Storage of Collected Information**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you login to our site you can do so using HTTPS (SSL) encryption on the login page.

This site does not store any credit card details. Payment processing is carried out by our payment partners, [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/au/webapps/mpp/merchant-solution) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca).

If you enter your credit card details to purchase one of our products, you will be entering that information directly to either Paypal or Stripe. 

Both Paypal and Stripe are PCI DSS compliant which means they have been certified as having the necessary systems to handle and store your sensitive financial information as securely as possible.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

If you have any questions about security on our Website, please [contact us](http://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/contact-us)

**Third Parties**

My Online Training Hub may at its discretion use other third parties to provide essential services on our site or for our business processes. We may share your details as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
