## MYOB Group Privacy Policy

### We value your privacy

Protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential is very important to us. We're bound by the Privacy Act 1988, including the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in the Act, when we handle your personal information.

This MYOB Group Privacy Policy (Policy) outlines how we maintain your privacy when handling your personal information if you're a client, a visitor to one of our websites or a member of the public, in Australia.

If you work for us, you can contact our human resources team for more information about how your privacy is handled internally. If you’re applying for a job online with us, you can view the [MYOB Employment Relations Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/au/privacy-policy/employee-relations-privacy-statement). If you're based in New Zealand, please see our [MYOB Group Privacy Policy for New Zealand](https://web.archive.org/nz/privacy-policy)

In this Policy, we use the terms, "we", "us", "our" or "MYOB" to refer to MYOB Australia Pty Ltd and its related companies.

Personal information means information or an opinion that identifies you, or could reasonably identify you as an individual, whether the information or opinion is true or not.

  2. The kinds of personal information we may collect from you

2.1 We only collect personal information from you that is necessary to do business with you.

2.2 The personal information that we collect about you includes your name, postal and street address, email address, telephone number, gender, age, profession/role, place of work, information relating to the complaints you've made to us and various personal preferences. We also collect your payment information, such as your credit card or direct debit information and ABN, when you purchase a product or service from us. If you're a bank feeds user, we'll collect your account details so that you and your other authorised recipients can receive transaction information from your nominated accounts.

2.3 Some personal information is considered 'sensitive information' under the Privacy Act. Sensitive information can include your membership of a professional or trade association (e.g. CPA status), which we might collect from you in certain situations. We'll only collect sensitive information about you if you give the information to us yourself, or otherwise consent to us having it.

    1. We may provide your personal information to our related companies and to third party service providers that we outsource functions to or partner with, in certain limited situations where it’s necessary for us to do so in order to provide our products and services or perform associated business activities.
    2. These third parties assist us by performing functions such as client contact, archiving, auditing, professional advisory, banking, data processing, marketing and advertising, data analysis, business intelligence, website and technology services. They may also provide products and services that integrate with or complement our solutions. For some of our products and services, we partner with government tax departments to file tax information on your behalf.
    3. Each of the third parties that we contract with is carefully selected and is only authorised to use your personal information in a secure way that’s necessary for them to perform their service to us.
    4. Some of our related companies and third parties that we share information with may be located outside of Australia, in the United States, Singapore, India, the Philippines, New Zealand and other countries.
    5. We'll also disclose your personal information if we are required by law or permitted by the Privacy Act to do so.  

4.3 Aggregated data

    1. Aggregated data is general data about groups of people which doesn’t personally identify you or anyone else, for example – the number of people that use a product in a particular industry. We use aggregated data to:
      1. help us to understand how you use our products and services and improve your customer experience;
      2. tailor the way that we communicate with you about our products and services so that we can interact with you more effectively; and
      3. create helpful insights for the business community.
    2. We sometimes share aggregated data with our business or industry partners.

  5. Holding your personal information and keeping it safe

5.1 We typically hold the personal information that we collect either on electronic databases or as hard copy documents.

5.2 The security of your personal information is fundamental to the way that we do business. We take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information that you give us from unauthorised access, use or disclosure, in line with industry standards.

5.3 We do this by employing a range of security measures to protect the personal information that we hold. For example our web pages that request sensitive information may employ encryption technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

5.4 You can confirm that a data-entry page uses encryption by checking that:

    1. the page address in the web browser's tool bar or status bar begins with https://; or
    2. the padlock icon in the web browser's tool bar or status bar is locked.

5.5 If you're a registered user of any of our websites, you can control access to your account with a username and password of your choice. You should choose a strong password and keep it protected from others to prevent unauthorised access.

5.6 We're also committed to protecting your information offline. All of your personal and business information, not just personal information and sensitive information, is subject to access controls.

5.7 Whilst we take all reasonable measures to protect your personal information when it’s in our hands, it’s important to note that we’re unable to guarantee the security of the internet as a whole. If you’re using your product and service online, please ensure that you’re doing so in a secure environment. In addition, if you use email to send and receive your personal information, please be aware that the information may be less secure in transit.

  6. Our product promotion and how to opt out of direct marketing

    2. If you don't want us to use your personal information for marketing purposes, you can let us know at any time through one of the following channels:
      1. to opt out of email marketing:
        * login to my.MYOB and update your communication preferences; or
        * click the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any of our marketing communications.
      2. if you don’t have a my.MYOB login or if you’re responding to a marketing communication that you’ve received via a different channel (such as direct mail or phone calls), please send an email to unsubscribe_email@myob.com.au with “unsubscribe” in the subject line.

We use cookies to track your onsite behaviour to ensure transaction pages, such as "shopping cart" interactions and support pages, work correctly. We also use cookies to personalise and improve your experience with us. Most cookies don't collect personal information and only contain coded information that can't be used by third parties to access your confidential information. Most web browsers allow you to adjust settings to erase cookies, disallow cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is set. Please note that some parts of our websites may not function fully if you disallow cookies.
    2. In some cases we or third parties may use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons and JavaScript on our websites in connection with online services like banner advertising, website analytics and surveys. These technologies enable information to be collected about your use of our websites (including your computer’s IP address), which may be stored in the United States, Singapore, New Zealand or other countries. The information collected by these technologies give us and third party collectors the ability to deliver customised advertising content, measure advertising effectiveness, evaluate the use of our websites and other websites and provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage. We and third parties may also transfer collected information to others if required by law, or where those other parties process the information on our behalf.
