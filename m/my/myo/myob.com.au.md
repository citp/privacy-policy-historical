##  MYOB Group Privacy Policy 

####  MYOB values your privacy

Protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential is important to MYOB.

This MYOB Group Privacy Policy outlines the policy of MYOB Australia Pty Ltd and its related companies, including Media Transfer Services Limited, the provider of the MYOB BankLink service, for maintaining your privacy and handling your personal information.

This MYOB Group Privacy Policy relates to personal information we handle about our clients, visitors to our websites and other members of the public. If you work for MYOB, you can contact our human resources team for more information about how your privacy is handled internally. If you’re applying for a job online with us, you can view the MYOB Employment Relations Privacy Statement on our [careers web page](http://fsr.cvmail.com.au/MYOB/privacy.cfm).

In this MYOB Group Privacy Policy, we use the terms, " **we** ", " **us** ", " **our** " or " **MYOB** " to refer to MYOB Australia Pty Ltd and its related companies, including Media Transfer Services Limited. We use the term, " **MYOB BankLink** " to specifically refer to Media Transfer Services Limited.

**1.             ****What is personal information?**

1.1.    Personal information means information or an opinion that identifies you, or could reasonably identify you as an individual, whether the information or opinion is true or not.

1.2     Some personal information is considered 'sensitive information' under the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)_ ( **Privacy Act** ).  Sensitive information can include your membership of a professional or trade association.

**2.         ****Collecting and holding personal information**

2.1     We collect personal information which is necessary to do business with you.

2.2     The personal information that we collect about you includes your name, postal and street address, email address, telephone number, gender, age, profession/role, place of work, information relating to the complaints you have made to us and various personal preferences. We also collect your payment information, such as your credit card or direct debit information and ABN, when you purchase a product or service from us.

2.3     MYOB BankLink electronically collects read-only feeds of transactions from your bank or financial institution, as those transactions appear on your account statement. This information can be passed on to your nominated accountant or professional adviser, and can be synced with certain MYOB online products. This service is known as “ **bank feeds** ”. You can consent to receiving bank feeds by executing a hard copy authority form or through online registration. We then give that consent to your bank or financial institution. Once the bank or financial institution has processed your consent, we can start providing you and your other designated users with bank feeds in respect of your nominated accounts.

2.4     In certain circumstances we may collect sensitive information about you such as your membership of a professional association (e.g. CPA status). The Privacy Act regulates the collection and handling of sensitive information. We are able to collect that information if you voluntarily give it to us or if you otherwise consent to us collecting it. We will only collect sensitive information about you from you. If you provide us with sensitive information, this will constitute your consent.

5.1     Our websites contain many useful services, and we’re constantly making changes and improvements to provide you with an even better website experience and to help make your business life easier.

5.2     Your personal information gives you authorised access to our websites so that you can update your personal information, access online help or perform financial transactions. For some products, you may be able to authorise other people (such as your employees, accountant or bookkeeper) to access, add and manage information on your behalf.

5.3     Our websites may contain links to third party websites. These websites do not belong to us and are beyond our control. Please note that we are not responsible for and cannot guarantee the privacy of websites that do not belong to us.

5.4     We use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to analyse trends, administer our websites, track your navigation among MYOB web pages and gather broad information for aggregate use. Our web servers may also send a small data file known as a "cookie" to your internet browser or hard drive. We use cookies to track your onsite behaviour to ensure transaction pages, such as "shopping cart" interactions and support pages, work correctly. We also use cookies to personalise and improve your MYOB client experience. Most cookies do not collect personal information and only contain coded information that cannot be used by third parties to access your confidential information. Most web browsers allow you to adjust settings to erase cookies, disallow cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is set. Please note that some parts of our websites may not function fully if you disallow cookies.

5.5     In some cases we or third parties may use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons and JavaScript on our websites in connection with online services like banner advertising, website analytics and surveys. These technologies enable information to be collected about your use of our websites (including your computer’s IP address), which may be stored in the United States, Singapore, New Zealand or other countries. The information collected by these technologies give us and third party collectors the ability to deliver customised advertising content, measure advertising effectiveness, evaluate the use of MYOB websites and other websites and provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage. We and third parties may also transfer collected information to others if required by law, or where those other parties process the information on our behalf. The services we may use from time to time include Google Analytics, Google AdSense, DoubleClick, Yahoo, Adobe, Bing, Kenshoo and Microsoft.

**6.             Security of personal information**

6.1     We have a range of security measures in place to protect the personal information that we hold. For example, those of our web pages that request sensitive information may employ encryption technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

6.2     You can confirm that a data-entry page uses encryption by checking that:

(a)    the page address in the web browser's tool bar or status bar begins with https://; or

(b)    the padlock icon in the web browser's tool bar or status bar is locked.

6.3     If you are considering sending us any personal information by standard email, please be aware that the information may be less secure in transit. We are required by law to take steps to protect the security of personal information once it comes into our possession.

6.4     If you are a registered user of any MYOB website, you can control access to your account with a username and password of your choice. You should choose a strong password and keep it protected from others to prevent unauthorised access.

6.5     We are also committed to protecting your information offline. All of your personal and business information, not just personal information and sensitive information, is subject to access controls.

6.6     The security measures that we put in place to protect your information and to deliver the bank feeds service through MYOB BankLink are audited by the banks and financial institutions to ensure compliance with security standards. Access is only authorised for bank feeds if those security standards are met. MYOB BankLink will never ask you for your internet login, PIN or passwords.

7.1     Subject to any exceptions in the Privacy Act, if you have provided us with personal information, you have a right to request to access or correct it. If you want to access or correct your personal information you should contact us using the contact details at the bottom of this web page.

7.2     Once you have made your request for access or correction, we will respond within a reasonable period. In some cases we may ask you to pay an administrative fee to cover costs associated with your request for access.

7.3     We will provide you with a copy of or details of your personal information wherever it is possible and practicable to do so. Otherwise, we will work with you to find a mutually agreed alternative.

7.4     If after exploring all options, we refuse to correct or give you access to your personal information, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons for the refusal (except where it would be unreasonable to do so), the mechanisms available to you to complain about the refusal and any other matters that the Privacy Act requires us to address.
