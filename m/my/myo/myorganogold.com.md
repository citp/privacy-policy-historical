### Overview

By accepting this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the OG website user agreement. Personal information is information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you and it also includes anonymous information that is linked to information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you.

### How We May Collect or Receive Information from You

OG may collect or receive your personal data from you through your use of the Website in various ways. You may choose to submit your personal data and other information to us through various communication channels provided on the “Contact Us” webpage of the Website, for example, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers or online forms. You may browse the OG website without revealing any personal information about yourself, however once you wish to actually use the features available on the OG website, you will not be able to retain your anonymity. In order to fully meet your needs and provide you with an efficient and enjoyable experience, as well as providing access to certain features that may be of interest to you, we may require personal information. This may include things such as your full name, postal address, phone number, email address, billing information, shipping information, financial information (debit or credit card numbers and other card information) or demographic information (information that you submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor financial information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, username, age, birth date, purchase history information, browsing history information, searching history information, registration history information, and the content of communications between you and other users over the OG website. Demographic information is either “non-public information”, which consists of user history information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the OG website, or “public information”, which consists of all other demographic information. We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into a publicly viewed area (for example, don’t use your address or password as your username, or include your name or address in written communications or item descriptions), because if you do then it will then become “public information.” You always have the option to not provide specific information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you visit the OG website, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the OG website for you and to diagnose problems with the OG website, we use your IP address only to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.

If you choose to post messages in our Forum, chat rooms, message areas (this may include, but is not limited to Twitter, Facebook and similar) or leave feedback for other users, we will collect that information you have provided. This information will be reviewed by us as necessary to provide customer support, diagnose technical problems, and resolve disputes.

A specific file may be retained for you regarding any direct correspondence to us, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site.

Your buying, selling, and browsing habits on the OG website are automatically tracked for the purpose of our own research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior in order to better understand, protect and serve you and our online community. This may include the site that you just came from, the one that you will visit next, your computer browser information, and your IP address.

As a global company, OG has a number of corporate affiliates in different jurisdictions. Each of these affiliates collects, processes and determines how to process your personal information to help providing you with the services you request.

In order to operate the OG website, including processing your transactions and supporting your activities, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our internal agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, billing, affiliate programmes, email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, order fulfilment and promotional fulfilment. We require these entities by confidentiality agreement, not to use your information for any other purpose without your expressed permission.

You should evaluate any third party’s privacy practices before using their services. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.

In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages of the OG website. These pages are known as “Co-Branded Pages” and these companies are known as “Co-Branded Companies.” If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share some of your e-mail information with the associated Co-Branded Company.

OG will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties in the interest of enforcing laws, preventing criminal activity, protecting rights (including intellectual property), and protecting you and our OG community from harmful or criminal acts. Therefore, if we receive a verified request by government officials or other law enforcement agencies regarding an alleged illegal activity or investigation, you authorize us to disclose any of your personal information or history without a subpoena.

Users must have an opportunity to have you remove any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, you can disclose personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that user. You agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you regarding OG related matters. Note that law enforcement personnel, and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access.

Regardless of whom it is you are communicating with — be it a purchaser, fellow Distributor, or even the Company itself — AND, regardless where the message originates from — be it from another Distributor, your business organization, or even the Company itself — ABSOLUTELY NO MESSAGES SENT BY to you or your e-mail address should include any reference, or insinuation of approbation of the communication by the Company.

The Company has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy regarding any act which violates the above Policy. Be forewarned, if the above provision is not observed, then OG will take appropriate legal action.
