**General**

_Garden Fresh Co-op_ thinks your privacy is important. Please read this section of our website to learn more about Garden Fresh Co-op's philosophy and privacy policy. We understand that the protection of privacy is a major concern to many of our customers. Garden Fresh Co-op is working hard to gain your trust by selling only the highest quality foods and products, and we want to do everything reasonably possible to keep your trust. To build on our relationship, Garden Fresh Co-op wants you to understand a little bit about how our website interacts with visitors and how we will use any information gathered when you visit our website. By using our services and viewing this Site, you are consenting to the information collection, use and disclosure practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Types of Information Gathered**

Garden Fresh Co-op may gather the following types of information: (1) personal information given voluntarily while using a feature of this website, for example, during a registration process or purchase, including name, address, phone number, e-mail address, birth date; financial information, such as credit card number; (2) information gathered as a result of voluntary participation in a survey or poll, or when communicating with our webmaster or customer service Team Members; and (3) information gathered automatically when visitors visit our website.

Garden Fresh Co-op will not sell or otherwise share personally identifying information with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide services to you at your request, or as required by law. Garden Fresh Co-op will share this information with certain business partners to provide requested service that we do not provide directly. Garden Fresh Co-op will only share personally identifying information with these business partners if they agree not to disclose the information to other parties and agree not to use this information to solicit. 

Garden Fresh Co-op may share aggregate data collected through its website that does not personally identify any party with our research partner, and may from time to time share this type data with other business partners.

Garden Fresh Co-op may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

Also, if you participate in any blog or other online forum on our Site, any personal information that you post on the website may be shared with other participants in the forum. In any of these situations, the recipient of the personal information may be located in the United States or another jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home country. 

**Registration**

In order for you to receive specific benefits of our website you may first be asked to supply certain information such as your zip code. Garden Fresh Co-op wants to supply you with information that benefits you and the more relevant information we have about you the better we are able to do this. 

Garden Fresh Co-op currently has an electronic newsletter and may launch similar products in the future. If you choose to receive our electronic newsletter, you will be asked for certain information so that we can customize your newsletter to suit your needs. Upon registering for the electronic newsletter, you will be asked for your name, email address, zip code, and other information specified in the enrollment process. You may be asked to tell us a little about your interests, including but not limited to, what sorts of articles you like to read, the sorts of wellness choices you currently make, and other questions of this nature. This information is used to deliver you a personalized electronic newsletter that we believe will be of interest to you. The more of this information you choose to share with us, the better we can craft a newsletter specifically for you. 

If you choose not to share information with us the newsletter will simply be more generic. For example, if you are primarily interested in articles about the environment, we can't deliver those to you unless you share your interest with us. Similarly, if you are a vegetarian and request recipes without disclosing this fact, we can't guarantee that all recipes we send you will be meat-free. Providing us with this type of information is voluntary and you may change supplied information or unsubscribe at any time from any portion or all of Garden Fresh Co-op's online services.

From time to time, Garden Fresh Co-op website users may be asked to participate in voluntary surveys and polls.
