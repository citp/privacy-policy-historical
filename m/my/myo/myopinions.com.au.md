SSI serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information (“ **PII** ”) and other information by SSI in connection with SSI’s Services (as defined herein). SSI’s Services provide you with the opportunity to join a panel, participate in surveys administered by SSI or by third parties (whether as a panel member or a non-panel member), use the websites associated with the panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively “ **Services** ”). Surveys administered by third parties and the data collected in connection therewith are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Registration with, use of, and access to SSI’s Services is subject to [SSI’s Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/policies/terms/general).  Your use of SSI’s Services is completely voluntary and therefore SSI’s processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. SSI strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, CASRO and ESOMAR. For clarification, except for panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of SSI’s survey research panels. In most cases SSI is not the sponsor of the survey and that the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data, are and will be owned by the sponsor of the survey.  All references in this Privacy Policy to “SSI” include SSI and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to “us” or “we” refer to SSI. 

All PII is stored on servers located in the United States, where SSI’s servers are located.

## Re-Targeting

SSI may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an SSI website(s) or to manage SSI’s advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). SSI’s third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements to gather information about your activities on SSI’s website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about SSI and its services and/or (ii) assist SSI in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile.

## SSI’s Online Ad Effectiveness Program.

In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that SSI is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, SSI’s clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a “ **Third Party Technology** ” and collectively the “ **Third Party Technologies** ”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, SSI’s servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and SSI’s client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, SSI’s client will send your UID and the specific survey to SSI and SSI will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, SSI may share your UID and data previously collected by SSI, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (“ **Audience Measurement Data** ”), to third parties, including, without limitation, SSI’s subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on.

Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).
