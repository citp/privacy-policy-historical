_Log Files_ . The Application/Services may automatically gather and store certain information, including, without limitation, data available from your web browser, including, without limitation, IP Address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exiting pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data in log files.

_Digital Fingerprinting_. Generally, digital fingerprinting assigns a unique identifier to your device based upon the device's technical settings, characteristics, and IP Address. SSI uses digital fingerprinting technology for quality control and validation purposes and fraud detection and/or prevention, including, without limitation, identifying duplicate or fraudulent respondents. SSI may implement and use digital fingerprinting directly or through a third party vendor with your consent where required by applicable law.

_Watermarking_. Generally, watermarking involves placing a technology or file on your device to identify that it has previously been used to register with or access the Application/Services or the Services. Watermarking is used for quality control and validation purposes and fraud detection and/or prevention purposes. SSI may engage in watermarking activities directly or through a third party vendor with your consent where required by applicable law.

In some cases, we may use information collected through automated means, along with other information, to recognize users (or households) across platforms or across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

_Information collected from third parties_

SSI may obtain PII, behavioral and/or demographic information from third parties, including, without limitation, data management platforms, ad networks, information service bureaus, other sample suppliers and/or social media platforms.  SSI may use the PII, behavioral and/or demographic data received from these third parties for various purposes, including, without limitation, data validation, data append, developing marketing insights, fraud detection purposes, and/or sending you a one-time email to invite you to participate in a survey and/or join a Panel.  In addition, geolocation data, including information regarding retail and other commercial enterprises you may visit while the geolocation feature is enabled, may be appended to your panel profile and/or shared with SSI’s clients if you elected to opt in to the geolocation services.     

**How does SSI use the information it collects?**

_SSI's use of information_ :

In addition to the purposes described above, SSI uses personal data collected through the Application/Services as follows: (i) to communicate with you regarding your membership with a survey panel(s) owned by SSI; (ii) to communicate with you regarding your participation in a survey(s); (iii) to tailor survey opportunities to you and to arrange for advertisements to be displayed to you outside the Application/Services for the purposes of facilitating the completion of advertisement recall surveys; (iv) to send you notifications of survey opportunities; (v) to comply with any and all legal obligations, including, without limitation, tax obligations; (vi) to administer and manage SSI's reward and incentive programs and fulfill your requests for rewards and incentives; (vii) to facilitate your entry into SSI's sweepstakes and promotions and communicate with you regarding such entries; (viii) to update SSI's records; (ix) to comply with any data suppression obligations or requirements; (x) for fraud detection and/or prevention purposes; (xi) to link your device and/or profile to additional information available about you and/or your device available from data management platforms (“DMP”); (xii) to market SSI products/services to you; (xiii) to enable third parties to market their products/services to you; (xiv) to enable SSI or third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models; (xv) to validate the profile information you provided to us; and/or (xvi) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Policy or as otherwise authorized by you.  SSI may use information collected in the context of the Application/Services in connection with other survey panels that SSI administers and/or in connection with Non-Research Activities.  With respect to the linking of Application/Services data to third party DMP data, SSI uses such data itself and/or permits SSI’s clients and/or the DMP itself to use such data to provide you with survey opportunities, to measure advertising effectiveness (as described in more detail below), to segment audiences; to design advertising campaigns using “look alike” cohort groups based on survey and third party data; and/or to market such third party’s products/services to you. 

_Retargeting_.  SSI may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an SSI website(s) or to manage SSI’s advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). SSI’s third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements. Including but not limited to your IDFA or Advertising ID to gather information about your activities on SSI’s website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about SSI and its services and/or (ii) assist SSI in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile. If SSI is conducting a re-targeting program and you wish to not participate in this re-targeting program, please opt-out via the applicable cookie opt-out process set forth in this Privacy Policy or in SSI’s separate cookie notice, by modifying your IDFA or Advertising ID and/or by unsubscribing within the advertisement itself.

_Audience Insights/Look-alikes_.  SSI and/or third parties may use PII collected from you and/or may link PII collected from you to a third party cookie to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns. 

_Online Advertising Effectiveness_.  In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding ads, promotions, content, campaigns, and/or websites that SSI is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, SSI’s clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a “ ** _Third Party Technology_** ” and collectively the “ ** _Third Party Technologies_** ”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, SSI’s servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and SSI’s client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, SSI’s client will send your UID and the specific survey to SSI and SSI will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.

_Audience Measurement Data_. In addition to the use and sharing of Audience Measurement Data (as defined below) in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, as such research is described above, SSI may share your UID and data previously collected by SSI, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (“ ** _Audience Measurement Data_** ”), to third parties, including, without limitation, SSI’s subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the content, advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, and to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).

**How do advertisers/ad networks use my information?**

_Ad partners' use of information_.

You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that SSI is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-SSI mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which SSI shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, SSI has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the " _Information collected through automated means_ " section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that SSI is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform SSI that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows SSI to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes. To learn more about some of these ad companies, including how to opt out, please visit the following:

**What communications will I receive through the Application/Services or relating to the Services?**

SSI may contact you to participate in surveys via "push" notifications or SMS/text messages if you expressly agree to receive such communications.

In addition, SSI and/or its agents or vendors on behalf of SSI will send email communications to you regarding survey invitations, survey participation, reward or incentive information, inquiries and redemption, newsletters, notices required to be provided hereunder or by law, sweepstakes or promotion entries, notice of winning a sweepstakes or promotion, and in response to inquiries from you.

(i) With your consent;

(vi) To authorized agents and/or subcontractors of SSI and/or of SSI's clients, who are providing services, including, without limitation, data append services, data validation services, fraud detection and/or prevention services, database matching services, coding services, and reward, incentive, and sweepstakes related services;

(vii) To a client for limited market research related uses including, without limitation, modeling, validation, data append, database segmentation, and reward, incentive, or sweepstakes redemption, fulfillment, and/or entry;

(viii) In connection with a change of ownership or control, including, without limitation, a merger or an acquisition of any or all of SSI's business assets, provided that the party receiving or acquiring the personal data agrees to use, protect, and maintain the security, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data in accordance with this Policy;

(ix) to a client or to such client’s customer in the event SSI or a third party believes that you have or may violate the intellectual property rights of a third party;

(x) to a client or to such client’s customer in the event SSI or a third party believes that you have violated the Terms of Service;

(xi) to a third party, which shall include both SSI research clients and third parties that engage in Non-Research Activities to enable such third party to develop marketing campaigns, audience insights, look-alike models and/or to market such third party’s products/services to you; and

(xi) As otherwise permitted pursuant to this Policy.

Please note, SSI may allow a client to collect PII directly from respondents. The disclosure is voluntary and, prior to collection, the client is required to enter into a written agreement with SSI, which, among other things, limits use of the PII. 

SSI may license certain PII to third parties (e.g., data brokers, data aggregators, etc.) for their own Non-Research Purposes, including, without limitation, the licensing of individual-level and/or aggregated-level data (e.g., product and/or service purchasing or usage activity, social media activity, website visitation data, internet search history, etc.) for the development of audience insights and/or look-alike models, for the purpose of sale of such data to the third party’s clients/customers for the purpose of performing analytics and providing marketing intelligence and/or to enable such third party to market its products/services to you.

Additionally, UIDs and information collected by automated means are provided to third parties, including, without limitation, clients, partners, agents and/or vendor for the purposes of identifying respondents for re-contact surveys or communications, fraud detection and/or prevention, database matching, data validation, data append, coding, data segmentation, and reward, incentive, and/or sweepstakes or promotion related services.

In connection with your survey data, SSI or the client may associate certain demographic attributes to you.  SSI may share with third parties, including but not limited to clients, the geographic and/or demographic data SSI collects from you during enrolment or through certain profile questions SSI may ask you. Such data may be shared with third parties on an individual respondent level or aggregate summary form (i.e. a group of respondents). If you voluntarily disclose personal data in connection with your survey data and responses, and SSI collects the survey data and responses, SSI will transfer the survey data and responses, UID and the voluntarily disclosed personal data to the relevant SSI client.

**How can I opt-out of certain data collection and/or use?**
