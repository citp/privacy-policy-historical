### WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY

The personal information that We collect about you broadly falls into the categories set out below.  
What do We do with the information We collect? The short answer is that We provide you with access to an amazing and personalized set of products and services that We are always seeking to improve upon.

  


### • Information that you provide

Certain parts of the Platform may ask you to provide personal information such as your name, email address, student status, and sometimes your student ID. For example, We ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with Us, to receive messages from Us (or [Our partners](https://www.myunidays.com/list/all/AtoZ)), to get information about products, services and promotional offers, competitions, sweepstakes, polls and surveys, experiences and opportunities, and/or to submit enquiries to Us (e.g. by interacting with Our Customer Service team). You may provide information about your preferences, values, and beliefs when completing surveys, or entering competitions.  
We will use the personal information that you provide to verify your identity, send relevant opportunities and information to you, improve Our services, restrict age-appropriate products and services, and to help Our partners send relevant information about their programmes, offers, products, and services.  
See ‘Information We obtain from Third Party Sources’ below to learn about internet-based advertising solutions.

  


### • Information that We collect automatically

When you visit the Platform, We collect information automatically from your device.  
The information We collect automatically includes information like your IP address, device type and software characteristics, unique device identification information, browser type, geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location), GPS (if enabled) and other technical information. We also collect information about how you and your device interact with the Platform, including pages you access and links you click, your purchase behaviour, engagement and interactions with perks, offers, features, polls, surveys and other content. Through Our App, We may find out your location; remember that you can turn this feature off through your device’s settings. If you choose to receive push notifications when downloading or updating App preferences, you will receive content in that way.  
Collecting this information enables Us to verify your identity, provide Our services to you and Our partners, and to get paid. The information We collect positions Us to better prevent fraud and enforce Our rights, your rights and third party rights. It also helps Us to understand the users of the Platform, such as where they come from and what content is of interest to them. We use this information for analytics purposes, to improve the quality of Our service and Platform, and to target and display content and services that are specifically suited to you. We may also use it to target different competitions and surveys based on detail, like which university you attend.  
Some information is collected via the use of cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies. See Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.myunidays.com/cookie-policy) for more information on how and why We use cookies and similar technologies.

  


### • Information that We obtain from Third Party sources

From time to time, We may receive personal information about you from partners, suppliers and third party sources (including social media service providers, cookies and pixels). This information includes your online interaction, and is used to provide services, and identify you as a member or a prospective customer of a partner, to monitor and analyse trends and usage, to learn more about Our members, to be as relevant as We can, to improve the quality of Our services and to tailor your experience and recommend products and services that We think you’ll be interested in. We will ask that these third parties are permitted or required to disclose your personal information to Us.  
More details are set out in Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.myunidays.com/cookie-policy).  
We may use third party data sources to enhance the information We hold about you, only where these third parties are permitted or required to disclose your personal information to Us. We help Our partners display interest-based advertising using information you make available to Us when you interact with Our sites, content, or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalised or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing through Our Platform, use of devices, apps or software, visiting sites that contain UNiDAYS or partner content or ads or cookies, or interacting with Our tools. We offer you choices about receiving interest-based ads from Us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from Us by opting out on the Platform or [here](https://www.myunidays.com/account/settings/notifications). You will still see ads, but they will not be personalised, and therefore may not be relevant to you.

### LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which We collect and use it.  
We will collect personal information from you for the following lawful basis: where We have your **consent** to do so, where We need the personal information to perform a **contract** with you, or where the processing is in the **legitimate interests** of Us, you or third party and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, We may also have a **legal obligation** to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your **vital interests** or those of another person.  
If We ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, We may not be able to enter into or perform the contract or comply with Our legal obligations if you do not provide that information. An example of this is when We ask you to provide Us with your university email address as We can’t verify that you’re a student without it. We need the information to provide the service.  
Similarly, if We collect and use your personal information in reliance on **legitimate interests** (or Us, you or third party), We will do so in the interests of providing direct marketing, to prevent and detect fraud, for organisational reasons, to improve Our services, for network and information security purposes, to ensure We comply with the law and comply with your individual rights, to ensure We suppress any requests you make, to provide personalised messages, to retain evidence of Our compliance and to defend UNiDAYS against claims or fraud, for monitoring of performance, to improve Our use of AI, for web analytics, to host data in the cloud, to carry out limited international transfers (Our business is across a number of countries), for the purposes of an acquisition or legal restructuring, to update member details and preferences, and for logistics.

Some examples of the information We collect, the purposes for that collection and the lawful basis:

### HOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures such as encryption, physical security, access restrictions to Our application to protect the personal information that We collect and process about you. The measures We use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.  
Where you have chosen a password that allows you to access certain parts of the Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your account log-in details, including your password, with anyone. We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.  
The transmission of information via the internet e.g by email is not completely secure. Although We will take steps to protect your information, We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Platform.

  


### DATA RETENTION

We retain personal information We collect from you where We have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  
When We have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, We will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then We will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. We will not keep personal information that identified you for longer than 2 years after your membership has expired.

  


### INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.  
Our Website servers, group companies (and staff) and third party service providers and Partners operate around the world. This means that when We collect your personal information it may be processed in any of these countries. However, We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected. These safeguards are either (a) signing model clauses with the third party; or (b) ensuring the third party is on the ‘Privacy Shield’ list; or (c) working with third parties in countries deemed to have adequate data protection laws.  
Additionally, if We share personal information with a third party acting as Our data processor, We remain responsible for how that information is processed. We will ensure We have a contract in place which sets out Our liability clearly.  
Our European Representative is: UNiDAYS GmbH, registered address: Auguste-Hauschner-Strabe 5 10785 Berlin.

  


### AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING

Our use of your personal information (including engagement behaviour) may result in automated decisions being taken, for example, which ads or content to show you. It is not Our intention that these decisions legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.  
Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without Our human review.  
When We make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contact Us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact Us” heading above.

  * If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting Us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact Us” heading above or alternatively you can access Our [right to be forgotten](https://www.myunidays.com/account/settings/delete) and [subject access request](https://www.myunidays.com/account/settings/subject-access-request) forms here.

  * Similarly, if We have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing We conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  * You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about Our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).)



We respond to all requests We receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  
Where We process your information based on Our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to that processing, subject to certain exceptions.
