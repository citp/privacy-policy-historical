                    <br><br>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, MY GYM may need to update this
                    Privacy Policy from time to time. MY GYM reserves the right to change, modify,
                    or otherwise alter our Privacy Policy at any time and at our sole discretion
                    without specific notice to you.   MY GYM will post any updated Privacy Policy
                    on our Site so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information
                    we may collect and how we may use this information. MY GYM encourages you to
                    review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of
                    this Site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to

                    Policy and shall constitute your acceptance and acknowledgement of the
                    then-current Privacy Policy.  

                    <br><br><strong>3. <u>Information Collection and Use</u>.</strong>

                    <br><br>You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable
                    information about yourself.  However, in certain sections of this Site, we may
                    require you to register for an account or a MY GYM class, or we may invite you
                    to submit questions or comments or request information, subscribe to
                    newsletters, and participate in surveys, questionnaires, promotions,
                    sweepstakes or contests.  Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may
                    ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable
                    information such as your name, username, email address, and other contact
                    information.  You may refuse to submit any personally identifiable information
                    through the Site in which case you can still view certain aspects of the Site
                    but will not be able to participate in certain services offered by the Site.  

                    <br><br>We may use your personally identifiable information to enroll your child in a
                    class, deliver certain services, products or information you have requested,
                    verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site,
                    send you notices for products and/or services that you have used or that may be
                    of interest to you, send you newsletters, and improve the content and general
                    administration of the Site. 

                    <br><br>You should not provide any personally identifiable information, register for an
                    account or class, subscribe to newsletters, or participate in surveys,
                    questionnaires, promotions, sweepstakes or contests unless you are at least 13
                    years of age.

                    <br><br><strong>4.<u>Children's Privacy</u>.</strong>

                    <br><br><strong>This Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 years old</strong>. 
                    MY GYM recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents
                    and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and
                    interests. MY GYM does not target or solicits our services or this Site to
                    children under 13 years of age but rather targets our services and this Site to
                    parents. MY GYM does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable
                    information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly permit any children
                    under the age of 13 years old to register with or use the Site.  If a user
                    indicates that he or she is under age 13 years old, the user will not be
                    permitted to register with or enter the Site or submit personally identifiable
                    information that would be transmitted to us via the Site.  In the event we
                    learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of
                    13 years of age via the Site, we will delete the information as soon as
                    possible.  If you believe we have information from or about a child under the age
                    of 13 years old, please contact us immediately by email at: <a href="mailto:mperez@mygym.com">mperez@mygym.com</a>.   

                    <br><br><strong>5. <u>Cookies</u>.</strong>

                    overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the web browser
                    of a user's hard drive.  Cookies do not store or contain personally
                    identifiable information.  Cookies enable us to “relate” a user’s activities on
                    and visits to our Site.  Cookies must be enabled for you to use certain areas
                    of the Site.

                    determine whether and how the third party advertisers use cookies.

                    <br><br>Users can program their web browsers to warn them every time a cookie is sent.  Users
                    can also program their web browsers to refuse cookies.  Please note that without
                    cookies users may not have access to certain services or content on the Site.

                    <br><br><strong>6. <u>Aggregate Information</u>.</strong>

                    statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and
                    disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally
                    identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze
                    trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad
                    demographic information for aggregate use. 

                    <br><br><strong>7. <u>Disclosure</u>.</strong>

                    <br><br>We may disclose your personally identifiable information that we collect and the
                    data generated by cookies to our parent, subsidiary or affiliate entities
                    within our corporate family, our franchisees, third party partner entities and
                    the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us. For example,
                    we may provide your personally identifiable information to an organization in
                    order to complete a service (e.g., process your payment). Such third party
                    entities will be restricted from further distributing your personally
                    identifiable information and may be obligated to a written confidentiality
                    agreement that is at least as protective of your personally identifiable
                    information as the terms of this Privacy Policy and they will not be permitted
                    to further distribute your personally identifiable information. However, such
                    third party entities may use your personally identifiable information to send
                    you marketing or promotional materials. We also will disclose your personally
                    identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by
                    law, regulation or other government authority. We may also disclose your
                    personally identifiable information to enforce the <strong><u>Terms of Use</u></strong>
                    or to protect the safety and security of our users.  We will not sell your
                    personally identifiable information to any other company or organization except
                    we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity
                    upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which MY GYM participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of MY GYM's assets to which this
                    Site relates. 

                    <br><br><strong>8. <u>Links to Third Party Sites</u>.</strong>

                    <br><br>The Site may provide links to other websites or resources operated by other
                    companies over which MY GYM does not own, operate or control ("External
                    Websites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by MY GYM of those External Websites. You acknowledge and agree that MY GYM is providing these links to
                    you only as a convenience, and further agree that MY GYM is not responsible for
                    the content of such External Websites. Your use of External Websites is subject
                    to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Websites. 
                    You should review the privacy policies and terms of use of any External
                    Websites to determine how these websites collect and/or use your personally
                    identifiable information.

                    <strong>9. <u>Security</u>.</strong>

                    <br><br> We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry
                    practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally
                    identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
                    alteration or destruction. MY GYM may use firewalls, internal restrictions,
                    password protection and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized
                    access to or disclosure of your personally identifiable information. 

                    <br><br><strong>10.<u>Consent</u>.</strong>

                    <br><br>Youruse including, without limitation, to your provision of personally identifiable
                    information constitutes your consent to our collection and use of your personal
