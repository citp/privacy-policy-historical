**Cookies**  
In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to store your e-mail ID on your computer so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit myGeek.com. We never use cookies to capture or contain personal information from your computer. The only personal information myGeek.com has is what you give to us. 

This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers who may be on the myGeek.com Web site. myGeek.com uses an outside ad company, L90, to display ads on our site, and these ads may contain cookies (see L90 privacy statement at [<http://www.l90.com/external_site/privacy_policy.html>]. While myGeek.com has control over cookies placed on other parts of our Web site, our ad company collects cookies received with banner ads, and we do not have access to their information.

When establishing a Guest account with myGeek.com you will be asked to submit a request with your e-mail address. We will also ask you to provide us some demographics information including your home zip code and the country in which the product will be sent. Providing such information will allow myGeek Sellers to provide you the most accurate shipping information. 

We use your e-mail address information to respond to your e-mail requests and to reach you if we need additional information to complete your product request. We may also contact you about promotional or upcoming events, or to take part in on-line focus groups or surveys. You may opt-out of these mailings as outlined below.

You may update your myGeek.com registration information at any time. Simply select the "Edit Profile" link located on the Home Page to update or change information.

**Additional Information Collected**  
Any personal correspondence you send to us, including e-mail and letters, as well as correspondence from other customers or third parties about your activities or postings pertaining to myGeek.com, and all entries made by you onto our site may be collected and stored. Any notes, ideas, suggestions, or other material submitted by Users becomes the property of myGeek.com. 

myGeek.com may run contests where we ask Users for contact information such as e-mail or physical addresses. myGeek.com may retain a third party company to oversee the collection and correct entry of User's contact information. The aforementioned third party company will also supply and oversee distribution of prizes for such contests. The User information collected during the contest will not be used by the third party for any purpose other than that of running the myGeek.com contest. myGeek.com may use contact data from our contests to send Users information about myGeek.com, as well as promotional material from some of our partners. You may opt-out of receiving these and future mailings as outlined below. 

**Unsupervised Children**  
Children 18 and under are not eligible to use myGeek.com services without the participation and supervision of a legal parent or guardian. myGeek.com is not a site meant for children, and we do not provide privacy measures designed to protect children when using the Internet unsupervised. 

**Referrals**  
MyGeek.com encourages User referrals. We will request the e-mail address of the referred party. With this information, myGeek will send the referred party a refer-a-friend e-mail. Unless initiated by the referred User, myGeek.com will not send any additional communication. 

**Expunging Your Information From Our Records**  
You may e-mail [CustomerService@myGeek.com](mailto:customerservice@myGeek.com) or use one of the alternate contact methods listed below to remove your contact information from our database provided we have completed all your pending transactions. Please note, however, that information is never completely removed from our history and disaster recovery archives. 

**_Disclosure of Information to Third Parties_**

**Personal Information**  
Your information is kept anonymous and will not be shared with other Users. myGeek.com will e-mail the User requesting an item with the link to where they can find their requested product on the Seller's web site. If the User purchases the product, they will do so on the Seller's site, not through myGeek.com. The Seller will collect all of the necessary information to fulfill the order. We encourage you to read the privacy policies located on the Seller's web site. 

myGeek.com does not sell, trade, rent, or release your personal information to third parties. If we were to ever do so, you will have the opportunity to opt-out beforehand. 

**Transactional Information**  
myGeek.com transactional information such as traffic patterns, sales, aggregate data regarding general shopping patterns, and other site information may be shared with vendors and other reputable third parties. This data will never contain any identifiable personal information of myGeek.com Users. For example, we might share statistics on how many customers purchased a specific product, but we will not specifically disclose who purchased the product. 

**Legal Issues**  
myGeek.com discloses personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary for the following: 

  * To conform to the edict of the law or comply with a legal process served on myGeek.com or its Web site. 
  * To protect and defend the property rights of myGeek.com, the myGeek.com Web site, or that of myGeek.com Users. 
  * Or to act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of myGeek.com Users, employees, or the general public. 



**Other Sites' Policies**  
myGeek.com has no control over, nor does it bear any of the responsibility for the privacy policies and/or content of any sites or advertisers linked to or on our site. myGeek.com also takes no responsibility for the cookies these sites or advertisers might deposit on your hard drive. 

**_Safety and Security_**

**Security**  
After we receive the data at myGeek.com, it is stored on a secure server behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. All data is secure and is protected from alteration, loss or misuse. The myGeek.com employees who process your order are the only people with access to your personal information. All myGeek.com employees sign a privacy/security policy agreement, which provides legal confidentiality protections for all myGeek.com Users. Any violation of this policy results in disciplinary action, including possible termination, criminal prosecution, and civil action. 

When our registration/order form asks Users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), the information you provide is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, you will know that you are on a secure page because the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer is in its locked form, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, protect all user-information off-line. For example,, all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is subject to restricted use in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

**_Your Consent & Contacting Us_**

**Your Consent**  
By using the myGeek.com Web site, you consent to the collection, storage, and dissemination of personal data as described above. We will post any changes to our privacy policy on this page so you can readily review the most current policy. myGeek.com reserves the right to e-mail you regarding changes to our privacy policy or any other matters myGeek.com considers necessary for the administration of the site.
