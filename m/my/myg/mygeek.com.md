Because our privacy policy may be updated periodically, we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.

**_Information Collected and How It's Used_**

**Your IP Address**  
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is automatically assigned to your computer every time you establish a connection on the Internet. myGeek.com uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. myGeek.com does not link your IP address to any identifiable personal information.

**Cookies**  
In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to store your e-mail ID on your computer so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit myGeek.com. We never use cookies to capture or contain personal information from your computer. The only personal information myGeek.com has is what you give to us.

This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers who may be on the myGeek.com Web site. myGeek.com uses an outside ad company to display ads on our site, and these ads may contain cookies. While myGeek.com has control over cookies placed on other parts of our Web site, our ad company collects cookies received with banner ads, and we do not have access to their information.

**Your Account** When establishing a Guest account with myGeek.com you will be asked to submit a request with your e-mail address. We will also ask you to provide us some demographics information including your home zip code and the country in which the product will be sent. Providing such information will allow myGeek Sellers to provide you the most accurate shipping information.

We use your e-mail address information to respond to your e-mail requests and to reach you if we need additional information to complete your product request. We may also contact you about promotional or upcoming events, or to take part in on-line focus groups or surveys. You may opt-out of these mailings as outlined below.

You control all your personal account information and you can update it at any time. Simply select the "my Account" link located on the top of every screen, or contact [customerservice@myGeek.com](mailto:customerservice@myGeek.com) to update, change or remove your information.

When establishing a Seller account with myGeek.com you will be asked to complete a Seller registration form which includes the company name, contact name, street address, country, phone number, user name, and e-mail address. You will also be asked if you would like to be notified once a day or each time a request is made in your selected categories. Sellers may update their myGeek.com registration information at any time. Simply select the "Edit Profile" link located on the Seller Home Page to update or change information. Sellers wishing to discontinue their account with myGeek.com may do so at any time by contacting [sellers@mygeek.com](mailto:sellers@mygeek.com).

Any notes, ideas, suggestions, or other material submitted by Guests becomes the property of myGeek.com.

myGeek.com may run contests where we ask Guests for contact information such as e-mail or physical addresses. myGeek.com may retain a third party company to oversee the collection and correct entry of Guest's contact information. The aforementioned third party company will also supply and oversee distribution of prizes for such contests. The Guest information collected during the contest will not be used by the third party for any purpose other than that of running the myGeek.com contest. myGeek.com may use contact data from our contests to send Guests information about myGeek.com, as well as promotional material from some of our partners. You may opt-out of receiving these and future mailings as outlined below.

Children 17 and under are not eligible to use myGeek.com services without the participation and supervision of a legal parent or guardian. myGeek.com is not a site meant for children, and we do not provide privacy measures designed to protect children when using the Internet unsupervised.

**Referrals**  
MyGeek.com encourages Guest and Seller referrals. We will request the e-mail address of the referred party. With this information, myGeek will send the referred party a refer-a-friend e-mail. Unless initiated by the referred Guest or Seller, myGeek.com will not send any additional communication.

Please note, however, that information is never completely removed from our history and disaster recovery archives.

**_Disclosure of Information to Third Parties_**

**Personal Information**  
Guest information is kept anonymous and will not be shared with the Sellers. myGeek.com will e-mail the Guest with the link to where they can find their requested product on the Seller's web site.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies located on the Seller's web site.

myGeek.com transactional information such as traffic patterns, sales, aggregate data regarding general shopping patterns, and other site information may be shared with vendors and other reputable third parties. This data will never contain any identifiable personal information of myGeek.com Guests. For example, we might share statistics on how many customers purchased a specific product, but we will not specifically disclose who purchased the product.

**Legal Issues**  
myGeek.com discloses personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary for the following: 

  * To conform to the edict of the law or comply with a legal process served on myGeek.com or its Web site.

After we receive the data at myGeek.com, it is stored on a secure server behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. All data is secure and is protected from alteration, loss or misuse. The myGeek.com employees who process your order are the only people with access to your personal information. All myGeek.com employees sign a privacy/security policy agreement, which provides legal confidentiality protections for all myGeek.com Guests. Any violation of this policy results in disciplinary action, including possible termination, criminal prosecution, and civil action.
