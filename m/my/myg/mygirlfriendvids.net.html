It is our policy not to use or share the personal information about Browsers or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Browsers or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms &amp; Conditions or other user policies;
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. To operate our Services properly;
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. To protect ourselves, our Members, and the general public. We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. We will always cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party litigants, and others seeking information about our end users to the extent required by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.

If you opt out of these marketing emails, you may still receive system notices and other information that is specifically related to your account.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you provide your information to us, use the SITE, or subscribe to any of our services, you will have created a commercial relationship with us. In having done so, you understand that even unsolicited commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the law.

<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII. Public Forums and Other Public Areas:

<br>
<br>
A. Public Forums â€“ at the time of the instatement of this Policy, we currently offer Users the option to comment in public forums, to send private messages to other Users, and to comment on other User's profiles, and we reserve the right to offer other interactive features in the future. We also provide services that allow Members to post messages or comments to the public. Any and all information posted to the SITE, whether as a comment to a video or any other post, should immediately be considered to be public information.

<br>
<br>
<br>
IX. Our Commitment to Data Security.

<br>
<br>
We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party 'hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.
