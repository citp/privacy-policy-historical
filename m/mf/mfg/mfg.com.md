**Physical Security**

Our production equipment is collocated in Geneva, Switzerland and Atlanta, USA at facilities that provide 24-hour physical security, redundant electrical generators, redundant data center air conditioners, and other backup equipment designed to keep servers continually up and running.

**Perimeter Defense**

The network perimeter is protected by multiple firewalls and monitored by intrusion detection systems Ñ all sourced from industry-leading security vendors. In addition, MFG.com monitors and analyzes firewall logs to proactively identify security threats.

**Data Encryption**

MFG.com leverages the strongest encryption products to protect customer data and communications, including 128-bit SSL Certification and 1024-bit RSA public keys. The lock icon in the browser indicates that data is fully shielded from access while in transit.

**User Authentication**

Users access MFG.com only with a valid username and password combination, which is encrypted via SSL while in transmission. An encrypted session ID cookie is used to uniquely identify each user. For added security, the session key is automatically scrambled and re-established in the background at regular intervals. MFG.com website username and passwords are to be kept confidential. You may not disclose or share your username or password with any third parties.

**Application Security**

Our robust application security model prevents one MFG.com customer from accessing another's data. This security model is reapplied with every request and enforced for the entire duration of a user session.

**Internal Systems Security**

Inside of the perimeter firewalls, the systems are safeguarded by network address translation, port redirection and more. The specific details of these features are proprietary.

**Operating System Security**

MFG.com enforces tight operating system-level security by using a minimal number of access points to all production servers. We protect all operating system accounts with strong passwords, and production servers do not share a master password.

**Database Security**

Whenever possible, database access is controlled at the operating system and database connection level for additional security. Access to production databases is restricted to a limited number of points, and production databases do not share a master password database.

**Third Party Caching Service**

MFG.com Websites utilize a "best of breed" third party caching service to ensure faster load and response times of MFG.com web pages as well as accelerated route optimization to ensure data is served up to users in the most efficient manner possible. No proprietary user data is stored on these third party servers in the form of cached data. The elimination of the number of hops in accessing data as well as the third party vendors stringent security methods provide additional security and integrity to the MFG.com Websites.

**Server Management Security**

All data entered into the MFG.com sourcing application by a customer is owned by that customer. MFG.com employees do not have direct access to the MFG.com production equipment, except where necessary for system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups. MFG.com does not utilize any managed service providers. The MFG.com systems engineering team provides all system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups.

**Reliability and Backup**

All networking components, SSL accelerators, load balancers, Web servers, and application servers are configured in a redundant configuration. All customer data is stored on a database served by a database server cluster for redundancy. All customer data is stored on carrier-class disk storage using RAID disks and multiple data paths. All customer data, up to the last committed transaction, is automatically backed up to a primary tape library on a nightly basis. Backup tapes are moved to secure, fire-resistant, off-site storage on a regular basis.

**Security**
