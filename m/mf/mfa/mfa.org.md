The MFA does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and credit/debit card numbers (“Personal Information”), unless the individual visiting the MFA, the MFA Web site, or Online Store (collectively referred to as the “MFA”) voluntarily provides it. By visiting the MFA and using the MFA Web Site, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of MFA’s Privacy Policy. By providing Personal Information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be revised from time to time.
