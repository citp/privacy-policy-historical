                Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services provided, or information obtained, other than through the Site. Please read the following policy to 
                understand how your information will be treated. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. Please keep in mind that some 
                of the services mentioned specifically in this policy may not be available on the site at this time. If you have questions concerning this policy, please

				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
				    Miller's collects information in several ways. For example, some personal 
				    information is gathered when you register as a customer using our account 
				    interface. During registration, we may ask for your Miller's Account Number and 
				    your email address. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to Miller's 
				    and are able to take full advantage of our services. In addition to 
				    registration, we may ask you for information at other times, such as when you 
				    report a problem with our site or services, or contact the company via the 
				    corporate e-mail address. If you contact Miller's, we may keep a record of that 
				    correspondence.<br>
				    <br>
				    If you believe that any inaccurate or inappropriate information has been 
				    obtained or disseminated through your use of this Site, you should contact a 
				    representative of Miller's at <a href="mailto:customerservice@mpix.com">customerservice@mpix.com</a>

				    Miller's is committed to providing you with a safe environment to upload, 
				    share, market and order photos of professional photographers. Except for photos 
				    the photographer chooses to publish to a public album as part of the Service 
				    without password protection, photos are generally protected by a password or 
				    event number, or are published on a non-public URL, and are accessible only to 
				    people who are aware of that particular URL.<br>

				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
				    As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, many 
				    Web sites use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A 
				    cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server 
				    and stored on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies to allow faster 
				    and easier access to your account information, monitor traffic on the site and 
				    measure traffic patterns to improve functionality. Miller's Web pages may in 
				    the future contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called 
				    clear giffs or Web bugs) or other advanced technologies that are useful in the 
				    provision of services to you. We may use such devices to verify compliance with 
				    our terms and conditions of use or with any promotions on the site.<br>

				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
					Miller's primary goal in collecting information is to improve the site and 
					provide the user with the best possible experience on the site. We will also 
					use your personal information to notify you of other products or services 
					available from Miller's and its affiliates.<br>
					<br>
					Except as provided herein, only Miller's and its affiliates will have access to 
					individuals' account information. We also may do research on our users' 
					demographics and behavior based on the information provided to us upon 
					registration, gathered from transaction activity, from our server log files or 
					from surveys. This research may be compiled, analyzed or sold on an anonymous 
					aggregated basis, which does not include information that would identify you. 
					Miller's also may share this data with business partners or other third 
					parties.<br>
				</div>
                <div style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#404040; padding-bottom:5px; border-bottom:solid 1px #333; width:100%;">Who is collecting information?</div>
				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
					When you are on a Miller's site and are asked for personal information, you are 
					sharing that information with Miller's and its affiliates and service 
					providers. If personal data is to be collected and/or maintained by any company 
					other than Miller's or its affiliates or service providers, we will attempt to 
					notify you on the Site or in an updated version of this Privacy Policy. If you 
					do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by 
					not using that particular service.<br>
					<br>
					Please be aware that other Web sites to which we link may collect personally 
					identifiable information about you when you visit those sites. The information 
					practices of other Web sites linked to our Sites are not covered by this 
					Privacy Policy.<br>
				</div>

				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
					We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except 
					when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we 
					believe in good faith that the law requires it, or under the circumstances 
					described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information 
					may be disclosed.<br>
					<br>
					<u>Data in the Aggregate</u>: We may disclose "blinded" aggregated data and 
					user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other 
					lawful purposes. Blinded data is data which does not identify an individual 
					person.<br>
					<br>
					<u>Other</u>: We also may disclose account information in special cases when we 
					have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
					identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating 
					Miller's <a href="" onclick="return ToggleDiv(divprefix + '2');">Terms of Use</a>, 
					or other online or signed agreement with Millers, or that may otherwise be 
					causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or 
					unintentionally) Miller's rights or property, other Miller's Site users or 
					customers, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may 
					disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the 
					law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem 
					necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.<br>

					<br>
					We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, 
					including packaging, delivering or mailing, answering customer questions about 
					products or services, sending postal mail, providing investor information and 
					processing data. We will only provide those companies the information they need 
					to deliver the service, and they are contractually prohibited from using that 
					information for any other purpose.<br>
					<br>
					As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or 
					assets. In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is 
					one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a transaction involving 
					the sale of some or all of Miller's businesses, customer and site visitor 
					information may be one of the transferred assets.<br>

					Miller's offers its customers choices for the use and sharing of personal 
					information. You may contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@mpix.com">customerservice@mpix.com</a>. 
					If you wish to view, edit or delete your personal information from our 
					database, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your 
					request.<br>

                <div style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#404040; padding-bottom:5px; border-bottom:solid 1px #333; width:100%;">How does Miller's protect financial-related information?</div>
                <div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
                    Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. 
				    As a matter of policy and long time business practice, Miller's does not sell 
				    information provided by its customers. Any user statistics that we may provide 
				    to prospective partners regarding financial matters are provided in the 
				    aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about 
				    any individual user. We will transfer your credit card number, bank account 
				    number or other personal information to the appropriate credit card company or 
				    bank in order to process any online payments.<br>
				</div>
                <div style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#404040; padding-bottom:5px; border-bottom:solid 1px #333; width:100%;">What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of my information?</div>
				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
					Your Miller's Account Information and Miller's Profile are password-protected 
					so you have access to this personal information. We use encryption technology 
					to protect credit card numbers, bank account numbers, passwords and 
					registration information while they are being transferred over the public 
					Internet. Remember to sign out of your Miller's account and close your browser 
					window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot 
					access your account by using your computer when you are away from it. Because 
					of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us information, that 
					information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where 
					you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission 
					over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Except as discussed 
					above or otherwise designated, this site does not use security encryption 
					measures. Therefore, information that you disclose by use of this site (as with 
					any site that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e mail, potentially 
					could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages 
					from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own 
					purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive to protect your 
					personal information, Miller's cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 
					information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own 
					risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use commercially reasonable efforts 
					to ensure its security on our systems.<br>

				<div style="padding:5px 0px 15px 0px; line-height:20px;">
					Miller's respects the intellectual property rights of others. We claim no 
					ownership rights in any image contained in any of your photo albums and will 
					not share your images unless instructed by you or otherwise required by law or 
					permitted under a separate agreement with you. Please note that when you share 
					a photo album, you allow the recipients of that album to share and make that 
					album and the photos in it available to others. For more information, see the 
					applicable Terms of Service.<br>
