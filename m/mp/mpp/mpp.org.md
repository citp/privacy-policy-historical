### **1\. WHY WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION**

MPP collects and uses personal information to provide individuals with news and information regarding MPP. In addition, we use personal information to keep email subscribers up-to-date on the latest marijuana policy news and information we think they’d like to hear about.

### **2\. TYPE OF DATA COLLECTED**

MPP may collect the following information for users upon submitting forms on mpp.org:

  1. Name
  2. Email
  3. Phone number
  4. Address
  5. City
  6. State
  7. Browser information
  8. Other information provided by users



### **3\. WHEN WE DISCLOSE CONTACT INFORMATION**

Except as provided in this policy, MPP will not share any of your personal information at any time with any organization. Given that MPP is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States, we may contact you on behalf of another organization doing work related to ours. These updates will be sent by MPP personnel via MPP’s secure system. Your personal information will only be handled by MPP employees who are knowledgeable of all rules and policies regarding securely handling all information. They will protect your personal information in accordance with MPP’s Privacy Policy.

MPP occasionally allows other organizations to send mail to individuals on its lists. In these cases, lists containing only names and addresses (no contribution data or other personal information) are delivered to a third-party mailing house for one-time use for that organization’s mailing. To request that we never allow your contact information to be used even in this secure manner, please contact [ **membership@mpp.org**](mailto:membership@mpp.org). If possible, please include your full name, postal address, phone number, and the email address at which you receive messages from MPP.

MPP is dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for your personal information.

### **4\. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

MPP safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the internet.

MPP uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all webpages where donations are submitted. To make donations to MPP or organizations supported by MPP, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. (Any current version of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Safari will work.) This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the internet.

### **5\. ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If you would like your personal information updated, modified, or removed, you can contact [ **membership@mpp.org**](mailto:membership@mpp.org) with your request. If possible, please include your full name, postal address, phone number, and the email address at which you receive messages from MPP.
