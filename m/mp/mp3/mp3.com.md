# MP3.com Privacy Policy

MP3.com is committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our Web site. In order to enhance your experience at our site we gather certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to your tastes and preferences. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our Web site. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.

**What information do we collect?**  
MP3.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site. 

MP3.com collects some personal information when you initially access our site. We may ask for your name, email address, zip code, country, language preference, gender, and certain age information (such as whether you are over 21). The more information you share with us (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to enhance and customize your experience on our site. 

In addition to the information we collect upon your initial access to our site, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you make a purchase through our online store, when you enter promotions or contests and when you respond to a survey. For example, when you make a purchase through our online store, we collect several items of personal information, including your billing and shipping address, telephone number, credit card information, and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. 

Wherever MP3.com collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

**What information do parties other than MP3.com collect?**  
Some advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you when you access or utilize those links. MP3.com does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

**What are "cookies" and how do we use them?**  
MP3.com uses "Cookies" to track and record your preferences and activity on our Web site. Cookies are small bits of data that are sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Your cookie may be set at various times during your interaction with our Web site. It is updated from time to time as you access the many different portions of our Web site. Each time you access our site, our server may deliver certain customized information to you based on the data stored in your cookie. 

Some advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may also use their own cookies. 

We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our sponsors and advertisers.

**What do we do with the information we collect?**  
MP3.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our Web site. The information we collect (including information contained in your cookie) may be used to provide such capabilities as personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping, and personalized communication between you and the artists you prefer. We may also use the information to estimate the size of our audience and measure certain traffic patterns, to track the progress and number of entries in our promotions and contests, to track visits to and business conducted at our online store, to notify our visitors about updates to our Web site, to contact you for marketing purposes, to contact you on behalf of certain artists and other third parties and deliver targeted advertisements that may be of interest to you. We may occasionally contact you with information regarding special events at MP3.com. **If you ever receive a type of communication that you would not like to receive, you will have the option to unsubscribe from such communication (usually at the bottom of the page).**

**With whom do we share your information and for what purpose?**  
MP3.com does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s). If we intend to share such information, you will be notified prior to the collection of that information. If you do not want your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion or contest. 

In addition, when you make a purchase through our online store, or sign up to receive promotional items from us, we may share some of your personal information with third parties helping us to complete your transaction or send you the items you signed up to receive. When we share your information with such third parties, we will work to ensure that only the information necessary to complete your transaction is disclosed. Finally, we reserve the right to share your information (i) with any affiliated companies or subsidiaries owned or controlled by MP3.com, if any, provided that they are also bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy; (ii) if we are required to do so by law; or (iii) if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend MP3's rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of MP3's network; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of MP3's staff or the public. 

**Your Consent**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by MP3.com as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

**Information about MP3.com's Music Greetings**  
Please read this information carefully. Use of MP3.com's ("MP3") Music Greetings service indicates your agreement with the rules and conditions listed below. 

When you send an MP3 Music Greeting, we use the information you provide us with to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and your message, and to deliver an email notification to the recipient. We treat Music Greetings as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and will not disclose the contents of Music Greetings, other than to the intended recipient, unless we are required to do so by law or for other reasons set forth herein. Misuse of MP3's Music Greetings service by providing a false email address or posing as someone else when sending a Music Greeting, may result in the cancellation of your membership and the disclosure of information about you, including your computer's IP address, as part of any investigation into your actions. 

Under normal circumstances, MP3 will not monitor or edit the contents of the Music Greetings you send. Occasionally, however, MP3 personnel may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your greeting or the maintenance of our network. Likewise, if you contact an MP3 customer service representative to help you send a card or to verify that a card was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient's email address and the message. Although MP3 uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive your information in error. 

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**  
From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy. We will post those changes on this page so that our customers will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we share the information with others.
