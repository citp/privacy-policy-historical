# Privacy Policy

Since your privacy is important to us, MP3 Rocket has created this privacy statement in order to let you know our firm commitment to your privacy.

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the MP3 Rocket website: http://www.mp3rocket.me

## Information collection

Our programs do not collect any kind of personal information.

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you buy MP3 Rocket Pro Membership for our software, or you want to provide us with your personal data, to give us the opportunity to get in touch with you.

When you enter a contest or other promotional event, we may ask for information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

When you buy MP3 Rocket Pro Membership, we may ask you for information such as your name, e-mail address, and shipping address.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use this information for any other purposes.

When a user submits personal information, it is kept on a private server not accessible from the Internet. This limits the possibility of any malicious use of your information.

## Use of personal information

MP3 Rocket will not share any individual customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties mentioned above, without first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, MP3 Rocket does not sell users' personal information to lists. In some cases, MP3 Rocket may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue.
