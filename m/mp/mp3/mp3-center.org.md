# Mp3-center.org Free Mp3 Downloads

Privacy is becoming a major concern on the Internet now, because of the popularity of the Internet some businesses have taken advantage of the huge amounts of data they have collected through their web sites by 'spamming' or by adding you to annoying mailing lists which you don't even remember signing up to. 

MP3-center.org does not require you to disclose personal information anywhere on the site, so it's not a major problem. However in the event that we do adopt features to the site which require you to fill out forms requiring your personal information we will make it optional and we will never, ever make the information accessible to the public, sell it to anyone or use it for any purposes except for our own research.
