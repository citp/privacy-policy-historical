**What We Collect**

We collect basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes pages visited, products purchased, and feedback from our visitors.

We use cookies to hasten navigation, track purchases, package contents and remember information so that you do not have to provide us with login details each time you visit our site. Cookies show us how and when shoppers use the site and monitor which areas are popular and which are not. With the data collected, we can improve our updates to the site based on the total number of visitors and pages viewed.

Most browsers have been set to accept cookies. You can set yours to refuse cookies. You will still be able to order from **MPH Online.com** using the Shopping Cart.

When you create an account with us, you provide such personal information as: 

  * First and last name 
  * Billing address 
  * Shipping address(es) 
  * Email address 
  * Phone number 
  * Credit card account number 
  * Titles of items you purchase from us 
  * Product categories that interest you 

**Using Collected Information**

We collect this information on the pages where you'd created the MyStuff Account. We use this information as follows: 

  1. To fulfill your order 
  2. To provide you with information about your order (such as, whether your order has been received, processed, or shipped). 
  3. To contact you via phone in the event that our customer service people need to contact you and cannot reach you by email. 
  4. To inform you about special offers, products, or events that we think will interest you. You can uncheck email promotional updates or change your preferences at any time by going to the MyStuff Account page and selecting Account Profile. 
  5. To bill you for products you have ordered and track sales 
  6. To notify you about new releases when you sign up for our free mailing list 

**Who Gets The Information**

We work with sponsoring and advertising companies that require that we disclose purchasing information about customers who visit the **MPH Online.com** sit. We disclose only the information required which includes the name and/or email address of the user as well as the amount and quantity of purchases.

We disclose this information to these companies under an agreement that requires that they obtain your consent first, usually under the membership or participation rules. If you do not want us to disclose that information to the strategic partner, then you must contact them directly. Usually, that will preclude you from participating in the special promotions or rewards offered by that company.

**Changing My Information**

Just go to **Account** link at the top right of any page to take you to the page. Click on Account Profile. Here you can change or update your email address and password, billing address, payment options, shipping options. Then click Save My Changes.

To unsubscribe from our mailing list or email announcements, simply hit Reply to any message you receive and type the words "unsubscribe". Please reply to the email using the email address at which you have received mailings from us, and we will remove you from our list.

**Children's Privacy**

We do not collect information from a child without the consent of the child's parent(s). Before signing up for a service that requests disclosure of personal information, children under 16 must obtain parental consent. We suggest that parents get involved with their children's access to the Internet and our site to ensure that their child's privacy is well protected.

**Others**

We also reserve the right to report to the law regarding unlawful activities. When you click on links or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. We cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever using another web site.

We may update this policy from time to time. Please check this page for changes.
