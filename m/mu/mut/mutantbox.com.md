**2\. What Information Is Collected**

Personal information: Mutantbox’s primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service.

When you install any of the Mutantbox games or applications, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through the social networking website in accordance with their policies and terms.

The types of personal information collected in accordance with the activities listed above may vary depending on the activity. Personal information may include:

i. Your name;

ii. User identification number;

iii. Email address;

iv. Home address;

v. Phone number.

vi. Instant message account

Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as your IP address, but that may be considered part of an individual's personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.

Additionally, we may acquire information from you through:

i.Your access and participation in message boards on the Service;

ii.Your email of a question to our customer support;

iii.Your purchase of a virtual product of any type.

When you play a Mutantbox game, on Mutantbox's website at www.mutantbox.com (the "Site") or on your social network page or on someone else's page or through your mobile device, we may record information regarding the use of that game, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.

The Service will also record game play information such as your high scores or game session duration. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through Mutantbox's applications, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email address and content.

Financial information: When you pay for products offered for purchase though the Service, we will also collect your billing address and complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment. Our payment processing service provider may also retain this information to enable you to purchase additional items through our Service without having to re-enter it each time. We do not directly access, store or collect your credit card information and we will not use your payment information we collect except as needed to fulfill your purchase and/or communicate with you regarding your transaction.

Mutantbox will never at any time ask you for your credit card or bank account information, your login or password, or national identification numbers via any unsolicited means, including email and telephone calls.

Third Party Cookies: We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the site. These companies may collect and use information about your visits to this and other websites and your interaction with our products and services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

They may use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services and may be used to keep track of user response to each advertisement. These targeted advertisements may appear on the site or on other sites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag or cookies, which are industry standard technologies used by most major websites. If you do not want such companies to collect this information you may opt-out.

**7\. Cookies and Other Information on a User's Machine**

Mutantbox’s products, services and sites may employ cookies and other technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags. Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to a user's hard drive to customize a person's use of a product or online site, keep records of a user's access to an online site or product, or store information needed by the user on a regular basis. Use of cookies is typically associated with websites. For example, when you sign in to Mutantbox online websites , we stores your user id and a combination of your IP address and time of login as a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie allows you to move from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. Similarly, if you enter information during your session, such as age verification data, this will be stored as a cookie and you will not have to re-enter such information during that session. We may also use third party web site analytic tools that employ cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information concerning use of our websites, such as referring web site addresses, page views and browser types.

However, users can disable cookies by changing their browser settings. Mutantbox also stores on a user’s hard drive a unique authorization key or CD-Key that is either entered by the user or downloaded automatically during product registration. This authorization key is used to identify a user as valid and allow access to Mutantbox's products, services and third party games. This key is necessary for Mutantbox to supply any products and services subscribed by users.

Information regarding Mutantbox billing, a user’s Mutantbox account, a user's Internet connection and the Mutantbox software installed on a user's computer is uploaded to the server in connection with the user's use of Steam and Mutantbox software. Mutantbox software automatically generates and submits to Mutantbox bug reports upon a crash or other fault in the Mutantbox software, services or Steam games. This automatically generated bug report information may include information about other software or hardware on a user's system. Mutantbox does not associate and store the automatically generated bug report information with users’ personally identifiable information. Any bug reporting information manually submitted by users (e.g. through Mutantbox's Bug Reporter form) is associated and stored with personally identifiable information sent voluntarily by the user through a bug report.

**8\. Changes to Privacy Policy**

Mutantbox may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Service or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Service after such changes have been first posted. If you object to any change, your sole recourse shall be to immediately terminate your account and cease using the Site and Service.
