Mutual of Omaha Bank (“Mutual of Omaha”) respects the privacy of visitors of mutualofomahabank.com, mutualofomahaebank.com and all sites and mobile applications, if any, linking to this On-Line Privacy Policy (“Policy”) (collectively “sites”). This Policy applies to these sites and explains how Mutual of Omaha may collect, use and share information about you from our sites. We encourage you to read our Policy before using the sites. By visiting our sites you are agreeing in advance to the current and future terms of this Policy, and we have the right to use your information as described in this Policy. If you do not wish to agree to these terms, you should leave the site. 

In addition to this Policy, Mutual of Omaha's written Consumer Privacy Notice ([Consumer Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/-/media/Files/Master-Privacy-Notice_-2-15-17.ashx?la=en&hash=71D08BA8D8283903EDE529D31170565CD4E419C3)) further describes how we collect, use, and share personal information (defined below) shared with us, such as when you apply for or purchase our products and services becoming our customer.

The following sections address our sites’ on-line privacy practices in more detail:

### Types of information collected on our sites

There are two types of information collected on our sites: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. 

####  Personally Identifiable Information 

Personally Identifiable Information (“personal information”) is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, age range, etc. Personal information may also include geo-location, phone carrier, or other device information. Personal information may be obtained when you voluntarily provide the information to us and when we collect your geo-location, phone carrier, or other device information directly or through our third party vendor(s). 

####  Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“non-personal information”) is information that does not identify you as an individual, such as your browser type, IP Address, and the URL of the web sites you visited before or after our site. Mutual of Omaha may automatically collect certain types of non-personal information from you when you use our sites. We may also collect non-personal information that you voluntarily provide, such as information included in response to a questionnaire or survey.

### Why we collect your information

Mutual of Omaha may use personal information it can collect on our sites for a variety of reasons related to fraud protection, obtaining a better understanding of your needs and interests, and to develop and provide you with products, services, and features that better meet your needs or requests.

### How we collect information

Mutual of Omaha collects on-line information when you provide it to us or through the use of technology (an example would be form submissions). 

####  Information Collected Through You 

If you choose to use certain services on our sites, we may require you to provide contact and identity information. We indicate which fields must be completed to take advantage of a particular service or feature. 

####  Non-Personal Information Collected Through Technology 

####  Cookies: 

Our sites may use cookie technology to improve your experience and gather information for statistical reporting. Cookie technology does not capture your individual email address or any personal information about you.

A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a site that is saved on your electronic device. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on our sites’ home pages) and gathers statistical information, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the Internet provider’s domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before and after coming to our sites. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate. Mutual of Omaha Bank may also use cookies in conjunction with third party services to obtain demographic data on visitors to our sites. Examples of information collected include information to enable us to provide products and services that may better suit your needs. Although this information is associated with unique browsers, visitors' identities remain anonymous to Mutual of Omaha.

To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. 

####  IP Address: 

Our sites may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, authentication and security, server problem diagnosis and compiling aggregate information, such as how many visitors accessed our sites. When you visit a particular page on our sites, our servers may log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. 

**Embedded Pixels:**

We may use embedded pixel technologies on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits to our sites as opposed to aggregate hits. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in emails to provide information on when the email was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness. Information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient's email address.

### Who we share personal information with

We may share personal information among Mutual of Omaha and its affiliated companies, including our insurance affiliates and with select third parties as permitted or required by law. For information on who we may share your personal information with once you apply for our products or services, or become our customer, view our Privacy Notice referenced above.

**Disclosure of personal information for legal purposes and protection of Mutual of Omaha and others:**

We also reserve the right to share your personal information with third parties if we believe such action is necessary in order to: (a) conform with the requirements of any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (b) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our sites or our users; or (c) investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of the terms and conditions of using our sites.

### Children’s privacy

Unless otherwise specified, our sites are not directed toward children. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that personal information on a child under the age of 13 is collected, we will delete that information from our systems. 

### Keeping your information secure

The security of your personal information is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. We have security measures in place that seek to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that Mutual of Omaha has collected from you through our sites. 

Unfortunately, no information transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Mutual of Omaha cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our on-line products or services, and you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our sites.
