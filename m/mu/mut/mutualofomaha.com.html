			<p> This Privacy Policy applies to all services and sub-sites available under the domain Mutual of Omaha.com We encourage you to read our privacy policy before using the site. By visiting this web site, you are agreeing in advance to the current and future terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to agree to these terms, you should leave this web site. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> There are two types of information collected on Mutual of Omaha.com: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
			<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
			<p> Personally Identifiable Information (“personal information”) is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, age range, etc. Personal information is only obtained when you voluntarily provide the information to us. Mutual of Omaha uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. </p>
			<p> Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your relationship with Mutual of Omaha. We take seriously the trust you place in us and will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. </p>
			<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
			<p> Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“non-personal information”) is information that does not identify you as an individual, such as your browser type, IP Address, the URL of the previous web site you visited, etc. Mutual of Omaha may automatically collect certain types of non-personal information from you when using Mutual of Omaha.com. We may also collect non-personal information that you voluntarily provide, such as information included in response to a questionnaire or survey. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> Mutual of Omaha’s primary purpose in collecting personal information on Mutual of Omaha.com is to provide you with a safe and efficient experience and to provide you with services and features that better meet your needs or requests.

			<p> Mutual of Omaha collects data when you provide information to us or through the use of web technology. </p>
			<h4>Information Collected Through You</h4>
			<p> If you choose to use certain services on Mutual of Omaha.com, we may require you to provide contact and identity information.

			<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Technology</h4>
			<h4>Cookies:</h4>
			<p> Mutual of Omaha.com may use cookie technology to improve your experience on Mutual of Omaha.com and gather data for web site statistical reporting. Cookie technology does not capture your individual email address or any personal information about you. </p>
			<p> A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on Mutual of Omaha.com home page) and gathers web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the Internet provider’s domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before and after coming to Mutual of Omaha.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate. </p>
			<p> To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) </p>
			<h4>IP Address:</h4>
			<p> Mutual of Omaha.com may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to Mutual of Omaha.com). When you visit a particular web page on Mutual of Omaha.com, our servers log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. </p>

		<li>
			<p> We take seriously the trust you place in us and will not sell, rent or lease your information to others. </p>
			<p> Mutual of Omaha and their affiliate companies employ other brokers and individuals (“agents”) to perform services on behalf of Mutual of Omaha.com.
