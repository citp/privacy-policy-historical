				<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

					Mutual of Omaha.com may use cookie technology to improve your experience on Mutual of Omaha.com and gather data for web site statistical reporting. Cookie technology does not capture your individual email address or any personal information about you.
				</p>
				<p>
					A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on Mutual of Omaha.com home page) and gathers web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the Internet provider’s domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before and after coming to Mutual of Omaha.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate.
				</p>
				<p>
					To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

					Mutual of Omaha.com may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to Mutual of Omaha.com). When you visit a particular web page on Mutual of Omaha.com, our servers log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet.
