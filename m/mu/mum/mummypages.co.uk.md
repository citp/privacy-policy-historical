However, in certain circumstances, these rights may be restricted (Article 23 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which is transposed into Irish law by section 54 of the Data Protection Act 2018, sets out the circumstances in which your rights may be restricted).  In particular, your rights may be restricted where this is necessary: (i) for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, and/or (ii) in contemplation of or for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim or legal proceedings (whether before a court, tribunal, statutory body or an administrative or out-of-court procedure).

13.2 Subject to the above, your rights under Data Protection Legislation may include (as relevant): 

Your Right: Right of Access

• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to have access to your personal data which we hold (this is more commonly known as submitting a “data subject access request”).

• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.

• Conditions to exercise? We must be able to verify your identity. Your request may not affect the rights and freedoms of others, e.g. privacy and confidentiality rights of other individuals and/or businesses.

Your Right: Right of Data Portability

• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to receive the data which you have provided to us and which is processed by us by automated means, in a commonly-used machine readable format.

• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.  If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.

• Conditions to exercise? The GDPR does not establish a general right to data portability. This right only applies if the processing is based on your consent or on our contract with you and when the processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. not for paper records). It affects only personal data that was “provided” by you. Therefore, it does not, as a rule, apply to personal data that was created by the Sheology or supplied to the Sheology by any other individual and/or business.

Your Right: Rights in relation to inaccurate personal or incomplete data

• What does it mean? You may challenge the accuracy or completeness of personal data which we process about you. If it is found that personal data is inaccurate, you are entitled to have the inaccurate data removed, corrected or completed, as appropriate.

• How do I execute this right? We encourage you to notify us of any changes regarding your personal data as soon as they occur, including changes to your contact details. Please always check first whether self-help tools are available. Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland. 

• Conditions to exercise? This right only applies to your own personal data. When exercising this right, please be as specific as possible.

Your Right: Right to object to or restrict our data processing

• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you have the right to object to or ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data.

• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland. 

• Conditions to exercise? This right applies only if the processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (see “basis of processing” above). Objections must be based on grounds relating to your particular situation. They must not be generic so that we can demonstrate that there are still lawful grounds for us to process your personal data.

Your Right: Right to have personal data erased

• What does it mean? Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled, on certain grounds, to have your personal data erased (also known as the “right to be forgotten”), e.g. where you think that the information we are processing is inaccurate, or the processing is unlawful.

• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland. 

• Conditions to exercise? There are various lawful reasons why we may not be in a position to erase your personal data. This may apply (i) where we have to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) in case of bringing legal proceedings or defending legal proceedings, or (iii) where retention periods apply by law or under the Sheology’s internal data retention policies.

Your Right: Right to withdrawal

• What does it mean? You have the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent.

• How do I execute this right? Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email data.protection@sheologydigital.com and/or by post to Sheology Data Controller, Sheology, 51 Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18, Ireland.

Accordingly, our Privacy Statement will apply to our treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies and trackers.

What are cookies?

A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer) which collects information, including personal information about you. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of websites. For example, a cookie could allow the Site to recognise your browser/login details, while another could store your preferences and other information and let you navigate the Site effectively. Cookies can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

Statistical and analytical information from cookies and trackers provides us with general and not individually specific information about the number of people who visit this Site; the number of people who return to this Site; the pages that they visit; where they were before they came to this Site and the page in the Site at which they exited. This information helps us monitor traffic on our Site so that we can manage the Site's capacity and efficiency. It also helps us to understand which parts of this Site are most popular, and generally to assess user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Site.

We may partner with or receive services from third parties which you can visit from our Site. We may also embed external content and features from such third parties within our Site (e.g. social media networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter). We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy statements and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

CHANGES TO OUR COOKIE POLICY

We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Cookie Policy, we will let you know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Site or by sending you an email.

It is important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Cookies Policy, then we cannot continue to provide the Site to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Site.

TYPES OF COOKIES

We may place our cookies on your device via our website. Our Privacy Statement will apply to how we treat the information we collect through cookies. The following are the main types of cookies used on the Site:

ESSENTIAL COOKIES

These cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, filling in forms or serving contextual ads. The types of essential cookies used are:

GDPR Consent Cookie

A simple cookie to track whether you have reviewed and consented to the latest version of our privacy policies

Registration cookies

When you register with our Site, we generate cookies that signal whether you are signed in or not. Our servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access to a particular service. It also allows us to associate any comments you post with your username. While you are signed into this Site, we combine information from your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have seen on our Site.

This website currently includes the use of the following first party cookies:

PHPSESSID – this identifies a user's session and allows them to provide relevant content through browsing experience. Also, it is required for login. Disabling it will prevent some functions from working properly, and login will not work.

remember_me – this remembers if a user has requested automatic login next time they visit the website. Disabling it will make automatic login impossible.

attention-closed, digest_closed and others - required to remember closed dialogs, like newsletter subscription, etc. Disabling them will make dialogs appear again.

In addition, this website uses Google Analytics (_ga), Facebook (fb) and certain third party cookies that are set by third parties we use for different services (for example, website analytics or advertising). These cookies are required to distinguish you from other users of our website, and help us to provide you with a good user experience when you browse our website, while also allowing us to improve our site. 

BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING COOKIES

These cookies may be set through our site and other sites you visit around the web by third-party advertisers. They may be used by those third parties to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts here and on other sites across the web. These profiles are based on identifying your IP address, browser or internet device.

We create anonymous audience segments based on interactions with our Site which can be tied back to a single cookie or device ID. We use cookie technologies provided by Google DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) to assist us in creating these audience segments. We have no possibility of linking any anonymous user of our Site who may be classified into an audience segment to an individual identifiable person.

We facilitate third parties to serve advertisements through our Site. Advertisers try to make these ads relevant to you by tracking the topics you are interested in and other ads that you like to engage with across the web. Most of these third parties participate in the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Transparency and Consent Framework, which means that you can in one place manage your privacy settings around behavioural advertising. Google DoubleClick for Publishers is our primary ad serving partner and Google provides its own mechanism for controlling how ads are personalised to you.

Manage your consent for advertisers participating in the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) framework and Google ad settings in Privacy Settings below.

The expiry date for the IAB Advertising Framework Cookie is 6 months.

Google anonymize IP addresses in logs by removing part of the address after 9 months. After 18 months, they further anonymize log data by anonymizing or deleting cookie or advertising ID information in both logs and ad serving databases.

User data tied to cookies and advertising IDs is also used to detect and prevent ad fraud and ensure that users don’t see ads that they’ve blocked in the past. In these cases, or in cases where Google stores this data on behalf of its customers (e.g. in Google Analytics), data may be stored for periods longer than those specified above.
