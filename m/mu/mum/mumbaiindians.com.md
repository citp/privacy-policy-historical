The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.

We do not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
