Your permission will be requested when you submit your information. muvee shares customer information across muvee-owned business entities and companies working on our behalf, but only as described above in “How we use your information.” 

muvee contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions described in “How we use your information.” Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of muvee and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for muvee. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers. muvee will not share personal information with any other third parties without your permission, unless required by law enforcement action, subpoena, or local law. 

muvee or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets could be acquired. If such a combination or acquisition occurs, muvee will make every reasonable effort to notify you in the event we share with the merging or acquiring entity some or all of your personal information to continue serving you.

8\. Your information and third-party companies 

Certain muvee services are linked with those from unrelated third-party companies, some of which offer you the option to share with both muvee and the third party personal data you provide. Examples include the ability to register software products from multiple vendors from a single muvee Web page, to request communications from muvee marketing or solution partners, or to enable order completion through a reseller.

10\. Keeping your information secure

muvee is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, muvee has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 

muvee and its online transaction partner use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, our online transaction partner uses fraud management techniques. This service gives you and muvee an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud to protect your financial data. 

  
11\. Changes to this Statement

If there are updates to the terms of the muvee Online Privacy Statement, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have. For material changes to this Statement, muvee will provide notification to affected customers.
