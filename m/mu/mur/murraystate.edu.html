<h1 align="center" class="style8">Information Technology Privacy Policy </h1>

<h2>1.0 Purpose</h2>
<p class="style12">Murray State University provides numerous information
technology resources for the benefit of all members of the university
community.&nbsp; These resources include frequently accessed programs such as
web sites, email, course management systems, and online payment systems as well
as computer systems such as myGate which may be more specialized in their use
and application.&nbsp; Members of the public, too, may visit and search MSU web
pages and utilize tools which appear there.&nbsp; The University also provides
network and internet access thru the Campus and ResNet networks to members of
the campus community.&nbsp; Of course, MSU also provides numerous computers for
use with work and study as well as the basic infrastructure and architecture
which enables the system to operate.</p>

<p class="style12">All of these resources enable users to communicate with each
other, the University, and others off campus; to transact various matters of
business; and to gain access to a vast amount of data with greatly increased
ease and efficiency.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="style12">MSU has established this policy so that users are aware of
the privacy which surrounds their use of technology resources and the
information and communications they send and which are received by, and which
are stored in, such means. </p>

<p class="style12">If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or
your information, please contact Information Systems at 809-2155.</p>

<h2>2.0 Scope</h2>
<p class="style12">This policy applies to all users of university information
technology resources, which is defined as all information technology/network
equipment, facilities, and services made available to users by Murray State
University, and the data stored thereon.&nbsp; The term information technology
resources encompasses all university owned and operated computers, software,
hardware, and infrastructure.&nbsp; It further includes all university services
and programs such as email, online payment, and MSU web pages.&nbsp; It also
includes:&nbsp; </p>
<ol class="style12">
  <li>Data
    and other files, including electronic mail, stored in or located or residing on
    (temporarily or otherwise) university-owned centrally-maintained systems,
    departmentally-maintained systems, and university-owned systems or computers. </li>
  <li>University
    data and other files stored off campus in systems owned or operated by other
    entities. These systems may be subject to their own terms and conditions related
    to privacy and other matters.</li>
  <li>Data communicated over Campus and ResNet
    networks.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Telecommunications
    (voice or data) traffic from, to, or between any devices described above
    including voicemail. </li>
</ol>

<p class="style12">As used in this Information Technology Privacy Policy, “you” and “user” both refer
  to any individual -- whether student, faculty, staff, or individual external to
  MSU -- who uses MSU information technology resources. </p>

<h2>3.0 Policy</h2>
<h2 class="style9">3.1 What Information is Available from MSU’s Technology Resources</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 Information You Knowingly Provide</h3>
<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">You may communicate via Murray
State’s information technology resources for many reasons. You may send an
email to the Bursar’s Office, Human Resources, a work colleague, or a friend;
forward a draft document to a co-worker; submit a class assignment to a
professor electronically; or apply for admission to the University via an
online form.&nbsp; Thus, depending upon the nature of any communication the
information transmitted and available through information technology resources
could include personally identifiable information such as name, telephone
numbers, date of birth, permanent addresses, social security number, employment
or class information, etc.&nbsp; Information requested by MSU in forms or
applications is needed so MSU can provide the service you need or
request.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>3.1.2 Information You May Not Realize You Provide</h3>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">In addition to the kinds of
information referenced above, information may be transmitted and recorded
(whether you realize it or not) anytime you use Murray State’s technology
resources including simply visiting a Murray State University web site. This
information includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet address of the computer being used</li>
  <li>The web pages requested or viewed</li>
  <li>The network software accessed</li>
  <li>The web page which referred the user to any MSU web page</li>
  <li>The internet browser used</li>
  <li>The date, time, and duration of the activity</li>
  <li>The accounts accessed</li>
  <li>The volume of data stored and transferred</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.3 Documents and files</h3>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">You may use MSU’s information
technology resources to create files, documents, or other compilations of data
or information. These items may not be sent to anyone, but may simply be
created on a MSU computer at a work station or in a computer laboratory and
could remain there without you intentionally saving them on the computer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">MSU’s information resources are
used to create, store, and manage files or documents about employees, students,
alumni, contractors, and others.&nbsp; These documents can contain personally
identifiable information including name, address, date of birth, social
security number, gender, race, grades, and other personal information, as well
as financial information such as salary, banking information, and payroll
deductions. &nbsp;Such information and the compilation of such information are
necessary in order to carry on the regular operations of an institution of
higher education.</p>

<h3>3.1.4 Cookies</h3>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">Cookies are a technology which can
be used to provide you with tailored information from a web site. A cookie is
an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then
store it on your system.&nbsp; It can then be read back later by the web site when
required. The use of cookies is a convenient way of allowing a computer to
remember specific information relating to a web site.&nbsp; You can set your browser
to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide
whether to accept it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">MSU’s systems make use of cookies
for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Site administration</li>
  <li>Completing the user's current activity</li>
  <li>User Targeting</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.5 Information from On-Line Payments</h3>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">It is possible to make on-line
payments at MSU with debit and credit cards and e-checks.&nbsp; In some instances,
the user making the payment is directed to a third party website in order to
make payment. The third party sites may have their own privacy policies.&nbsp; In
other instances, on-line payments result in the storage of information on MSU
servers.&nbsp; </p>

<h3 class="style12">3.1.6 E-Mail</h3>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">Emails sent or received using MSU’s information technology resources or sent from or to any email address provided by MSU (eg. astudent1@murraystate.edu or astudent1@coe.murraystate.edu) are subject to monitoring and access by MSU.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="style12" style="margin-left:.25in;">MSU may utilize an outside
e-mail/service provider. In the event MSU utilizes an outside e-mail/service
provider, MSU will maintain on its own servers copies of all e-mail sent or
received through that e-mail/service provider; this email will be subject to
this Information Technology Privacy Policy. The e-mail/service provider will also monitor and have
access to the accounts which it provides. MSU will also have access to emails
and other documents/transmissions in those accounts maintained by the provider.
The provider will have its own privacy policies.</p>

<h2 class="style10">3.2 Who Has Access to Information Available From MSU’s Information
Technology Resources?</h2>

<h3>3.2.1 MSU Employees</h3>
<ol style="margin-left:1in;">
  <li>To
    provide services</li>

  <ul>
    <li>As noted above, information technology resources are used to
      communicate with the University and its staff and faculty for many different
      reasons.&nbsp; Requests for services and information from and submissions to
      the University are reviewed by the appropriate MSU employee.&nbsp; Depending
      upon the nature of the user’s transmittal, the communication may be reviewed by
      more than one employee in order to provide the needed service. These employees will only use this data for work related
      purposes, which may include sharing it with appropriate individuals outside
      MSU, and as otherwise allowed here.</li>
    <li>In the course of their normal job
      duties and the operation of the University, authorized employees will have
      access to data, including stored data, about you. This data may not have been
      communicated directly to those employees by you, but appropriate employees will
      have access as a regular part of their employment. They will only use this data for work related purposes, which
      may include sharing it with appropriate individuals outside MSU, and as
      otherwise allowed here.</li>
  </ul>

<li>
Monitoring and Access</li>

  <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
    <li>MSU, as a regular part of its business, monitors its information
      technology resources in an effort to ensure they are used in accordance with
      law and university policy, that they are operating efficiently, that there are
      no threats to them, and that they are regularly maintained and up-dated.&nbsp; This
      regular monitoring may result in MSU’s accessing information technology
      resources you use including email and communications you send or receive,
      viewing or scanning files or software you have placed on MSU’s information
      technology resources, and retrieving, copying, and distributing information
      found.&nbsp; Appropriate action will be taken if this regular monitoring reveals
      violations of law or any university policy.</li>
    <li>MSU may as a regular part of its business also monitor and access
      the information technology resources you use.&nbsp; This includes email and
      communications you send or receive or files or software you have placed on
      MSU’s information technology resources. MSU may&nbsp; retrieve, copy, and distribute
      information found if such actions are taken by an employee as a regular and
      necessary part of his/her job duties, or if such actions are determined to be
      in the best interests of MSU by the Chief Information Officer or higher level
      of university management.&nbsp; This may occur, for example, in the event there are
      reasonable grounds to believe:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a threat to the University’s information technology
        resources, or if such access is needed to ensure the efficient operations of
        any MSU information technology resources </li>
      <li>That a violation of university policy or an illegal act has
        occurred or may occur </li>
      <li>There is a threat to university property or the rights of the
        University</li>
      <li>There is an emergency affecting the safety of persons or property</li>
      <li>Access is needed in order for MSU to conduct its regular business
        affairs efficiently</li>
      <li>Litigation involving the University or its agents or employees is
        possible or on-going.</li>
      <li>A work document, to which a department needs access, is on an
        employee’s computer but the employee is absent.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>MSU’s monitoring and access may occur without notice to you. The
      fact that any information technology resource is password protected will not
      prevent monitoring and access by MSU. Monitoring and access may include
      physically accessing information resources wherever located.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h3>3.2.2 Disclosure of information to individuals outside of MSU</h3>
<ol style="margin-left:1in;">
<li>MSU
may initiate disclosure of information from its information technology
resources to persons or entities inside or outside the University if needed in
order for MSU to carry on its activities as an institution of higher education
or if otherwise consistent with law. MSU employees may need to share
information with other agencies in order to implement programs provided at MSU
or to assist with a particular request. MSU will advise law enforcement
officials, including the University’s Department of Public Safety and Emergency
Management, if the regular monitoring of its information technology resources
uncovers activity which may be criminal in nature such as downloading child
pornography or communications of an illegal nature.</li>

<li> Requests
for information from persons or entities outside the University.&nbsp;
The following considerations are relevant in the event MSU receives a request
from a person or entity outside the University for information, including
personally identifiable information, available from its information technology
resources.

  <ul>
    <li>FERPA.&nbsp; In general, personally identifiable information in
      records maintained by or for MSU which directly relates to a student may be
      disclosed only as allowed by the provisions of the Family Educational Rights
      and Privacy Act (FERPA).&nbsp; The University’s current FERPA policy, including
      the provision by which students can prevent disclosure of certain “directory
      information,” can be found at <a href="http://www.murraystate.edu/Academics/RegistrarsOffice/FERPAPrivacyAct.aspx">http://www.murraystate.edu/Academics/RegistrarsOffice/FERPAPrivacyAct.aspx</a>
<br>

In addition to what is stated in the policy, FERPA recognizes that
  information in student records can under certain circumstances be shared with
  individuals outside MSU even if a student does not consent.    </li>
    <li>Kentucky Open Records Act
      <ul>
        <li>Because MSU is a public agency, it is subject to the provisions
          of the Kentucky Open Records Act.&nbsp; These statutes require the release of
          certain records the University maintains, including electronic records, if a
          proper request is made.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Not all records, however, are subject to release.&nbsp; The open
          records act exempts from disclosure, for example, information of a “personal
          nature” contained in a record maintained by the University.&nbsp; Thus, MSU
          does not provide an employee’s social security number or bank account
          information even if a proper open records request regarding the employee is
          made.&nbsp; Information otherwise protected from disclosure by FERPA will not
          be disclosed in response to a request under the Open Records Act.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Employee users of MSU’s email system are advised that their
          private and business email communications may be subject to the Open Records Act.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Other considerations
      <ul>
        <li>Release of information found within MSU’s information technology
          resources may be required if it is the subject of legal process, such as a
          subpoena, or is requested by an agency with proper jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>MSU may be required to produce information stored within its
          information technology resources in the event of litigation.&nbsp; In addition,
          MSU reserves the right to collect and release any information regarding or
          created by any user in the event MSU and the user are involved in litigation
          including any administrative or internal proceedings. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="style10">3.3 Security of information</h2>

<p class="style12">Murray State utilizes appropriate and reasonable measures to
protect the security of its information technology resources. It cannot,
however, guarantee absolute security for information.</p>

<p class="style12">MSU has no control over the privacy of information you share
on any pages or sites outside of the murraystate.edu domain even if they are
accessed through or linked to MSU information technology resources. Similarly,
MSU cannot guarantee security of data once it is released to a third party.</p>

<h2>4.0 Review and Modification </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Proposals
    for amendments to this policy will be forwarded to the Chief Information
    Officer. The proposals and comments will be brought before the ITAC Policy Review
    Subcommittee by the Chief Information Officer.</li>
  <li> Any
    amendments to this policy will be approved by the President of the University.
    All new or amended policies will become effective as soon as Presidential
    approval is obtained and they have been published on the Policy website.</li>
</ol>

<h2>5.0 Penalty</h2>
<p class="style12">Any employee found to have
violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.</p>

<h2>6.0 Acceptance/Consent</h2>
<p class="style11">Signature on an account application form, acceptance of a
user ID, online registration, or use of any information technology resource
denotes that the applicant/user has read and understands, accepts and consents
to this Information Technology Privacy Policy.</p>
