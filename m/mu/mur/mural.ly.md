# Privacy Policy - MURAL

This Privacy Policy describes how MURAL collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

Updates in this version of the Privacy Policy reflect changes in data protection law. In addition, we have worked to make the Privacy Policy clearer and more understandable.

### Applicability Of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to MURAL’s online tools and platform, including the associated MURAL mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the " **Services** "), Mural.co (the " **Website** ")and other interactions (e.g.,customer service inquiries,etc.) you may have with MURAL. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, website or any other aspect ofMURAL’sbusiness.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrates with the Services through theMURAL platform (" **Third Party Services** "), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governsdelivery, access and use of the Services(the " **Customer Agreement** "), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively," **Customer Data** "). The organization (e.g.,your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (" **Customer** ") controls their instance of the Services (their " **Workspace** ") and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check with your workspacea dministrator(s) for contact information. If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance fromthe Customer that sent the invitation.

### Information We Collect And Receive

MURAL may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (" **Other Information** ") in a variety of ways:

  * **Customer Data**. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (" **Authorized Users** ") routinely submit Customer Data to MURAL when using the Services.
  * **Other Information.MURAL** also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:



Workspace and Account Information. To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply MURAL with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. your first name, last name, email address, and company name (if applicable).

MURAL will collect billing and payment information which may include your credit card number, billing address, and other payment related information (" **Billing Information** "). Billing Information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processor operating as our agent. MURAL does not directly obtain or process any Billing Information.

  1. Usage Information.

    * _Services Metadata,_. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work. For example, the amount of times a user entered a mural, to get statistical information about the product features.

    * _Log data_. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.

    * _Device information_. MURAL collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.

    * _Location information_. We receive information from i, your Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. MURAL may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.

  2. Cookie Information. MURALuses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Website and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://mural.co/terms/cookie-policy/).

  3. Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with MURAL. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to MURALto facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to MURAL. When a Third Party Service is enabled, MURAL is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to MURALin accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. For example, you may choose to sign-in using your Google, or your company identity provider account. By signing-in using your Third Party account, the Third Party will supply MURAL any and all information that you have authorized the Third Party to provide to us. Such information may include your first and last name, unique identifier, e-mail address and picture. If you would like to know more about 3rd parties or any other information about them, you can write an email to [compliance@mural.co](mailto:compliance@mural.co).

  4. Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import is collected when using the Services.

  5. Third Party Data. MURAL may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.

  6. Additional Information Provided to Mural. We receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in an activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with MURAL.




Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, " **Information** "). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services .

### How We Use Information

Customer Data will be used by MURAL in accordance with Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. MURAL is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.

MURAL uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Websites and business. More specifically, MURAL uses Other Information:

  * **To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and business**. This includes use of Other Information to support delivery of the Services under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an Authorized User’s request.

  * **As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.**

  * **To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features**. MURAL tries to make the Services as useful as possible for specific Workspaces and Authorized Users. For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to an Authorized User, make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize a Services experience or create new productivity features and products.

  * **To send emails and other communications**.We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about MURAL. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.

  * **For billing, account management and other administrative matters**.MURAL may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.

  * **To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse**.




If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, MURAL may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as " **Personal Data**."

### Data Retention

MURAL will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. Customer may also apply different settings to messages, files or other types of Customer Data. The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Other Information. For more detail, please contact Customer. MURAL may retain Other Information pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Other Information after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for MURAL to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

### How We Share And Disclose Information

This section describes how MURAL may share and disclose Information. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information, and MURAL does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.

  * **Customer’s Instructions**.MURAL will solely share and disclose Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and in compliance with applicable law and legal process.

  * **Displaying the Services.** When an Authorized User submits Other Information, it may be displayed to other Authorized Users in the same or connected Workspaces. For example, an Authorized User’s email address may be displayed with their Workspace profile. Please consult [support@mural.co](mailto:support@mural.co) for more information on Services functionality.

  * **Collaborating with Others**.The Services provide different ways for Authorized Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate. Other Information, such as an Authorized User’s profile Information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the other Workspace(s).

  * **Third Party Service Providers and Partners**. We may engage third party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process Other Information and support our business. These third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage services.

  * **Third Party Services**.Customer may enable or permit Authorized Users to enable Third Party Services. When enabled, Mural may share Other Information with Third Party Services. Third Party Services are not owned or controlled by Mural and third parties that have been granted access to Other Information may have their own policies and practices for its collection and use. Please check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services or contact the provider for any questions at [compliance@mural.co](mailto:compliance@mural.co)

  * **Corporate Affiliates**.MURAL may share Other Information with its corporate affiliates, parents and/or subsidiaries.

  * During a Change to Mural’s Business.If MURAL engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of Mural’s assets or stock, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g. due diligence), some or all Other Information may be shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.

  * **Aggregated or De-identified Data.** We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified Other Information for any purpose. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified Other Information with prospects or partners for business or research purposes, such as telling a prospective Mural customer the average amount of time spent within a typical Workspace.

  * **To Comply with Laws.** If we receive a request for information, we may disclose Other Information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process. Except as expressly permitted by the Contract or in cases of emergency to avoid death or physical harm to individuals, MURALwill only disclose Customer Data in response to valid and binding compulsory legal process. MURALrequires a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (a federal court or a court of general criminal jurisdiction of a State authorized by the law of that State to issue search warrants) to disclose Customer Data. All requests by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation for Customer Data disclosures should be sent to [compliance@mural.co](mailto:compliance@mural.co). Requests should be prepared and served in accordance with applicable law. All requests should be narrow and focused on the specific Customer Data sought. All requests will be construed narrowly by MURAL, so please do not submit unnecessarily broad requests. MURALwill notify Customer before disclosing any of Customer’s Customer Data so that the Customer may seek protection from such disclosure, unless MURALis prohibited from doing so or there is a clear indication of illegal conduct or risk of harm to people or property associated with the use of such Customer Data. If MURALis legally prohibited from notifying Customer prior to disclosure, MURALwill take reasonable steps to notify Customer of the demand after the nondisclosure requirement expires. In case of international requests, MURALrequires that any individual issuing legal process or legal information requests (e.g., discovery requests, warrants, or subpoenas) to MURALproperly domesticate the process or request and serve MURALin a jurisdiction where it is resident or has a registered agent to accept service on its behalf. MURAL does not accept legal process or requests directly from law enforcement entities outside the U.S. Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a court where Mural is located.

  * **To enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety.** To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of MURAL or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.

  * **With Consent.** MURAL may share Other Information with third parties when we have consent to do so.
