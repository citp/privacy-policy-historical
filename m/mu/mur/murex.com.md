For instance, only the members of the Human Resources department and other relevant departments of Murex involved in a recruitment process may access the personal data you decide to supply on the Websites when submitting a job application to Murex.

**Service providers:** From time to time, in order to provide you with our Services, we may work with subcontractors who provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, infrastructure, and analysis or other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.
