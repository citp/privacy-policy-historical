# PR Newswire Privacy Policy

PR Newswire is the global leader in news and information distribution services for professional communicators. As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "PR Newswire", “we” and “us” refer to PR Newswire Association LLC and its divisions and affiliates, including MultiVu, Vintage and Virtual Press Office, Inc.

PR Newswire is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our Websites, and other online products and services collectively as the "Services." The term "Services" also includes any surveys, newsletters, webinars, contests, blogs and promotions that you may subscribe to or participate in through our Websites, and any white papers, articles, infographics, case studies, videos or other content created by or on behalf of PR Newswire that you download.

In addition to information obtained through your use of the Services, this Privacy Policy also applies to information that we obtain when you register for, purchase or otherwise communicate with us about the Services, including by e-mail, telephone and otherwise. Certain of our Services may be available via mobile app. This privacy policy governs the collection and use of data about you and your use of any PR Newswire mobile app. (Although, we may provide additional notice and choice options within the app itself.)

Note to Journalists, Experts and PR Professionals: News and journalism are public activities. Your name, business contact details, and professional interests and affiliations may already be publicly available, particularly if you are a journalist, a recognized expert, or a PR professional. We have created this Privacy Policy because we recognize that, even in a business context, you may have a need and expectation that your identity and interests be kept anonymous or private in certain circumstances. We want to be clear about when and how we protect that expectation.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we will treat your information before you start to use our Services or communicate with us about them.

By using our services or communicating with us about them, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this privacy policy, including any updates and amendments. if you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy, you must not access or use our services or communicate with us about them.

Our Services may also, from time to time, contain links to and from social media platforms. You may choose to connect to us through a social media platform and when you do, and to the extent available, we may collect additional information from you, such as your screen names, profile picture, contact information, contact list, and the profile pictures of your contacts, through the social media platform. Please be advised that social media platforms may also collect information from you. We do not have control over the collection, use and sharing practices of social media platforms and encourage you to review their usage and disclosure policies and practices, including the data security practices, before using the social media platforms.

We may supplement the technical information we collect from you with information collected by third parties. Third parties may include advertising partners or other providers that help us understand our users and provide better service to our users.

On occasion, we may combine data collected from other third party sources and add it to the information you or your company or organization has provided. We may also compile your contact data from other sources to contact you if we think you or the company you represent would be interested in our Services.

Third parties unaffiliated with us may also collect information about you, including tracking your browsing history, when you use our Services. We do not have control over these third party collection practices and advise you to adjust the settings of your browsers or install plug-ins and add-ins if you wish to minimize these third party collections.

We may share information, including Personally Identifiable Information, with our service providers and agents to the extent reasonably necessary to provide our Services to you. For example, we use a third party platform for e-mail and cannot communicate with you without disclosing your e-mail address to our third party e-mail provider. These third parties use any information we share only to support us and our efforts to provide our Services.

We may share any information, including Personally Identifiable Information with:

  * Our subsidiaries and affiliates
  * Our service providers and sub-contractors to the extent reasonably necessary to enable us provide our Services;
  * A buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Personally Identifiable Information held by us about our users is among the assets transferred;
  * A third party with whom we must legally share information about you;
  * You, upon your request;

  * For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.



We may share non-Personally Identifiable Information, aggregate or anonymous data:

  * With analytics, search engine, or other service providers that help us improve our Services;

We may use cookies, beacons and similar technologies, now or in the future, to support the functionality of our Services. This provides a better experience when you visit our Websites and allows us to improve our Services.

  * Browser Cookies. A browser cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. That cookie then communicates with servers, ours or those of other companies that we authorize to collect data for us, and allows recognition of your personal computer. We associate cookies with Personally Identifiable Information only if you use the automatic recognition capabilities on restricted areas of the Websites, order a Service, use the personalization services available as part of the Websites, or ask us to contact you with additional marketing information. Otherwise, we do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from browser cookies and we do not associate browser cookies with your Personally Identifiable Information.   
You may use the tools available on your computer or other device to set your browser to refuse or disable all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you refuse or disable all browser cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites or use certain features or functionality of our Services.   
You may choose whether to activate automatic recognition when you register for a Service, or after registration, you may disable the persistent cookie that supports recognition using the tools in your browser. If you choose to disable the cookies that support automatic recognition, you will need to re-enter your user ID and password each time you access a gated portion of the website.   
Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it refuses all cookies, we may issue cookies when you direct your browser to use our Services. 
  * Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Services may use local stored objects called flash cookies to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Websites. We also include cookies in our third party hosted video players to count the number of unique viewers who see a customer’s video press release and to provide aggregate reporting. The cookies do not identify you as an individual or track your online behavior. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from flash cookies and we will not associate them with your Personally Identifiable Information.   
Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's website. If you disable or refuse Flash cookies, please note that some parts of our Services may be inaccessible or may not function properly.


  * Web Beacons. Our Websites and e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear GIFs, pixel tags and single-pixel GIFs) that permit us to, for example, count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other website-related statistics. Web beacons in e-mail marketing campaigns allow us to track your responses and your interests in our content, offerings and web pages. You may use the tools in your device to disable these technologies as well.



****_**Your Choices**_

Please note that we cannot control how third party websites or online services you visit through our Services respond to Do Not Track signals. Check the privacy policies of those third parties for information on their privacy practices.
