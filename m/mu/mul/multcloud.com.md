# Privacy Policy

We at MultCloud understand your concern about how we share, secure and use the information you have shared with us when you visit the website [multcloud.com](https://www.multcloud.com/) (our “Website”) and use our services. Our Privacy Policy makes it clear how that information is handled at our end, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information. We adhere to what we say in this Privacy Policy. 

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you can choose not to use our Website. By accessing or using our Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates. 

**Notes:** After authorization, MultCloud accesses the data in the user's cloud drive (Google Drive, Google Photos, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) without saving the contents. All operations on the user data are based-on the API interface provided by the cloud disk. Therefore, MultCloud plays just as a bridge to connect one cloud storage to another. 

#### 01\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU

**Customer-Provided Information:** To use MultCloud services, you may first download the MultCloud application (the “App”). To download the App, you will be requested to provide certain information.

Cookies we send do not pick-up any of your personal information. MultCloud sends two types of cookies – persistent cookies (those that continue to exist in your hard drive even after closing your browser) and the session cookies (temporary cookies that get deleted after closing your browser). Persistent cookies are used by your browser for subsequent visits to MultCloud. Your web browser can be reset to reject MultCloud cookies or to alert you when a cookie is sent to the browser.

Information collected by clear gifs enables us to assess and improve marketing strategies and make MultCloud serve you in a better way.
