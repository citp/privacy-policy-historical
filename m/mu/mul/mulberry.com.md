Those social media sites will also have their own privacy policies explaining how they use and share your personal data. You should carefully review those privacy policies before you use social media sites, to make sure that you are happy with them.

## Reasons for collecting personal data

(1) Personal data you share with us

We use the personal data you share with us in order to perform our obligations under any contract we have with you, and specifically to:

  * provide you with our products and to fulfil orders that you place with us on our Website or on our App;
  * create and help you manage your Mulberry account;
  * allow you to return your Mulberry product, if you change your mind;
  * respond to your questions and requests; and
  * send you information on any changes we make to our policies or terms.



Where you have given us your consent to contact you, we will use your personal data to:

  * send you newsletters, marketing communications, products update and suggestions on how to care for your Mulberry product;
  * contact you to invite you to special events;
  * send you an invite to our sample sale if you have subscribed to it; and
  * notify you of other Mulberry products we think you might like based on your previous purchases.



You can withdraw your consent at any time.

We use our legitimate interests to enhance your customer experience and provide the best in class service; therefore we will:

  * remind you of what you may be missing if you have put items in your "Shopping Bag" on the Website or App and then abandoned them; 
  * send you surveys for feedback on our services to enhance your customer experience; and
  * keep track of your requests and interactions with our customer service, via LiveChat, telephone calls or direct email.



(2) Personal data we collect about you

We use the personal data we collect about you for our legitimate interests so that we can:

  * tailor the way that you interact with us in the future, such as tailoring certain emails and also show you certain adverts, products or offers in which we think you may be interested, both on our Website and App and on certain third party websites (including on social media);
  * analyse how our Website and App are used, so that we can constantly improve the services that we offer;
  * analyse your feedback, and understand your expectations on our products or services to optimize your customer experience;
  * record CCTV footage of our premises and visitors for the security and safety of all our staff, visitors and products; and
  * retain preferences and other personal data or information disclosed during conversations in store or over the telephone to ensure the best customer experience.



Not all of the information used for these purposes is "personal data"; some of it is anonymised or used on an aggregate basis.

(3) Personal data we receive from other sources

We use the personal data we receive from other sources for our legitimate interests so that we can develop an understanding of what people think about our products and services, so that we can constantly improve them.

If you have opted-in for marketing communications from one of our Mulberry franchise partners, this includes an opt-in for marketing communication from us. You can change your preferences at any time by contacting us on enquiries@mulberry.com, or by calling us on +44 (0) 1761 234 273, or by using the unsubscribe option in each e-mail, or via your online Mulberry account “My Mulberry”.

We may share your personal data with the following third parties:

  * other companies in the Mulberry group for operational and business reasons, and if you have agreed they can send you marketing e-mails;
  * service providers who help us to operate our Website and App, fulfil your orders and deliver our products to you; for example, credit reference agencies, couriers, payment providers, IT support and so on;
  * market research and customer survey companies to help us develop and improve your customer experience. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from disclosing or sharing this information with anyone other than Mulberry;
  * fulfilment companies to send mailing to your postal address if you have consented to receive mailings; and
  * certain regulatory bodies, government and enforcement agencies, if we need to do so or are requested to do so.



We will also share personal data collected about you with social media channels, advertising networks and other third parties who help us to understand how our Website and App are being used, how well our advertising works and how we can improve; to provide ad measurement services and to target advertising (and in some cases, we may allow those third parties to collect and receive data themselves for these purposes, which they may also collect from elsewhere on the internet and other apps). This information is collected using cookies and other similar technologies. You can find more information on what cookies and technologies are used, how they are used, and your options for changing how we use them in the section below on "Cookies" and in our Cookies Policy.

If we decide to sell or buy any parts of our business, we may also need to share your personal data with the buyer of those parts of the business. In those circumstances, we will make sure that any new buyer will promptly give you details of how they will use your personal data, and your options for changing that.

We will not sell your personal data to any third party.

## Receiving contact from Mulberry & changing contact preferences

From time to time, we will send you aftercare e-mails relating to your Mulberry product.

Where you have consented, we will also send you e-mails with information in relation to any products which are similar to your Mulberry product, and which we think you might like.

When you sign up to one of our 'waitlists' for a Mulberry product that is not yet available, we will send you an e-mail to let you know when that product becomes available, but we will not send you any any marketing communications as a result of this subscription.

We will only send you e-mails with information in relation to any other products, special offers or competitions, if you have agreed that we can (sometimes referred to as an "opt-in"). You can sign up to receive communications by e-mail, by post, by text/SMS or by telephone call about our new collections, exclusive online offers and events.

We will also only share your personal data with third parties (including companies in the Mulberry group) for them to send you marketing e-mails or communications, if you have agreed that we can send you such communications.

In any case, you can ask us to change your communications preferences or to stop contacting you at any time, by contacting us on enquiries@mulberry.com, or by calling us on +44 (0) 1761 234 273, or by using the unsubscribe option in each e-mail, or via your online Mulberry account “My Mulberry”.
