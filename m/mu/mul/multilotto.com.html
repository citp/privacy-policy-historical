			<br>
			<h2>5. SECURITY PROCEDURES</h2>
			<h3>5.1 USER PROFILE</h3>
			<p>MULTILOTTO store information that we collect through cookies, log files and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>5.2 COOKIES </h3>
			<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>5.3 LOG FILES</h3>
			<p>Like most standard Web site servers MULTILOTTO use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>5.4 SECURITY </h3>
			<p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. </p>
			<br>
			<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. </p>
			<br>
			<p>While MULTILOTTO use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only authorised MULTILOTTO employees are granted access to personally identifiable information. MULTILOTTO perform checks on all our potential employees to ensure that none of them have a criminal record. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. </p>
			<br>
			<p>When new policy is added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>5.5 DATA ENCRYPTION</h3>
			<p>To protect your personal data during communication with your web browser, the company uses secure and tested encryption technology from Thawt. Online transactions continue to be protected by the extremely reliable security system of a worldwide-accredited partner.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>5.6 OTHER </h3>
			<p>To prevent the illegal manipulation through a third person, the IP-Address of the logged-on computer will be requested and saved. </p>
			<br>
			<p>In addition, all your data is protected from unauthorised access by a so-called firewall – a computer that is fitted with complex security technology specifically designed to shield the company's network from the Internet. Additionally, the company uses reliable internal data protection mechanisms combined with a restrictive security system.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>6. DATA PROTECTION</h2>
			<p>Under applicable data protection legislation we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. MULTILOTTO use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorized access to it. </p>
			<br>
			<h2>7. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2>
			<p>In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information MULTILOTTO receive with information from third party sources. </p>
			<br>
			<h2>8. NEWSLETTERS</h2>
			<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.  Should you not wish to receive these communications you can either change your account settings or click “unsubscribe” in the bottom of the email.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>9. DISCLAIMER AS TO LIABILITY FOR UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF PERSONAL DATA </h2>
			<p>MULTILOTTO is committed to ensuring that its customers are protected in the best possible way by means of up to date security levels, however MULTILOTTO shall take no responsibility whatsoever for events beyond its control inclusive of but not limited to acts of god or natural disasters, including also power cuts and strikes.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>10. ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</h2>
			<p>Once you click ‘I Agree' you have unconditionally agreed to abide by and be bound by all clauses contained in our Privacy Policy and you will be deemed to have given your consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with the terms set out in our Privacy Policy.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Although MULTILOTTO shall inform you of any changes effected to our Privacy Policy, we strongly recommend that you check this page regularly from time to time. </p>
