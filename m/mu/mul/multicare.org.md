# Privacy Policy > MultiCare Health System

### Web Privacy Statement

MultiCare respects the privacy of visitors to this web site and is committed to making the best effort we can to safeguard your information. This statement outlines how we collect, use and protect the personal information you provide to us, and serves to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and services. Please read this entire statement to understand how your information will be treated. 

This statement only applies to the use of information about users of our web site. For information about MultiCare's general privacy policies, please see our Notice of Privacy Practices. Due to the nature of electronic communications, please understand that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (i.e. via email), we cannot and do not provide any assurances that your information will not become known or accessible to third parties. If you provide any confidential information about you or your health to us via electronic communication, it is at your own risk. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. 

### Server Log Information

MultiCare collects standard server log information such as IP address, time spent on the site, browser type, etc. We collect and assess this information on an aggregate basis in order to track site statistics, pages that are most popular to our visitors, performance monitoring and troubleshooting. We also use this information for site and system security. We do not share server log information with third parties for marketing or other purposes. 

### Registration Information

Any registration form that requires a visitor to provide us with contact information (i.e. name, address, phone number), unique identifiers (i.e. email address, social security number), financial information (i.e. account or credit card numbers), and other information (i.e. employment history, preferences, etc.) is covered in this privacy policy. Financial information that is collected is used only to bill the visitor for services and products utilized. Unique identifiers (i.e. social security numbers) are collected only for registration and educational class enrollment. Access to this information is password protected on our servers, and is accessible to only a minimal number of MultiCare employees for business use only. We do not share this information with outside parties. 

### Security

MultiCare has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. MultiCare employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions through the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with 128-bit encryption. Any connection between your web browser and an https-protected page on our site uses this level of encryption. 

### Email

Transmittal of emails to this web site may not be private. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (i.e. via email), we cannot and do not provide any assurances that your information will not become known or accessible to third parties. If you provide any confidential information about you or your health to us via electronic communication, it is at your own risk. MultiCare employs strict security measures to safeguard information, but no site has been proven to be impenetrable.
