                Multiple Stream Media has established this Privacy Policy to 
                explain how it protects and manages the personal information 
                that it collects from you (the customer, subscriber, vendor) 
                online.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure<br>
                </b><br>
                Your use of the Multiple Stream Media site and/or your 
                registration for Multiple Stream Media products and services 
                constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If 
                you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do 
                not use the Multiple Stream Media site.<br>
                <br>
                Multiple Stream Media may occasionally update this Privacy 
                Policy. When it does, Multiple Stream Media will also revise the 
                “last update” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In 
                addition, Multiple Stream Media will seek a customer's prior 
                consent, by email, for any new uses or proposed disclosures of 
                information collected from the customer prior to the change. 
                Multiple Stream Media will notify customers by email of changes 
                to this policy that will affect information collected from them 
                in the future. In certain circumstances, however, Multiple 
                Stream Media will not inform and obtain the consent of the 
                customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a 
                breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency 
                where the security, life, health of an individual is threatened, 
                the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a 
                law enforcement agency or a court order.<br>
                <br>
                A customer may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use 
                and disclosure at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe@multiplestreammktg.com. 
                Please note that, if you do, Multiple Stream Media may suspend 
                its provision of products and services to you. When you 
                unsubscribe, if you fall within the guarantee period for any 
                Multiple Stream Media product and you request a refund, the 
                guarantee will be honored.<br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Accountability<br>
                </b><br>
                Multiple Stream Media collects, at the time of your registration 
                and your sign-on to its web site, certain “personal 
                information” (information that personally identifies you) 
                including but not limited to your name, email address, home or 
                work address, telephone number, and information about your 
                computer hardware and software (e.g., IP address, operating 
                system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and 
                referring web site addresses).<br>
                <br>
                Multiple Stream Media has implemented this Privacy Policy to 
                protect personal information received from its customers, and to 
                respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that 
                Multiple Stream Media will use appropriate contractual means to 
                establish a comparable level of protection for personal 
                information which is sent for processing by third parties on 
                Multiple Stream Media's behalf.<br>
                <br>
                Multiple Stream Media has designated responsibility for your 
                personal information to its Privacy Officer, who ensures 
                compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy. Other 
                Multiple Stream Media individuals may be delegated to act on 
                behalf of the Privacy Officer.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information<br>
                </b><br>
                Multiple Stream Media collects and uses personal information for 
                the following Identified Purposes:<br>

                necessary, and to inform customers of upgrades, as well as of 
                other products and services available from Multiple Stream 
                Media, its affiliates and third parties;<br>
                <br>
                (e) to allow customers to access limited-entry areas of Multiple 
                Stream Media's site;<br>
                <br>
                (f) to personalize some of our services and products for you and

                or government request;<br>
                <br>
                (i) to respond to a legitimate claim, or to address our 
                reasonable belief, that you are violating the rights of any 
                third party or any of the agreements or policies that govern 
                your use of the Multiple Stream Media site or any Multiple 
                Stream Media product or service;<br>
                <br>
                (j) to protect the services, products or rights of Multiple 
                Stream Media, including but not limited to the security or 
                integrity of the Multiple Stream Media site; and<br>
                <br>
                (k) to identify and resolve technical problems concerning 
                Multiple Stream Media's site, products and services.<br>
                <br>
                Multiple Stream Media also uses personal information in an 
                aggregate form (i.e., not individually attributable to you) for 
                its business analysis, operational, marketing and other 
                promotional purposes.<br>
                <br>
                If we hire other companies to provide some products or services 
                on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the 
                personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and 
                we will limit their rights to use and further disclose your 
                personal information as appropriate in the course of their work 
                for us.<br>
                <br>
                <b>4. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information<br>
                </b><br>
                Multiple Stream Media limits its collection of personal 
                information to only that information which is necessary for the 
                Identified Purposes. Multiple Stream Media does not direct its 
                site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information 
                from children under the age of thirteen.<br>
                <br>
                When you visit the Multiple Stream Media web site, a cookie may 
                be placed on your computer or the cookie may be read if you have 
                visited the Multiple Stream Media site previously. Multiple

                determine which products and services you have already purchased 
                so that Multiple Stream Media does not provide redundant 
                information to you, and, if you are an Multiple Stream Media 
                affiliate, to track Multiple Stream Media sales made to 
                customers referred by you so that you can receive compensation 
                under our affiliate program. If you choose to not have your

                <b>5. Disclosure, Processing and Retention<br>
                </b><br>
                Multiple Stream Media does not sell, rent or disclose your 
                personal information to anyone else, except:<br>
                <br>
                (a) to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one 
                or more of the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 2, above);<br>
                <br>
                (b) to Multiple Stream Media's employees, independent 
                contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business 
                associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on 
                Multiple Stream Media's behalf for any of the Identified 
                Purposes;<br>
                <br>
                (c) as necessary if Multiple Stream Media has reason to believe 
                that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal 
                action against someone who may be causing injury to or 
                interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with 
                Multiple Stream Media's rights or property, other users of 
                Multiple Stream Media's web site, products or services, or 
                anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and<br>
                <br>
                (d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to 
                law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation 
                on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or 
                otherwise as required by law.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our 
                affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we 
                may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal 
                information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, 
                in the event that Multiple Stream Media or substantially all of 
                its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of 
                the transferred assets.<br>
                <br>
                Your information may be stored and processed in the United 
                States, or in any other country in which Multiple Stream Media 
                or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. 
                By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of 
                information outside of your country.<br>
                <br>
                After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to 
                be removed from our database), Multiple Stream Media will keep 
                your personal information in its archives. Your information will 
                then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove 
                Multiple Stream Media's compliance with any applicable law.<br>
                <br>
                <b>6. Accuracy of Personal Information<br>
                </b><br>
                Multiple Stream Media will use reasonable efforts to keep 
                customer personal information accurate for the Identified 
                Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making 
                inappropriate customer decisions based on such information. 
                Customers are responsible for informing Multiple Stream Media 
                about changes to their personal information. You can do this by 
                calling 845-383-1007. Multiple Stream Media will use new or 
                updated personal information it receives from customers to
