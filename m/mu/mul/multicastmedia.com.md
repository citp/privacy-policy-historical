### COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.

We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on our site. An IP address if a number assigned to your computer by a web server when you are on the web. When you are on our site, we have a back-end server that logs your computer’s IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.

### USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION

We use information held about you in the following ways:

  * To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us
  * To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we consider are similar to those you have already purchased or enquired about
  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so
  * To notify you about changes to our site
  * To ensure that the content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer
  * To provide you, or allow permitted third parties to provide you, with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you
  * For any other purpose with your consent



### DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

You agree that we have the right to share your personal data with:

  * Any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006.
  * Selected third parties including: 
    * business partners, supplier and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;
    * with any prospective seller or buyer in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets;
    * with any purchaser in the event that we are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data will be one of the transferred assets.
  * Regulatory organisation or other third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with legal obligations, or in order to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers or others, or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or other illegal activity.



We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this privacy policy.
