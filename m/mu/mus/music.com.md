# Music.com ||| Privacy Policy

Music.com cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [privacy@mdc.music.com](mailto:privacy@mdc.music.com).

### Information Collection and Use by Music.com

Music.com collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send newsletters, updates and notifications to users relating to the Music.com service. Music.com also collects other profile data in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other including but not limited to musical interests, gender, age, location and occupation.

Music.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information, such as IP address and browser type, from all users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. 

User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Music.com social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Music.com, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, personal messages, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on Music.com with each other through the Music.com service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members.

From time to time, Music.com or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from.

### Member Invitations

Music.com members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Music.com stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Music.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders, and notifications of member services (such as messages from other members). Recipients of invitations from Music.com may contact Music.com to request the removal of this information from our database.

### Third Party Advertising

Ads appearing on the Music.com site may be delivered to users by Music.com or one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time you are served an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Music.com and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertiser. 

### Security

Music.com member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. Music.com takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. For any additional information about the security measures we use on Music.com, please contact us at [privacy@mdc.music.com](mailto:privacy@mdc.music.com).

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it.
