We do not collect any special category data such as information on your racial or ethnic origins, political opinions, trade union affiliations, sexual life or criminal history.

Our websites use cookies (small data files placed on your computer or other device), web analytics and web logs to collect information about your use of our site, information about your computer such as your computer’s IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you arrived at our site via a link from a third party site, the URL of the linking page.

## 3.    How We Use The Information We Collect

Our primary purpose in collecting your information is to provide you with a service. You agree that we may use your personal information to:

  * Provide the service to you
  * Notify you about your service
  * Carry out internal administration and analysis
  * Monitor or improve the performance of, and products and services available through, our websites



If you purchase or subscribe to one or more of our magazines, you will enter into a contract with us. This means that during the contractual period we will communicate with you about this contract. In this respect ‘performance of a contract’ is our legal basis for processing your data.

Similarly, advertiser data will be processed under ‘performance of a contract’ if the third party enters into a commercial contract ie. pays for advertising in our magazines and/or websites.

For client prospect data, we will use ‘Legitimate Interest’ as our legal basis for contacting prospective clients. An opt out for these types of communication will be offered on the channel used, for example, via email or telephone call.

## 4.    How We Use The Information For Marketing

We will only send you direct marketing communications in circumstances where we have your specific consent or where we believe we can demonstrate a legitimate interest.

When you sign up to any of our services, we ask for your consent to send you direct marketing communication over a variety of channels. We will honour your right to withdraw your consent at any time.

When you enquire about or request a service from us, we may rely on our legitimate business interests to send you marketing communications (via post, email or telephone). This relates to individual customers as well as clients eg, advertisers. These communications will always be related to our services and we believe will be of interest to you.  We will always provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of marketing communications when you provide your information to us.

If you want to stop receiving direct marketing from us, you can use the unsubscribe mechanism on any email you receive, tell us when we call you, or alternatively you can contact the Data Protection Officer using the details available in the Privacy Summary.

**Email Marketing**

We use web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns. If you open an email from us, we can see which of the pages of our website you visited. Our web beacons communicate with our cookies on your computer and they can tell us when you have opened an email from us. We keep track of the emails that we send you. We also keep a record of what communications you have selected to receive or not to receive. We will only send you marketing emails if you have consented to receive these. You are able to access your preference centre from any marketing email that we send you and update your preferences through this mechanism. You may also unsubscribe by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any of our emails to you.

**Data Profiling and Remarketing**

Periodically we conduct data profiling on the information we collect to better understand our customers in order to provide targeted communications which suit your needs. We rely on ‘legitimate interests’ as our lawful basis for processing this data.

Some of our websites use the Facebook pixel which allows us to analyse behaviour on our own websites and then remarket with relevant messages via Facebook. A Facebook pixel is code placed on our website. It helps track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified leads. We rely on ‘legitimate interests’ as our lawful basis for processing this data.

We sometimes use Facebook to create lookalike audiences based on profiling our subscribers.

We also use the Google Display Network as a channel for remarketing to our users.

In order to serve adverts on our websites and report on their performance, we use an advertising management system. This system gathers information using IP addresses. This allows us to target adverts by geo-location and device in order to make adverts from third parties more relevant to the user.

We also serve targeted adverts for our own products based on user behaviour on our own websites.

Legitimate interest is used as the lawful basis for data profiling and remarketing. However, if we target email data for this activity we will use opted in data where the user has consented to marketing.

If you wish to stop your information being used for data profiling and remarketing, please contact the Data Protection Officer.
