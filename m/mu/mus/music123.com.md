# Music123 : Customer Service

Your privacy is important to us. We will not share any personally identifiable information with anyone for any reason without your explicit permission. 

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. 

How We Use Your Information  
When ordering, you will create a personal account. Through this account, you provide certain types of information such as physical address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date. Without this information, an order cannot be shipped and/or billed. An email may be sent to you, or a phone call made if there is any trouble processing your order. Personal demographic data, such as age, gender, and income are optional. They are not required to browse the site, create an account, or to order from us. This information is stored and viewed collectively. The data allows us to better understand your interests, and provide better service and more appropriate product offerings. We may at times share aggregated demographic information with carefully selected partners and advertisers. This data is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use various shipping companies to deliver your order, and a credit card processing company to bill you for those goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store nor use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. This site may at times make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Caution should be exercised when deciding to disclose personal information. We will not sell, share, nor rent this information to any third party marketer without your express knowledge and consent as outlined in this statement. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. At that time, information may be shared with the parent, subsidiary or merger partner involved in the transaction. We also reserve the right to sell our interest in membership information as a separate asset of the corporation in the event of a major restructuring or similar corporate event. 

Correcting & Updating Your Information  
If there is a change to be made to your personally identifiable information - such as a zip code, email address, or area code changes - such editing may be done by accessing My Account and clicking on Edit. 

Opting-Out  
You are given the opportunity to opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to this site at the point where the information is asked. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, catalog or promotional materials from our partners, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the specific directions included in every email message. You can also unsubscribe from our email newsletters or from our catalog by updating Your Preferences under My Account.

Newsletter/Catalog Registration  
In addition to special announcements and offers exclusive to email recipients, the newsletter allows you to edit account information, change the type of announcements and offers received, and change the format of the message (from text only to text and graphics). Each message also allows you to immediately unsubscribe from future email messages. At the time of email newsletter registration you are asked whether you would like to receive special offers from approved partners. This option may always be edited at the catalog/newsletter sign-up page.

Surveys & Contests  
From time-to-time this site requests information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Security  
We take every precaution to protect your privacy. When you submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and offline. When sensitive information such as a credit card number is required, that information is transmitted with the most advanced encryption software in the industry - SSL. All personal information is protected offline as well in our restricted offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing specialist or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers on which information is stored are kept in a secure and closely monitored environment.

Log Files   
For each visitor to our site, the web server automatically recognizes and collects, where possible, the domain name/IP address, pages visited, length of visit, and other general usage data. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information. It is collected and stored with the same information from all visitors in a log file. This log file is then used to determine general site usage patterns and to analyze trends so that a more useful, streamlined experience may be provided.

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive. Cookies allow us to optimize your experience on the site. For instance, by setting a cookie, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on this site. Once you close you browser, the cookie simply terminates. If you reject the cookie, you may still use this site. However, your usage in some areas of the site may be limited. 

Children  
We do not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults as a small percentage of our business. If you are under 13, you may use this site only with express permission of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not register on our site without the express written consent of a parent or guardian. 

When Leaving This Site  
This web site contains links to other, non-affiliated sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you when you leave this site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.

Take Privacy Seriously   
We believe our Policy provides you with the safest shopping experience possible. Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. If policy changes are substantial, we will do our best to notify you.

If you have any questions about the security of our website, or your privacy, please contact us.
