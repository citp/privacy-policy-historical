We may at times share aggregated demographic information with carefully selected partners and advertisers. This data is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

At that time, information may be shared with the parent, subsidiary or merger partner involved in the transaction. We also reserve the right to sell our interest in membership information as a separate asset of the corporation in the event of a major restructuring or similar corporate event. ****

Examples include order fulfillment, shipment of goods, and credit card processing to bill you for those goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store nor use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
