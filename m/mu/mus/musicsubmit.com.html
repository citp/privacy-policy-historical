                  promoters and other music professionals. &nbsp;<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  To assist you in using our www. MusicSUBMIT.com web site (the "Web
                  Site" or the "Site"), and to ensure a clear understanding of
                  the relationship arising from your use of our Site, we have
                  created a Privacy Policy and a set of <a href="http://www.sonicbids.com/about/terms.asp" target="_blank"><u>Terms
                  and Conditions of Use</u></a>. Our Privacy Policy explains
                  how we protect and treat contact and other information you
                  provide to us through the Site, and our Terms and Conditions
                  of Use govern your use of our Site generally. Please read our
                  Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Use carefully
                  - they impose legal obligations on you. By using or accessing
                  our Site, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood
                  these terms and agree to be legally bound by them.
                  <p align="center"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                  <p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy")
                    constitutes the agreement between you and MusicSUBMIT regarding
                    your provision, and our collection and use, of contact and
                    other information you may provide while using our Site. In
                    this Privacy Policy, the words "you" and "your" refer to
                    any person accessing the Site, and the words   "we," "us," and "our" refer

                    <strong>1. Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    We have organized the elements of our Privacy Policy in sections.
                    If after reading through the Privacy Policy you still have
                    questions, please feel free to contact us by clicking on

                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      2. The Types Of Information You Potentially May Provide</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    This Privacy Policy only applies to information you provide
                    to us online while visiting or using our Site. It does not
                    apply to information we have obtained offline or through
                    other traditional means. Information you may provide in visiting
                    or using our Site falls into two broad categories: personally
                    identifiable information, and aggregate information. "Personally
                    Identifiable Information" is information that can be used
                    to identify or contact you, such as your name, phone number,
                    email address, or mailing address. "Aggregate Information" is
                    information that does not identify you, and may include,
                    for example, statistical information concerning the web pages
                    on our Site that users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy
                    governs both categories of information, as detailed below.   &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      2.1. Information That Identifies You: Personally Identifiable
                      Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    We allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with
                    Personally Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have
                    structured our Web Site so that you may visit our Site, and
                    review a range of information about bands, musicians other
                    materials relating to the music industry, without revealing
                    your identity or providing any Personally Identifying Information.   &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    One of our goals in creating this Web Site, however, is to
                    enable bands and musicians to post information about themselves
                    and their music (for example, through a MusicSUBMIT Press
                    Kit ("MPK™")), and to enable music promoters and other
                    music professionals to access such postings and book appearances.
                    Therefore, in order to post any such information and book
                    appearances, and in order to access certain other materials
                    or information from our Site, we ask that you register and
                    provide us with contact and other information, as provided
                    below. &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      2.1.1. Registration Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    To post information on our Site, and to obtain access to
                    certain other materials or information from our Site, we
                    ask that you become a registered user. Our registration forms
                    will specify the information which you must provide in order
                    to enjoy the particular feature, and the information which
                    you may, at your option, choose to provide or withhold. Our
                    obligations concerning, and permitted uses of, any Personally
                    Identifiable Information that you provide during the registration
                    process are set out below. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    As indicated above, you may use our Site without registering
                    or submitting any information to us. In that case, the only
                    information we collect from your visit will be Aggregate
                    Information that does not identify you in any way. Our obligations
                    concerning, and permitted uses of, Aggregate Information
                    are also set out below. &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      2.1.2. Surveys and Questionnaires </strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    If you choose to participate in surveys or questionnaires
                    which from time to time we may post on the Site, we may ask
                    that, in addition to providing your responses, you also provide
                    contact and other Personally Identifiable Information. If
                    we link, or combine in any way your responses with your Personally
                    Identifiable Information, we will treat the combined information
                    as Personally Identifiable Information under our Privacy
                    Policy, as provided below. If we separate your responses
                    from, and they are independent of any Personally Identifiable
                    Information, such that a third party reviewing your responses
                    would be unable to link the responses to you or your practice,
                    the responses will be treated as Aggregate Information under
                    our Privacy Policy, again as provided below.   &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      2.1.3. Email And Other Direct Communications</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    From time to time, you may wish to provide us with comments
                    and feedback concerning our Site generally. By communicating
                    with us for these purposes, you may provide us with your
                    email address and other Personally Identifiable Information.
                    We will handle such information that you provide in this
                    manner in accordance with our Privacy Policy for Personally
                    Identifiable Information, set out below. &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      2.2. Information That Does Not Identify You: Aggregate
                      Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    When you browse our Site, the choices you make may provide
                    information concerning your interests and concerning the
                    appeal and efficacy of associated Site features. For example,
                    if you spend time browsing information on events taking place
                    in Georgia and Florida, this suggests that you may have an
                    interest in events in the Southeast generally. If a number
                    of visitors spend time browsing information on events taking
                    place in Georgia and Florida, this may suggest that we have
                    designed this portion of our Site effectively. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Information concerning our visitors' activities at the Site
                    - which pages they visit, and how long they view these pages,
                    for example - is Aggregate Information. This information
                    does not identify a particular user, but does provide potentially
                    useful data concerning our users' preferences and the efficacy
                    and interest of our Site's features. The manner in which
                    we collect Aggregate Information is set out below.&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>2.2.1. Cookies</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    We collect Aggregate Information about your use of our Site
                    through cookies and similar Internet technologies.   "Cookies" are
                    small text files that a web site can use to recognize repeat
                    users, to facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use
                    of the site, and to compile aggregate data to improve the
                    site and focus advertising. Cookies work as follows: a web
                    site will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates
                    your computer with information stored at the site. Your browser
                    places the cookie in its cookies file. When you next access
                    that site on your computer, the site recognizes the cookie,
                    makes the stored information available, and adds new information
                    based on the present visit. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Our cookies do not collect or retain your name or other Personally
                    Identifying Information. In addition, no third parties are
                    permitted to use cookies created at our Site for their own
                    purposes. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    We treat all information collected through cookies and similar
                    Internet technologies as Aggregate Information; our obligations
                    concerning, and permitted uses of, Aggregate Information
                    are set out below. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>2.2.2. Disabling Cookies</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    You may choose not to allow us to collect information through
                    cookies. If you wish, you can set your browser software to
                    reject cookies, and most browsers provide instructions for
                    disabling the cookies feature in their "Help" section. Because
                    cookies can be used to provide certain functionality, if
                    you disable your browser's cookies feature, certain elements
                    of our Site may be unavailable to you. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>2.2.3. IP Addresses </strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    A so-called "Internet Protocol" (IP) address is associated
                    with your computer's connection to the Internet. We use your
                    computer's IP address to maintain contact with you as you
                    navigate through our Site. We also may use your computer's
                    IP address to provide you with personalized content. Similar
                    to cookies, your computer's IP address by itself does not
                    identify you personally. We treat IP addresses, therefore,
                    as Aggregate Information, as provided below. If your IP address
                    is combined by us with any Personally Identifiable Information,
                    the combined information will be treated by us as Personally
                    Identifiable Information, as set out below.&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>2.2.4. Advertisers' Collection Of Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    With Internet technology, it is possible for advertisers,
                    as well as site hosts, to collect information through the
                    use of cookies and other technologies, such as so-called "clear
                    GIF" files. We have no control over, and cannot necessarily
                    protect against, the practices or policies of advertisers
                    or other web site hosts using such technologies.   &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      3. How We Use The Information You Provide </strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    The following section describes how we use the information
                    you provide, and details the specific obligations we undertake
                    to preserve your privacy. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>3.1. Use of Contact Information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    We use Personally Identifiable Information you provide to
                    us on our Site to post your MPK™ and other submissions,
                    and for other purposes specific to our Site. In connection
                    with postings you may request we make on the Site, users
                    of our Site shall have access to such information - which
                    may include personal information about you. For example,
                    your name, address, telephone number and/or email address
                    may be included in your MPK™   listing or other submissions
                    you request we post for contact purposes.   &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    From time to time, we also may use Personally Identifiable
                    Information you give to us to provide you with information
                    concerning newsletters, updates, and other materials related
                    to the purposes of our Site. We also will use this information
                    to respond to questions and comments from you, and to inform
                    you of changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms and Conditions
                    of Use. You are free at any time to opt-out of receiving
                    email and other information we may send to you by following
                    the directions set out below. &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      3.2. We Use Aggregate Information Only In Ways That Do
                      Not Identify You</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    To measure our visitors' interest in and use of various areas
                    of our Site, and for other purposes set out below, we collect
                    Aggregate Information -- which is information that does not
                    identify you. Aggregate Information obtained through cookies,
                    for example, allows us to monitor how many users are visiting
                    our Site, and what areas of the Site present the most interest
                    to our users. We are able then to use this information to
                    improve the functionality and interest of Site. We also use
                    Aggregate Information to prepare statistical and other summary
                    analyses of our users' behavior and characteristics. </p>
                  <p>We may share Aggregate Information, and reports based on
                    this Information, with third parties unrelated to the Site.
                    Rest assured, however, that no such Aggregate Information
                    that we provide to third parties will allow anyone to identify
                    you, or determine anything personal about you. For example,
                    we might report to unrelated third parties (a) the number
                    of users of our Site; (b) the materials our users review
                    while at our Site; or (c) the fact that "45% of our users
                    live on the East Coast." We may charge third parties for
                    this information, and we may or may not limit the third parties'
                    use of this information. We do not allow third parties to
                    attempt to make Aggregate Information personally identifiable
                    by, for example, seeking to combine it with other information.&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>3.3. Any Information Linked With Your Personal Information
                    Is Treated As "Personally Identifiable Information"</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    To advance the goals of our Site, we may link (a) the Personally
                    Identifiable Information you have provided; with (b) Aggregate
                    Information concerning (for example) your interests and preferences,
                    as collected through our cookies. Linking this information
                    will allow us to create information packages and services
                    that are better tailored to your interests and preferences.
                    Among other effects, linking this information may allow us
                    generally to improve and focus our Site. If we combine or
                    link any information with your Personally Identifiable Information,
                    the resulting combination will be treated as Personally Identifiable
                    Information under this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, please
                    be aware that in such instances, personal information about
                    you may be made generally available on the Site in connection
                    with postings you may request we make on the Site, as set
                    forth above. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>4. How We Safeguard Information We Collect</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    We have put in place security systems designed to prevent
                    unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us.
                    These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers
                    and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature
                    of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however,
                    we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information
                    you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration
                    by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized
                    access.   &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      5. How To Obtain Access to Information You Have Provided,
                      And How To Remove Your Information From Our Database</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    We allow you at any time to update, correct, or delete Personally
                    Identifiable Information you have provided us. After submitting
                    your registration information, you can view and modify this
                    information within the "Edit Profile" page of the Site.&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    If you request, we will remove your name and other Personally
                    Identifiable Information from our databases. Please understand,
                    however, that it may be impossible to remove this information
                    completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you
                    wish to remove your name and other Personally Identifiable
                    Information from our database, please contact us.&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Because Aggregate Information does not personally identify
                    our users, we do not provide our users with access to Aggregate
                    Information, and users may not update, revise, or delete
                    any Aggregate Information. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>6. Additional General Provisions</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>6.1. Privacy Protection for Children</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept
                    or request personal information from individuals we know
                    to be under 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided
                    us with Personally Identifiable Information, we will delete
                    this information from our databases, in accordance with our
                    deletion policy, set out above.&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>6.2. Participation in Online Discussions</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    If we include a "chat" or "forum" feature to the Site, you
                    may decide to participate in an online discussion. Please
                    keep in mind that any information you provide while participating
                    in an online chat or forum will be available to all participants.
                    These participants, and their transferees, may use Personally
                    Identifiable Information and other information you disclose
                    in this manner, to contact you and for other purposes. Accordingly,
                    if we choose to provide such features at the Site, we ask
                    that you participate prudently, as this Privacy Policy will
                    not cover the information you disclose in online discussions
                    at our Site. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>6.3. Links To Other Web Sites</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    To give you access to other information relating to the music
                    industry, from time to time we may include on the Web Site
                    certain links to other sites. We provide these links as a
                    convenience, and we do not endorse the content or services
                    offered by, or the privacy policies in place at, these other
                    sites. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Our Privacy Policy covers only information we collect at
                    the Site, and other sites to which we link may have privacy
                    policies that differ considerably from our Privacy Policy.
                    We have structured our Site to make it reasonably clear when
                    you leave our Web Site and enter another web site. We encourage
                    you to review the privacy policies of each site you visit
                    through our links to ensure you are comfortable with these
                    policies. We are not responsible for the conduct or policies
                    of these third parties. &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;<br>
                      6.4. Court Orders, Subpoenas, And Other Required Disclosures</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    There are two exceptions to our Privacy Policy. First, we
                    may disclose Personally Identifiable Information as may be
                    required in legal proceedings, or in response to a subpoena,
                    court order, or administrative order compelling disclosure.
                    Second, in cases involving a threat of imminent harm to you
                    or others, we may release such information to prevent or
                    mitigate the threat. In any such case, we will seek to limit
                    the scope of disclosure, and will disclose only such information
                    as is reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>6.5. Changes in Our Privacy Policy </strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    From time to time we may revise our Privacy Policy. We will
                    post these changes here, in our Privacy Policy. Your use
                    of our Site following any such change constitutes your agreement
                    to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed. &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>6.6. Relationship to Term of Use</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    In addition to this Privacy Policy, your use of our Site
                    is also subject to our Terms and Conditions of Use (our "Terms
                    of Use"). The provisions of our Terms of Use are incorporated
                    herein, including, without limitation, Sections 12 (Choice
                    of Law and Jurisdiction), 14 (Assignment), 17 (Severability),
                    18 (Survival) and 19 (Complete Agreement). &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>7. Your Consent</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                    By using our Web Site, you consent to our collection and
                    use of information, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                    If you do not agree with some, or all of the terms of this
                    Privacy Policy, please refrain from becoming a registered
                    user, or from visiting our Site. &nbsp;<br>
