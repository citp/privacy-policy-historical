The information we receive depends upon what you do while visiting our site.

Our site automatically captures IP addresses and Cookie ID's (set by this site) when you visit the site while reading or downloading any information. We also collect the information on what pages visitors' access, view and request, information on referral logs, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as personal, survey, and/or application data. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages, customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual consumer, improve our service, notify consumers about updates to our Web site and contact them for marketing or informational purposes.

If you send an e-mail to our site, you also may decide to send us personally-identifying information. For example, you might include your name, address and phone number in an electronic mail message containing a complaint. We use personally-identifying information from consumers in various ways to further our consumer protection and competition activities. The information you provide may be seen by various company employees, company representatives, and/or law enforcement agencies. For example, we may enter the information you send into our electronic database to share with our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement or public policy development.

In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.
