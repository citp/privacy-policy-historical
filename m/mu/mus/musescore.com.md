If You do not agree with this Privacy Policy, You should not use this Website. Your use of this Website signifies Your agreement with all of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy supplements the [MuseScore Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms), and is made a part of the Agreement between MuseScore and its Users. It applies to all the Websites operated by MuseScore or its affiliated companies.

### Which principles does MuseScore apply?

MuseScore is committed to the protection of the privacy and Personal Data of its Users.

MuseScore applies the principles of Data Protection Law, which are that: 

  * Personal Data will only be processed fairly and lawfully;
  * Personal Data will only be processed for the purposes set forth in this Policy, and in accordance with Your rights;
  * Personal Data collected will be adequate, relevant and not excessive in the light of these purposes;

  * Personal Data will be held secure;
  * Personal Data will only be transferred in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws;
  * You will be able to ensure at all times that Your Personal Data are accurate.



### Which data are collected, and what are Personal Data?

Three categories of data are collected by MuseScore.

First category: Your Personal Account Data. These are the Personal Data that You are requested to submit when You open Your User account. Examples are your name, address, certain music or other preferences, etc. 

Second category: Other Personal Data. These are Personal Data, other than the Personal Account Data, that You submit through the Website (e.g. through use of a forum, or otherwise), and that qualify as Personal Data, because, among others, they allow You to be identified. Remember that any information disclosed in this way (including Personal Account Data You choose to make available in this way) becomes public information. You should exercise great care when deciding to disclose Your Personal Data and information in a public forum.

Third category: Anonymous Information. This is information collected through the Website that does not qualify as Personal Data. It includes server log information, cookies or other similar technical information. Server logs may include information such as Your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of Your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify Your browser. MuseScore uses cookies to improve the quality of its Services, including for storing User preferences, improving search results and tracking User trends. The nature and amount of Anonymous Information may change over time, as a result of changes in technology, Services, etc. 

### For which purposes will MuseScore use Personal Data or share it with third parties?

You agree that by submitting your Personal Data to the Website, MuseScore may use and/or share with third parties your Personal Data for the following purposes: 

  * For managing Your User Account, including sending a password when reported forgotten, linking Your name to the content You created, providing the Services offered, sending subscription-based emails, to which you can unsubscribe, regarding Your Account, the Website or the Services, and for collecting payments.
  * To deliver, monitor, develop and improve the Website and the Services and to provide You with a better and more personalized User experience.
  * For general advertising and marketing purposes (including audit, data analysis and research). MuseScore may share demographic, profile and other general information about You and other Users with our partners on an aggregate basis.
  * For direct marketing purposes to You, but only when You have given permission
  * If required to do so by law, regulation or under a good faith belief that action is necessary to conform to or comply with the law and legal process, to protect and defend MuseScore rights and/or property and customers, whether or not required to do so by law. MuseScore reserves the right to contact appropriate authorities and disclose Personal Data at its discretion when it appears that individuals are using the Website or Services for illegal or infringing activities that otherwise violate the MuseScore Privacy Policy or Terms of Use.
  * To process Personal Data on servers in other countries. We may therefore transfer and process your Personal Data on a server outside Your country or outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. However, MuseScore will always do so in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
  * In relation to a merger or acquisition by another company, or if the business unit providing Your service were sold to another company, Personal Data may be transferred to and used by the resulting combined company. If MuseScore were to cease operations, this Personal Data might be transferred to and used by another company, which offers similar or related products or services.



### How do You know Your Personal Data are correct and complete?

You will at all times have access to Your profile and any Personal Account Data You have submitted. You will be responsible for the content of Your submitted Personal Data, and You will be responsible for such information to keep it truthful, correct and up to date. Please remember that Personal Data You share with other Users may become public.

MuseScore will not modify or adapt Your Personal Data.

### How do You know Your Personal Data are secure?

MuseScore will use adequate technical protection, by using technology commonly used for that purpose, to ensure that your Personal Data remains secure and protected from third party unauthorized access or alteration, loss, or theft.

### What happens to Your Personal Data when You close Your Account?

If You choose to terminate Your Account, Your Personal Account Data will be deleted by MuseScore. Please note, however, that other Users may retain some information or data that You previously shared, and MuseScore will have no responsibility for such shared information or any other information You choose to make publicly available.

### Who can you contact if you have questions?

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, its implementation, or Your Personal Data, please [contact MuseScore](http://musescore.com/contact) or via [privacy@musescore.com](mailto:privacy@musescore.com).

### What law governs this Privacy Policy?

The Website is operated from Belgium, and therefore Belgian law applies (including its implementation of Data Protection Laws). Only Belgian courts will have jurisdiction.

### How will You know if Privacy Policy is updated?

MuseScore reserves the right to make changes to and update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by posting the new version of the Privacy Policy on the Website or may send each User a courtesy email. It is Your responsibility to check the Website for updates to this Privacy Policy.

### Definitions

In addition to definitions set out in the Terms of Use, the following definitions apply to capitalized terms:
