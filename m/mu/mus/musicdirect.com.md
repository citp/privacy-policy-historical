Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Music Direct public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Music Direct does not read any of your private online communications.

Music Direct encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Music Direct so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Music Direct is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Music Direct and Music Direct family of Web sites.

In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Music Direct may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Music Direct to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Music Direct Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Music Direct or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Music Direct; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Music Direct, or the public.

Use of Cookies

The Music Direct Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Music Direct pages, or register with Music Direct site or services, a cookie helps Music Direct to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Music Direct Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Music Direct features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Music Direct services or Web sites you visit.

Security of your Personal Information

Music Direct secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Music Direct secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Changes to this Statement

Music Direct will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Music Direct encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Music Direct is protecting your information.
