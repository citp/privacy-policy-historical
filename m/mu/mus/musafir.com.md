  * Passenger Information. When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through Musafir.com, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Musafir.com with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.
  * Information from Other Sources. We also may periodically obtain information about you from our business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, which we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery of travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better understand your potential purchasing preferences.

We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You may opt not to have this information collected by select third-party advertisers such as on [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).



### How we protect your information

We want you to feel confident about using Musafir.com to plan and purchase your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us.

In addition, we use 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or higher grade encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and our Website, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

All payment transactions on our Website are processed through a service which uses 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or higher grade encryption when transmitting your payment details. We do not process and do not store sensitive payment information such as your credit/debit card number, cardholder name, and expiry date.

Despite these measures, we do not warrant that unauthorized access to your information can never happen and will not be liable for any such unauthorized access unless caused solely by our gross negligence, in which event you will be entitled to compensation up to a maximum of the value of the services purchased by you.

### With whom we share your information

Musafir.com may share your information with the following entities:

  * We share your trip details and personal information required to fulfill your purchase with suppliers, such as hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity providers, who fulfill your purchase. We do not share your email address with these suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation you have made on Musafir.com, and we restrict their use of this information to that purpose. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through Musafir.com. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or to facilitate your purchase.

  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
