<h2>1. An overview of data protection</h2>
<h3>General</h3> <p> 
<a href="">here</a> The following gives a simple overview of what happens to your personal information when you visit our website. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy found below.</p>
<h3>Data collection on our website</h3> <p> 
<a href=""></a> <strong> ﻿<a href=""></a> Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</strong></p> <p> 
<a href=""></a> The data collected on this website are processed by the website operator. The operator's contact details can be found in the website's required legal notice.</p> 
<p> 
<a href=""></a> <strong> <a href=""></a> How do we collect your data?</strong></p> 
<p> 
 Some data are collected when you provide it to us. This could, for example, be data you enter on a contact form, or 
contributions to the collection of melodies. If you enter a new item into the collection, you can pick a license for this item (you can donate it to the public domain or pick one of the creative commons licenses).
Search queries are stored and used for scientific purposes and for improving the search engine. Search queries are stored without a link to a user's name or login, even if they are performed while the user is logged in.
</p><p>Other data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit the website. These data are primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed the page. These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p> <p><strong> <a href=""></a> What do we use your data for?</strong></p> <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data can be used to analyze how visitors use the site.</p> <p><strong> <a href=""></a> What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p> <p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
<h3>Analytics and third-party tools</h3> <p>When visiting our website, statistical analyses may be made of your surfing behavior. This happens primarily using cookies and analytics. The analysis of your surfing behavior is usually anonymous, i.e. we will not be able to identify you from this data. You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. Detailed information can be found in the following privacy policy.</p> <p>You can object to this analysis. We will inform you below about how to exercise your options in this regard.</p>
<h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>

Email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6c01191f051c0908050d421e0d0502091e2c1f0d0a091e1f050b02191c420f0301">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
 <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3> <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3> <p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered.

<h3>Right to data portability</h3> <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3> <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator.

<h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3> <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p> <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p> <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p> <p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>

The input data will only be used for the purpose of using the respective site or service for which you have registered.

<h3>Leaving comments on this website</h3> <p>If you use the comment function on this site, the time at which you created the comment and your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously.</p>
<p><strong> <a href=""></a> Storage of the IP address</strong></p> <p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before they go live, we need this information to be able to pursue action for illegal or slanderous content.</p>
<p><strong> <a href="">click</a> Subscribing to the comment feed</strong></p> <p>As a user of this site, you can sign up to receive the comment feed after registering.

The data provided when you subscribed to the comments feed will then be deleted, but if you have submitted this data to us for other purposes or elsewhere (such as subscribing to a newsletter), it will be retained.</p>
<p><strong> <a href=""></a> How long comments are stored</strong></p> <p>The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content commented upon has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander, etc.).</p>
<p><strong> <a href=""></a> Legal basis</strong></p> <p>The comments are stored based on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect.

<h2>4. Analytics and advertising</h2>
<h3>Matomo (formerly Piwik)</h3> <p>This website uses the open source web analytics service Matomo. Matomo uses so-called "cookies". These are 
text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by
 you. For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie about the use of this website is stored on our

 use of your data, you can disable this feature here. In this case,
 an opt-out cookie will be stored in your
 browser to prevent Matomo from storing your usage data. If you delete your cookies, this will mean that the opt-out cookie will also be deleted. You will then need to reactivate it when you return to our site if you wish your activity not to be tracked.</p> <p>
