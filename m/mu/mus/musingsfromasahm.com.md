This is my personal blog, written and edited by me. I write about what I love, what I find interesting, and what is relevant for my family.

You may see ads on my sidebar. I may receive monetary compensation or they may have an affiliate link, meaning I may receive some money or a discount if you click on it, and/or buy something. There also may be affiliate links throughout some of my posts. I do receive monetary compensation; it helps fund this blog!

We (myself and the review team) do receive free products to keep from companies in exchange for a review. We’ll always tell you in a post if something was sent to us for free. We’ll always give you our honest opinion – they’re not buying us off!

I also do sponsored posts. These are noted at the beginning of each post and mean that I received monetary compensation for sharing the information. I still only share my own opinion!
