		<h1><span>Testimonial</span></h1>

		<p>
			<span class="lquote qalt">“</span>
			I'm definitely finding Music Teacher's Helper to be useful. I've already had a couple of instances of parents emailing me saying "I just got a lesson reminder. Did I forget to tell you that little Joey won't be able to make it to his lesson this week?" It cuts down on the amount of "no show" lessons by prompting them to remember not only their lessons, but to cancel the lessons they can't attend!
