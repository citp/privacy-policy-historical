<font size="+1"><b>The Museum of Hoaxes Privacy Policy</b></font><br><br>



The Museum of Hoaxes is committed to your privacy. That's why it has a privacy policy in order to let you know how any information collected about you by the museum will be used. Our policy is as follows:<br><br>

<b>Cookies:</b> The Museum does not use cookies to collect information. Therefore, while you're here at the museum you don't need to worry about this aspect of internet surveillance at all. We simply don't do it.<br><br>

<b>Email:</b> The Museum collects the email addresses of people who have voluntarily sent their address to us via the newsletter sign-up form. Occasionally (once every few months) a newsletter will be sent to all those people who have signed up in this way. However, no email addresses are ever shared with any third party outside of the museum. We keep all the addresses under lock and key. We're never, ever going to sell your email to spammers.<br><br>

<b>Correspondence:</b> If you send correspondence to the Museum, we reserve the right to post details of that correspondence on the website, unless you specifically request that we not do this, in which case we will obviously honor your request. However, we will never post your email address anywhere on the website. That information will always remain confidential. Even if you ask us to post the address, we're probably not going to do it (otherwise spammers would constantly be asking us to post their contact info).<br><br>
