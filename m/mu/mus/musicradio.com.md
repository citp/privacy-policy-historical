If we do need to transfer your personal information in this way we take steps to ensure your level of privacy including data minimisation, anonymising or pseudonymising data, undertaking due diligence on the recipients and putting in place contractual obligations on them to take care of your data, for example EU model clauses, or in the case of US recipients, a Privacy Shield certification.
