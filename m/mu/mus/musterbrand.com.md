# Privacy policy | Musterbrand Store

The privacy of your personal data is very important to Musterbrand GmbH ("Musterbrand"). We would like to inform you at this point of how we collect, store, and use your data. Of course, we follow the legal requirements of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the German Tele-media Act (TMG), and other data privacy laws.

Your sensitive data is transmitted to us in a form that is encrypted by digital security systems. Our website is furthermore protected by technical measures against damage, destruction, or unauthorized access.

**Personal data**

Personal data is the subject matter of data protection. According to Section 3 (1) BDSG, this means specific information about personal and factual matters concerning a natural person, such as name, postal address, email address, credit or debit card numbers and other data about payment instruments, age, interests, and any usage data such as IP addresses.

**Data collection and storage**

You provide us with personal data in the course of using our website. We collect and store this personal data only to the extent necessary to provide the service or to execute the contract. It may also be necessary to provide your personal data to companies that we engage to perform the service or to handle the contract. These are for example payment service providers, transportation companies and other service providers.

In particular, your personal data is collected and stored:

  * • If you log in or register for a customer account through the site,
  * • If you order a product or view content on our website,
  * • If you register for a newsletter, or
  * • If you leave a comment or a product evaluation.



We primarily use your personal data:

  * • To process your purchases and returns,
  * • To answer your questions and/or requests, and
  * • To personalize your visit to the site by presenting you with customized products and offers.



After your order has been completely processed, your data is blocked and then deleted after expiration of applicable tax and trade law regulations, unless you have explicitly agreed to any other use of the data.

If you have registered your email address for our newsletter, we will also use your email address beyond the processing of the contract for our own advertising purposes, until you cancel your subscription to the newsletter.

**Collection and storage of usage data**

To optimize our Web site, we collect and store data such as the date and time of page retrieval, the page from which you accessed our site, and similar information. This is carried out on an anonymous basis without personally identifying the user of the site. If necessary, user profiles are prepared using a pseudonym. Even in this case, there is no link between the natural person behind the pseudonym and the usage data collected. We also use "cookies" to collect and store usage data. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer that are used for the storage of statistical information such as the operating system, browser, IP address, the previously called Web site (referrer URL) and the date/time. We only collect this data for statistical purposes to continue to optimize our homepage and to make our Internet offering even more attractive. Collection and storage takes place only in anonymised or pseudonymised form and cannot be used to identify you as a natural person.

Of course, you can also view our Web site without cookies. If you do not want us to recognize your computer, you can prevent the storage of cookies on your hard drive by selecting "Do not accept cookies" in your browser settings. The details of how that works can be found in the instructions from your browser manufacturer. If you do not accept cookies, however, this could lead to functional restrictions in our offerings.

**Data collection by third-party plug-ins**

The integration of plug-ins by third-party providers can cause information about you, such as your operating system, browser, IP address, the page currently being retrieved, the previous page retrieved (referrer URL) and the date/time of the page visit, to be transmitted to them as soon as you access our Web site.
