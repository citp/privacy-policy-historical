If we learn of such behavior, MustHaveMenus will close the child's account and delete all information collected about that person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MustHaveMenus may choose to retain the child's e-mail address as a means to prevent the child from re-registering with MustHaveMenus.

  3. The right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.
