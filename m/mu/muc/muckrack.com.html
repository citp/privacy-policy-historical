<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

   <p>The Muck Rack and Muck Rack Pro services, including (without limitation) all
   websites, mobile applications and other interactive properties through which the
   service is delivered (collectively, the "Service") are owned, operated and
   distributed by Sawhorse Media, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (referred to
   in this Privacy Policy as "Sawhorse" or "we" and through similar words such as "us,"
   "our," etc.).&nbsp; By accessing any part of the service, you are agreeing to the
   terms and conditions described below (the "PRIVACY POLICY") AND THE TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS OF OUR TERMS OF SERVICE&nbsp; <a href="/terms">(the "TERMS OF SERVICE")</a>. <b>If you do not
   agree to any of these terms, YOU SHOULD not use the Service.</b> This Privacy Policy
   applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available
   via the Service and users who have subscribed for services and/or are contributors of
   content via the Service.</p>

   <p>We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time.&nbsp; By
   accessing the Service at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to such
   modifications.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy was last modified as of September 9,
   2011.</p>

   <h2>What Personally Identifiable Information Does Sawhorse Collect?</h2>

   <p>We collect the following types of personally identifiable information:</p>

   <ul type="disc">
     <li><b>User Provided Information:</b> You may affirmatively provide us with certain
     personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, credit card
     information, etc.) when participating in various activities on the Service.</li>

     <li><b>Information Collected by "Cookies":</b> When you access the Service, we may
     send one or more "cookies" to your computer.&nbsp; A "cookie" is a small line of
     text that is stored with your browser, which we use to help provide better service
     to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when
     a cookie is sent. We may use cookies for many purposes, including (without
     limitation) to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you
     visit the Service, and to deliver content (which may include third party
     advertisements) specific to your interests. </li>

     <li><b>Log File Information:</b> Our servers automatically record certain
     information that your browser sends whenever you access the Service. These server
     logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")
     address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform
     type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of
     those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of
     your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
     </li>

     <li><b>Information Collected by "Clear GIFs":</b> We may employ "clear GIFs"
     (a.k.a. Web Beacons), which are used to track usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in
     a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in
     HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
     </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>How Does Sawhorse Use Personally Identifiable Information?</h2>

   <p>Any personal information that you voluntarily disclose online (in messages and
   chat areas, within your public profile page, through a User Submission, etc.) becomes
   publicly available and can be collected and used by others.</p>

   <p>If you have not opted out from receiving these communications from us, we may use
   your email address, phone number or other personally identifiable information to send
   commercial or marketing messages. We also may use your email address, phone number
   and other personally identifiable information for non-marketing or administrative
   purposes (such as notifying you of major Service changes or for customer service
   purposes).&nbsp; You cannot opt out of receiving communications for non-marketing or
   administrative purposes. </p>

   <p>We use aggregated information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP
   addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of
   the Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by
   storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.&nbsp; In addition, we
   may use "cookies," clear gifs and log file information to deliver content (which may
   include third party advertisements) specific to your interests, and remember
   information so that you will not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Service.
   </p>

   <h2>Will Sawhorse Share Personally Identifiable Information with Others?</h2>

   <p>We will not share your personally identifiable information with other, third-party
   companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as
   part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or
   opt-out.</p>

   <p>We may provide personally identifiable information to employees, consultants,
   affiliates or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such
   information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we require that these parties agree
   to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply in all respects with
   this Privacy Policy.</p>

   <p>We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
   data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with
   interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for
   certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the
   Service. </p>

   <p>In addition, we may release personally identifiable information:&nbsp; (i) to the
   extent we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with any
   applicable law, enforce any provision of the Terms of Service, protect ourselves
   against any liability, defend ourselves against any claims, protect the rights,
   property and personal safety of any user or protect the public welfare; or (ii) to
   respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. </p>

   <h2>Third Party Advertisers</h2>

   <p>We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
   serve advertisements within the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks
   use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that
   appear on the Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
   They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to
   measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising
   content you see.&nbsp; You should consult the respective privacy policies of these
   third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for
   instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not
   apply to them, and we cannot control their activities. </p>

   <p>&nbsp;</p>

   <h2>Is My Information Secure?</h2>

   <p>We have implemented security measures to protect personally identifiable
   information collected on the Service against loss, misuse or alteration. In addition,
   your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It
   is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your password and to
   your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.&nbsp;
   Moreover, despite the precautions described above, we cannot and do not guarantee
   that the individual user information you have transmitted will not be intercepted by
   others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed, and we accept no liability for any
   unintentional disclosure. </p>

   <h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2>

   <p>In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we
   reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from users
   as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the
   unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or
   assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable
   principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how
   your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>

   <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

   <p>You must be at least 13 years old to register to use the Service.</p>

   <h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>

   <p>The Service is hosted in the United States and is primarily intended for and
   directed to users in the United States. If you are accessing the Service from the
   European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal
   data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be
   advised that through your continued use of the Service, which is governed by U.S.
   law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your
   personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>

   <p><b>California Privacy Rights<br></b><br>
   California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Service who are California
   residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal
   information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a
   request, please send an e-mail with "California Privacy Rights" in the heading to
   <a href="mailto:privacy@sawhorsemedia.com">privacy@sawhorsemedia.com</a>&nbsp; or write
   us at:<br>
