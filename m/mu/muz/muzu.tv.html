					Providing us with your email address gives us the chance to email you a new password in case you forget or lose your old one.

Our emails are sent from a MUZU™.tv address and are sent to your real email address. Every email that we send has an opt-out URL, so you can unsubscribe when you want.

					We have a sophisticated security program intended to keep the information stored in our systems protected from unauthorised access.

					The bottom line is, when it comes to information security, we mean business. Some of the Music Guys may operate in countries such as the United States (or otherwise outside of the EU) so as a result Your Info may therefore be transferred beyond the shores of the EU. Giving any of Your Info to us means you agree your continued use of Our Website is your consent to this transfer.
