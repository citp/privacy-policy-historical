The Publish Playback feature allows users who are logged into their Muziic accounts to share playlist data information from the Muziic Player. By default, the Publish Playback feature is enabled for users who have logged into the Muziic Player. Users may opt out of this feature by disabling Publish Playback in the Muziic Player settings menu. With Muziic Web Player, Publish Playback is always on, however, users may logout to avoid attributing plays to their account.
