MuggleNet is an unofficial fan site. We did not create Harry Potter or any of the characters from the Harry Potter series. The staff has a mortal fear of lawyers - the site isn't here to infringe upon any copyrights or break any laws, it's here to be a resource for Harry Potter fans. If you have a problem with something you saw on the site, don't hesitate to contact us via our [feedback form](http://www.mugglenet.com/feedback/). Additional bandwidth provided by [The-Hosts.com](http://www.the-hosts.com/). MuggleNet's layout was designed and created by [Navy](mailto:navy_o@hotmail.com).
