# Muggn » Privacy Policy

**The effective date of this Agreement is March 12, 2009.**

This website allows people to share information with each other and the broader community. To accomplish this, we gather information from and about users and share it with others, as described in more detail below.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “this website” refers to the various web pages located at the www.muggn.com domain, and excludes any web pages that might be linked to the www.muggn.com domain that are not owned and operated by Bet-R Sites, LLC. The term “user” refers to a user of, or visitor to, this website. The terms “we”, “us”, and “Bet-R” refer to Bet-R Sites, LLC. The terms “you” and “your” refer to you, as a user. 

By using this website, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.

**1\. Information We Collect**

We collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on this website (your “Profile Information”), including your name, email address, and optional information supplied by you such as identities maintained by you with other services such as ICQ and AIM. We also collect information in the form of the content that you submit in the course of your use of this website (your “Content”), such as comments and other communications made by you. If, for example, you choose to post a comment that includes your home address and phone number, that becomes a part of the data “collected” because you provided it. Finally, we also collect other information relating to your activity on this website that you do not explicitly submit to us (your “Nonpersonal Information”), such as your actions on this website, your browser, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.

**2\. How We Use Your Information**

We store information about you and your use of this website, including your Content, Profile Information, and Nonpersonal Information. In addition, we display your Content to other users of this website in order to share your Content with other members and the broader community. Your Profile Information (excluding your email address and other information you choose not to have displayed) may also be displayed in connection with your Content.

We may use your email address to send you updates or news regarding this website as part of a general communication to members. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you individually about issues with your account or other matters related to your use of this website.

We use Nonpersonal Information to help us diagnose problems with our server, administer this website, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use Nonpersonal Information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.

**3\. Transfer of Information**

We will not sell or distribute your Content or your Profile Information to third parties except under circumstances described below.

A feature of this website is the “Keeper” image. This is the combination of an image posted by the site’s administrators and a comment posted by a user. We allow users to make Keeper images from any comment, and we allow users to post or link to the resulting Keeper image outside of this website, which includes the text of the associated comment. Keeper images do not include the name, member name or any personally-identifiable information about the user who posted the original comment. Only the content of the comment itself is included in the Keeper image.

We may disclose information about you and your use of this website if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. We are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.

Further, we may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to transfer information about you and your use of this website in the event of a transfer of ownership of this website, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Bet-R will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**4\. Others’ Information**

You may choose to provide us with another person’s email address so that person may be invited to create an account on this website. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.

**5\. Links**

This website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. Except as set forth herein, we do not share information about you and your use of this website with those third parties, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on all such third party websites.

**6\. Use of Cookies**

This website requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user’s computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our website and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter this website without explicitly typing in their User I.D. and password every time. We also use cookies placed by third parties to serve our advertising. You should be aware that we cannot control the use of cookies by outside advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on this website.

**7\. Controlling Your Personal Information**

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose information about yourself in the Content that you submit to this website (e.g., including your name or email address in a post to this website), that information can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from others. Such activities are beyond our control. Please do not post any personal information on this website that you expect to keep private.

**8\. Security**

Your Member account is password-protected. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information to those who need access to perform fuctions related to member account management. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

You hereby acknowledge that Bet-R is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
