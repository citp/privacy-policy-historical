All Services are hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, mHelpDesk.com provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data.

13\. SCOPE OF THIS POLICY.

This privacy policy is intended to apply only to the use of our website and service. If you are using mHelpDesk and click on a link and are redirected to a third party website, any information that you share with such third party will be governed by its privacy policy and not ours.

14\. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND EMERGENCIES.

As stated above, mHelpDesk will not share personal information with third parties without your knowledge and consent. mHelpDesk will, however, comply with a valid and binding governmental demand, such as a court order, subpoena, or search warrant as required.

15\. UPDATES AND CHANGES.

We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time, as our service becomes more sophisticated and includes more features, but we will let you know each time we do, by posting a detailed notice on the login page or by other reasonable methods of providing notice.
