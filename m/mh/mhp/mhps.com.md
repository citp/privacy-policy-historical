**1\. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors**

The Company automatically collects and/or tracks the following: (1) the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client computer, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Company's web site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with the Company via e-mail, post messages to the Company's bulletin boards, or post messages to the Company's chat groups, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registrations forms, surveys, and contest entries, and (4) aggregate and/or user-specific information on what pages are visited within the Company's Web site.

The Company may from time to time place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies contain identifying information about the user which can only be accessed by The Company's servers. When the visitor revisits the Company's Web site, the Company will recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly. Internet cookies are stored on the visitor's hard drive and are not stored, in any form, by the Company. Visitors may decline the Internet cookie by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.

When a visitor performs a search on the Company's search engine, the Company records information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. As necessary to provide service, the Company does record limited information for every search request and uses that information only to solve technical problems with the service and to calculate overall usage statistics.

**2\. Use of Personal Data Collected**

The Company's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as their name and e-mail addresses), financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, or income level). The Company uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about the Company and promotional material from some of the Company's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may want to contact the Company's visitors. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for use of the various services offered by the Company, to bill the user for products and services, and for other purposes. Demographic and profile data is also collected by the Company. The Company uses this data for other purposes. Personal data collected by the Company will be used by the Company for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product and services development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, and to customize content and layout of the Company's Web site. Data on visitors' home servers is aggregated for internal review and then discarded. Names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected may be added to the Company's databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online.

**3\. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties**

In connection with the utilization of the Company's Listing Services, user's contact information (name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail) will be provided on the Company's Web Site. Any third party other than these users to which the Company shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data of subscribers to its services will be carefully pre-screened by the Company, determined by the Company to be reputable, and will use the personal data for marketing products and services which the Company determines, in its sole judgment, that visitors might find of interest.

**4\. Opt-Out Right**

Visitors may opt out of having their personal information collected by the Company, used by the Company for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by the Company or third parties to send promotional correspondence to the visitor, by contacting the Company via postal mail, e-mail, or telephone, or by checking the appropriate box on the online forms. However, if the Company has provided a user's information to a Third Party, and subsequently receives an "opt-out" request from a user, it will cease its own contact with the user but may not be able to cause the Third Party(s) to stop its contact.

**5\. Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data**

Upon request via postal mail, e-mail, or phone, the Company will provide to visitors a summary of any personal information retained by the Company regarding the visitor. Visitors may modify, correct, change, or update their personal record or cause their personal record to be removed from the Company's database. The Company will only send personal records to the e-mail address on file for the visitor name associated with it.
