	This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> does not own 
	or control, or to people that <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> does not employ or manage. <br><br>
        
	 
	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> collects personal information when you register with 
	<span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span>, when you use <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> 
	products or services, and when you visit <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> pages or the pages of certain 
	<span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> partners. <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span>
        may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. <br><br>
 
	When you register we ask for information such as your name, address, email address, zip code and other information. Once you register with 
	<span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. <br><br>
 
	<span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business
        partners, including information about your use of services that we offer. <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> 
	automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, 
	<span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> cookie information, and the page you request. 
	<span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and
        content you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our services, to contact you, to conduct research, and to provide

	We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span>. 
	These companies may use your personal information to help <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> communicate with you about 
	offers from <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span> and our marketing partners. <br><br>
 
	We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is 
	necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
        potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of <span class="mh">MH</span><span class="village">Village.com</span>'s 
	terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. <br><br>

	or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that
