# Cookie Policy - MWC Americas

### What is a Cookie?

‘Cookies’ are small text files that websites may place on your computer, mobile device or tablet. They’re used to remember what you have done on a website in order to improve your browsing experience, to help remember log-ins, or to provide advertising while visiting a particular site.

### What is a Web Beacon?

Web beacons are images embedded in a web page. We use web beacons to see which of our email messages are opened or forwarded so we can better understand what types of email messages our customers are interested in and how we can improve our communication with our customers.

### Our Policy is Simple.

We ONLY use cookies to deliver a smooth experience to our website visitors and to understand how visitors use our websites. We do this because we want you to have a great experience browsing our sites, so we can provide you with relevant content and so that we can continually improve the service we provide you.

This means that we DON’T identify you personally as a user of our website, and we DON’T use cookies to target you with advertising.

You can decide whether to accept or reject cookies from us – it’s your choice.

### Why do we use them?

We use different types of cookies for different functions.

Some cookies allow you to stay logged in while you browse our site. If you didn’t have a cookie for this purpose, you would need to log in every time you loaded a different page from our site. We think this would be a very annoying experience.

Cookies help us identify which of our articles, discussions, videos or documents are the most popular and what type of journey a visitor has through our sites. After all, we don’t want to spend a lot of time publishing things no one is interested in.

We place a cookie when you visit a page on which we show an advert. This helps us to collect anonymous information about how frequently adverts are clicked and to understand how interesting and attractive our adverts are. We don’t pass this information to third parties.

### Do I have a choice over the use of cookies?

Yes. There are a number of options available. You can set your browser either to reject all cookies, to only allow “trusted” sites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from those websites which you are using at that moment.

### Some of the functionality of our website will be lost if you delete all cookies.

All of the ‘popular’ browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings are usually found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your browser. To help you better understand these settings, the following links may be helpful to you, otherwise you should use the ‘Help’ option in your browser for more details.

### Google Analytics

We use performance type cookies such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to better understand how visitors use our site, for example, which pages are viewed, how long customers spend visiting a particular page and how often they return to visit our site. This information assists our marketing and sales teams to understand which of our pages are performing well and which pages require improvement.

### Clicky

Clicky is used for collecting anonymous website usage statistics. The information that is collected includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/entry/visited/exit pages, to analyse trends, administer the site, and track user’s movement around the site.
