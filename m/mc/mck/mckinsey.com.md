###### McKinsey Recruitment Portal / McKinsey Retention Program

To assist McKinsey with its staffing and recruitment, McKinsey has partnered with SalesForce.com to provide the McKinsey Recruitment Portal. If you provide information through the Recruitment Portal, your personally-identifiable information will be held on servers located in the US, managed by SalesForce.com. SalesForce.com has agreed to provide the same level of privacy and data protection that you enjoy when interacting with this Site and McKinsey generally.

Through the McKinsey Recruitment Portal, job candidates can apply for positions with McKinsey or sign up for the McKinsey Retention Program where you can be notified of any potential job openings or other similar opportunities that might be of interest to you.

McKinsey frequently visits recruiting websites and social networks such as LinkedIn. Where users of those websites have made their personally-identifiable information publically available, McKinsey sometimes collects this information for the McKinsey Retention Program. If you do not want McKinsey to retain your personally-identifiable information collected in this way, please opt-out of the McKinsey Retention Program when notified that your personally-identifiable information has been collected.

###### Mobile Applications

In connection with applications that we make available for mobile devices, McKinsey may use third-party services to track and analyze nonpersonally identifiable user activity in order to fix errors, monitor usage, and improve the performance of the applications. In particular, UrbanAirship tracks whether a user opened an application in response to a specific push notification. Omniture tracks and reports on some of our mobile applications’ usage and browsing patterns, including information about the type of device used, articles accessed, and other events occurring within our apps. Crittercism tracks certain errors occurring within mobile applications. None of these third parties gathers information in a manner intended to identify any particular user personally.

In addition, our McKinsey Insights app offers a personalized list of recommendations (called “Recommended for you”) pointing out McKinsey content we think you'll find interesting. Recommendations are based solely on what you've viewed in the Insights app. A unique user identifier that is generated by the app  helps by personalizing your experience and tracking the articles you read. We do not share your viewing history or trends with other users or any third parties.

Our mobile applications may include integration with various social-networking sites, including Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, and Twitter. If you enable and use these features within an application, the extent to which your activities and information are tracked is governed by the relevant user agreement you have in place with such a third party.

###### The Alumni Center, Newsletters, and Alerts 

By registering with our Alumni Center or for recurring McKinsey newsletters or alerts, you agree to receive on occasion other correspondence from McKinsey related to the subscribed newsletters and other McKinsey news and information that you consented to receive during registration. This type of information is shared externally only in anonymous, aggregated form for generalized user analysis or to enable third party agents to send e-mails to you on our behalf. You will be contacted by e-mail or otherwise only by McKinsey or it agents. 

We ask for your e-mail address at registration. We will send e-mails to this address to confirm your registration, to provide newsletters or alerts and to contact you for any other reason. In addition, we may contact you regarding your account status. If you sign up to receive any of our newsletters, alerts, or surveys, you may on occasion receive other correspondence from McKinsey. Your e-mail address will not be shared with any third party other than an agent who has agreed to send e-mails on our behalf.

McKinsey is aware that the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks may, in light of a 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice, no longer constitute an adequate basis for the transfer of personal information to the United States. Nevertheless, McKinsey also believes that the Safe Harbor principles continue to represent important commitments for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and McKinsey will continue to abide by these principles in the course of the specific services covered by its Safe Harbor certification, as well as with any other commitments made to its clients.
