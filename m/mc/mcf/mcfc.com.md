You can use our websites without providing us with any of your personal information. If you do provide us with your personal information we will use it as set out on the website. For example if you sign up to get the newsletter, we will use your email address to send you the newsletter and news, updates and promotions we think you might like.

If you are under 12, and register on www.mancity.com we will not send you any emails or sms until after your 12th birthday. After your 12th birthday we will email to let you know how we are going to get in contact with you about Man City and our exciting news, features and activities. We encourage you to talk with your parent/guardian about the information we send to you, and check that they are happy for you to continue to receive this information.

Things work slightly differently on our Junior Cityzens website https://juniorcityzens.mcfc.co.uk, the same rules apply to the personal information we collect about you – we will use for the purposes we have told you about when we collect your information. But if you are under 12, when you sign up we ask you for your parent/guardian's email address so we can let them know you are registering on Junior Cityzens. If you are aged 12 to 13, we ask that you check with your parent/guardian before signing up and then let us know that they are happy for you to do so.

We make sure that any information or marketing that we send to under 18's is always age appropriate. If you have any concerns about the information your child is receiving, please contact us on [http://mcfc.force.com/help](http://mcfc.force.com/help).
