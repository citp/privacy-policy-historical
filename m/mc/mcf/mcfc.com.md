### Privacy Policy

This privacy policy and cookie policy set out below forms part of these terms of use and sets out the way in which your personal data are handled. Therefore please read this policy carefully, as it explains what information we will collect about you, how we will use it, and the steps we take to ensure that it is kept safe. 

  * #### What information do we collect?

In order to provide you with our services, we may collect personal information about you from our website, telephone conversations, emails, and written and verbal communications. We may, for example, keep a record of your name, address, delivery address, email address, telephone number and credit card details. We may also record details of any disability or health needs you may have at the time of booking an event or service to help to ensure your safety.

Information related to your visit to our website (such as which pages you visit, how often you visit and which competitions you enter) and the information you supply when becoming a registered user or when entering our competitions (such as your name and e-mail address) will be held and stored worldwide by us, and selected third parties.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we receive from third parties.

  * #### How do we use your information?

Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy.

We will primarily use your personal information to provide our services and products to you. We will also use the personal information that we hold to communicate with you, for example: in the event that the services or products you have requested are unavailable; for record keeping purposes; to recover debt and to help us to prevent fraud; to improve the quality of our service; for market research; or to track activity on our website. If you have changed the settings in your personal profile to reflect your wishes in this respect we may also create an individual profile for you so that we can inform you of services, products, events or special offers that may be of interest to you.

By supplying your information to us you confirm that you do not consider use of your information in accordance with this privacy policy to be a breach of any of your rights under the privacy and electronic communications (ec directive) regulations 2003.

  * #### Disclosure of your information

If you change the settings in your personal profile to reflect your wishes in this respect, your personal information (including details of your purchasing preferences) may be shared with reputable third parties whose products/services we think will be of interest to you and those third parties may contact you directly to tell you about the products/information or we may contact you on their behalf. Each of these third parties may use your information as described under the section "how do we use your information?" 

  * #### Use of your information outside the european economic area

In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to store or transfer your personal information to countries outside the european economic area, some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the united kingdom. This will include the holding of your personal data on the servers which host the website and which are located in the us. 

  * #### What to do if you do not want to receive marketing information

You have the right to prevent marketing information being sent direct to you. If you prefer not to receive information from us or from any other organisation to which we may disclose your personal information, you can write to us by mail or email (see the section "how to contact us" below) or by modifying the settings on your personal profile section during the registration process or at any other time. Please note, however, that if you do withhold or withdraw your consent, we and/or they will be unable to keep you informed of new services, products, events or special offers that may interest you. 

  * ####  Cookies Policy

Since May 26th 2011, the law states that cookies on websites can only be used with your specific consent. This will come in to action as of May 26th 2012. MCFC is currently formulating the best way to obtain your consent without compromising your enjoyment of the site. We will update you with this information once it is finalised. MCFC uses cookies in the operation of the site in a number of areas. If you choose not to accept our cookies, some services on our site will not be available to you.

**a. What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small file of data, often incorporating a unique identifier, that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a website's computer. This data file stores the information you provide us with and in doing so enables us to 'remember' you on repeat visit, effectively letting you move around the site without having to keep reintroducing yourself. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can set your browser to prevent this. If your browser’s preferences allow it, each website or third party service provider is able to send a cookie to your browser. However, to protect your privacy, your browser only allows these websites or third party service providers to access cookies already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers. 

Cookies record information about your online preferences, which are then used to tailor the MCFC website to your individual preferences. You can set your devices to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time.

For more information please see: <http://www.ico.gov.uk/>

MCFC does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you as a user of the site. However if you wish to restrict or block the cookies we use on MCFC you can do this within your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how to do this. 

For more information please see: <http://www.ico.gov.uk/>

They gather information regarding the visitors to the MCFC website using cookies, log file data and code embedded on our website. MCFC uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users; however, we demand that third parties do not use any of this type of information for their own business or other purposes. 

MCFC does contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of any personal information you submit or which is collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites.
