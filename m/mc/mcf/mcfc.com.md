Sometimes, specific products and services, such as apps, may be offered by different entities in the City Football Group, in which case the entity providing the product or service will be the data controller, so you should check the individual privacy information published with each service.

You can exercise control over some of this information, for example by adjusting your preferences for an app in your smartphone, or adjusting your settings via your website browser. Please also see our cookies policy [here.](http://www.mancity.com/en/common/cookies)

From our commercial partners and other third parties, we may collect information including your name, date of birth and contact information, when you enter into jointly conducted competitions and promotions, or purchase our products or services via a third party site. 

We use specialist data enrichment providers to assist us with enriching the data we hold on you. This includes helping us to review, segment and correct the data we hold, to make sure it remains accurate and up-to date and help us to identify and delete data we no longer need. This also helps us to understand your interests and preferences, so we can provide you with information which is likely to be most relevant to you and improve your experience of our products and services. You can visit their websites and view their Privacy Policies using the links below. 

**What special category information do you collect about me?**

We may record details of any disability or health needs you may have at the time of booking an event or service to help us make reasonable adjustments for you and to ensure your safety. We will usually ask your consent to do this, unless there are other legal grounds on which we need to use the information. 

In some limited circumstances, we may process information about criminal convictions, where this is necessary for public order and the prevention of crime, and there are adequate protections in place. 

**Why do we collect and use this information and what are the legal grounds for us doing so?**

We collect this information to (i) provide you with products and services you request; (ii) make our website available and improve its performance and presentation; (iii) to improve and enhance our services and make them more personal to you; (iv) to provide consistency when using the services offered to you by companies in our group; (v) to administer competitions and prize draws you enter; (vi) for the purposes of undertaking our business; and (vii) safety and public order and the prevention of crime. 

The legal grounds for this processing are: 

  * our legitimate interests (in carrying on our business, making our website available, and providing our customers with content which is appropriate for them);
  * for the performance of our contract with you (where you purchase goods or services from us or via a third party partner or one of the members of our group);
  * to comply with our legal obligations (for example, where we are required to record information in relation to health and safety, or safety and public order at match days as well as age sensitive content). 



In respect of limited categories of data we may record and use this with your consent (for example, in relation to sending you direct marketing). You can withdraw your consent at any time but this will not affect any processing undertaken before that point.

Where we develop a new feature or product (such as an updated ticketing website), if a separate account is required to access this we may for your convenience automatically create a new account for you using the details associated with your existing account. In this case we will email you to let you know.

By opting in it means that we will let you know about exciting promotions, news, features and activities of Man City, the City Football Group and/or our commercial partners. 

When we refer to the City Football Group, we are referring to the other companies that form part of our corporate group. Some of these companies may be involved in helping to provide the services and communications referred to in this privacy policy, or as requested by you from time to time. 

We may also use the personal information we collect about you to create statistics and anonymised information to then share with third parties including ad networks, search engines and analytics providers. 

Certain parts of our websites and apps may allow you to share information with other users. For example we may offer you the opportunity to create a “fan profile” containing basic personal information about you such as your first name, avatar, general location and social media handles, or, where there is a competition element, we may show scoreboards or basic details relating to the winner(s) of the competition. We will always make it clear where your personal information may be shared with other users in this way and you should only provide personal information to those parts of our sites and apps where you are comfortable with it being shared in this way. 

We may share your information with business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you. 

We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances: 

  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
  * If Man City or any other members of the City Football Group or substantially all of their assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by them about their customers will be one of the transferred assets.
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order: to comply with any legal obligation, court or police request, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use [ https://www.mancity.com/en/common/terms](https://www.mancity.com/en/common/terms) or terms and conditions of sale [ https://www.mancity.com/ticket-information/terms-and-conditions](https://www.mancity.com/ticket-information/terms-and-conditions) and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Man City and the City Football Group, our customers, or others.

We may share your information with selected third parties including:

  


  * Business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you.
  * Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others.
  * Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our sites and apps.



**Will we transfer your data outside of the EEA?**

We may sometimes have to transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). However, we will only do so where there are adequate safeguards in place or it is otherwise lawful. 

In some circumstances, we may need to transfer your personal information to countries outside the EEA, some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. In order for the transfer to be lawful, we must ensure adequate safeguards are in place. 

Where we transfer your data to a third party outside of the EEA (such as another company in our group) we will either: 

  * do so where there has been a finding of adequacy in respect of that territory, including under a recognised scheme (such as the US Privacy Shield); or
  * implement model contract clauses governing the transfer, as approved by the European Commission.



The only circumstances in which we may transfer data outside of the EEA outside of the above circumstances are:

  * where you have given your explicit consent (having had the risks explained to you);
  * where the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or with a third party in your interest;
  * the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;



For more information please contact us. 

**Will your information be used for profiling and automated decision taking?**

We may sometimes have to transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). However, we will only do so where there are adequate safeguards in place or it is otherwise lawful. 

We may use your data for profiling and limited automated decision taking, for example matching unique identifiers in our database (e.g. email address) with the same unique identifiers on social media platforms. In practice, the personal data is anonymised. Additionally, there are a variety of web analytics tools that we use (e.g. Google Analytics and Facebook Analytics). These platforms use a level of processing unique identifiers (e.g. IP address, Mac address, user ID, social handle, cookies) to track digital behaviours. 

**Will your information be secure?**

We take the security of your personal information seriously and take steps (including the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures) to ensure your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

Your information is kept on secure servers and we implement a range of measures to try to ensure the security and integrity of our digital products, services and databases. We take steps to ensure that only authorised persons have access to your data. 

When you submit your payment card details, we use industry standard secure sockets layer (ssl) encryption technology to guard your information. However, we cannot guarantee that any data transmission over the internet is completely secure. 

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites or apps, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

Our websites and apps may contain links to other websites. We are only responsible for the privacy practices on our websites and in our apps. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies and procedures of each and every other website that you visit. 

**How long will you keep my information?**

We will keep your information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes that we collected it for. However, we take steps to regularly review our information ensure that we are not holding excessive personal information for longer than is necessary or required. 

The factors which influence how long we hold onto specific information for include (i) legal requirements; (ii) managing our legal risks; (iii) management of our business; and (iv) the nature of our relationship with you (and the services we provide you with). 

Where you enter into a contract with us (such as for the purchase of goods or services) we will generally keep your information for six years after the end of our contract with you. 

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy. You can find out more by contacting us. 

**What rights do you have in relation to your personal information?**

Under data protection legislation you have a range of rights. You have a right to ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you. You can also ask us to correct or update your personal data, or to erase it or transfer it to a third party. You can object to processing of your personal information by us, including to object to any direct marketing. Where we are using your information based on your consent you can withdraw your consent. 

The way some of your rights apply may depend on the circumstances. To exercise your rights please contact us. Further information about your rights is set out below.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

**Info for kids**

This is a child-friendly explanation of how we use information. You should read it with a parent, guardian or other adult so that they can help you understand. 

When you: 

  * look at our website (including the videos and games); 
  * download one of our apps;
  * contact us; or
  * create an account with us 



We collect some information about you (like your name, or information about the tablet or computer you are using). 

We do this because we need to so we can carry on making our apps, website and our other services better. We make sure we use as little personal information as possible and only for as long as we need to. We will only keep your information as long as you need it. You can ask us for a copy of your information, or to correct, erase or stop using it. We will do our best to keep your information safe. 

For some uses of your personal information we may ask your permission. If you are aged 13 or over, you can give your permission yourself. If you are aged under 13 we require the consent of your parent or guardian. 

For each child-friendly app we operate, we include specific details of how we will use your information and why in a "Privacy Policy". For example, if you sign up to use The City Kids App and Website, the Privacy Policy 

You can use certain parts of our websites and apps without providing us with any of your personal information. If you do provide us with your personal information we will use it as set out on the relevant website or in the relevant app. For example if you sign up to get the newsletter, we will use your email address to send you the newsletter and news, updates and promotions we think you might like. 

If you are under 13 and register on [ https://www.mancity.com](https://www.mancity.com/) we will not send you any emails or SMS until after your 13th birthday. However, you should still decide when you register what type of emails and SMS you want to receive from us when you reach your 13th birthday and tick or untick the box or boxes on the registration form to tell us your preferences. If you decide to receive updates from us then after your 13th birthday we will email to let you know how we are going to get in contact with you about Man City and our exciting news, features and activities. We encourage you to talk with your parent/guardian about the information we send to you, and check that they are happy for you to continue to receive this information. If you do not tell us you do not want to receive this information any more, we will assume you have your parent and/or guardian's consent to continue to receive this information. 

You can ask us to stop sending you any emails, SMS or other communications at any time. In each message we send you there will be an 'unsubscribe' option, if you follow these instructions we will stop sending the messages. You can also send us a message to [ http://mcfc.force.com/help](http://mcfc.force.com/help) if you have any questions, want us to stop sending you messages or want to change any of the information you have given to us. 

If you are a parent or guardian of a child who is using www.mancity.com or otherwise in contact with us, we recommend that you supervise your child while they are online and check what personal information your child is providing to us. 

Things work slightly differently on our Junior Cityzens website [https://juniorcityzens.mcfc.co.uk](https://juniorcityzens.mcfc.co.uk/), the same rules apply to the personal information we collect about you – we will use for the purposes we have told you about when we collect your information. But if you are under 12, when you sign up we ask you for your parent/guardian's email address so we can let them know you are registering on Junior Cityzens. If you are aged 12 to 13, we ask that you check with your parent/guardian before signing up and then let us know that they are happy for you to do so. 

We make sure that any information or marketing that we send to under 18s is always age appropriate. If you have any concerns about the information your child is receiving, please contact us on [ http://mcfc.force.com/help](http://mcfc.force.com/help).
