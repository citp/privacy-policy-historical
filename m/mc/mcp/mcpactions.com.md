####  **Who Is This Policy Addressed To?**

For the purpose of data protection legislation (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’)), the data controller of your personal data is **MCPActions** (4000 4th Street, Moosic PA, 18517).

When we refer in this policy to ‘you’, we are referring to a customer of our products and services, or a person visiting our website. 

If you and wish to cease receiving emails from MCPActions.com, please unsubscribe directly using the unsubscribe link in the email message, or contact the us directly at support@mcpactions.com.

If you make a direct request to be removed from the MCPActions marketing list, we will do so promptly, while providing notice to you. You will still remain a contact/customer of our store unless you also request to be removed from our store database. 

**Information We May Collect From You**

We may collect and process the following data about you:

  * Information that you provide to us. You may give us your information by filling in forms on our website or by corresponding with us by email, live chat, phone or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use our website, respond to any surveys that we send to you to complete, and when you contact us for any reason. When you register for our site we will collect your username, name, email, password, address, and IP address. If you contact us, we may keep a record of any information contained in the correspondence.
  * With regard to each of your visits to our website, we will collect your IP address. This information is used for fraud and abuse detection. We also collect data from you for the purposes of retargeting – see the ‘Retargeting’ section below.
  * Payment information: When using our paid service, you will be asked for financial details such as credit/debit card information. The processing of these payments is carried out by our payment processors, Stripe and PayPal. We do not store any credit or debit card information on our servers. Stripe and PayPal have been audited by a PCI-certified auditor, and are certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. (This is the most stringent level of certification available). Their security assurances and Privacy Policies are available on their websites.



####  **How We Use Your Personal Information**

We use information held about you for the following purposes:

  * to provide you with information or products that you request from us, including responding to any requests for assistance with our products;
  * to send you newsletters about our products, news, specials, and notify you about any changes to our website;
  * to administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting;
  * as part of our efforts to keep our website safe and secure and to monitor actual or suspected fraudulent activity;
  * and to carry out retargeting advertising (see “Retargeting” section below).



####  **Retargeting**

Our website uses retargeted advertising provided by Facebook and Google. As a result of this retargeting, you may see ads for our services on other sites such as Facebook.

This happens in one of two ways:

  1. Our retargeting provider will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they will place an anonymous cookie or ‘pixel’ in your browser when you visit our site. This can only happen if your browser is set to let it happen – you can control your settings in your browser to stop this.
  2. We will use your email address to match MCPActions ads to you when you browse other sites. This involves us sharing your email address with Facebook and Google. This form of retargeting is generally used to update you on new product added to the MCPActions website.



Similarly, we may also share your email with Facebook and Google to ensure that we don’t present some MCPActions ads to you, our existing customers.

####  **Where We Store Your Personal Data**

 **This is only in reference to your MCPActions account profile data** , not your store data.

We take security very seriously, but as with any online service, despite our use of leading security tools and techniques, the personal data we hold about you can never be 100% immune from unauthorized access.

####  **Retention Of Your Personal Information**

The periods for which we keep your information depend on why your information was collected and what we use it for. We will not keep your personal information for longer than necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.

####  **Legal Basis For Processing**

We are required to state the legal basis on which we undertake processing of your personal information. We will only use your information where:

If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw that consent at any time.

  * verify that you are the party that you’re requesting the data of; and
