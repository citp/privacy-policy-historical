### Third-Party Links and Content

Our services and communications may contain links to or content from websites or other online services provided by third parties. We expect our partners and third-party providers to respect your privacy, but you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by websites and other services that are not under our control. The privacy practices of third parties are governed by their privacy policies, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of all websites and online services that you use, view, or visit.

### Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies

We may use cookies, web beacons (also known as pixels), and other technologies to collect information when you use our services.

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website stores on your computer or device in the cookie file associated with the browser that you use to access the website. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies alone generally cannot be used to identify you. But if you choose the "Remember Me" feature or similar features, a cookie will store information that helps remember you, such as your username.

Cookies help us recognize you when you return to our websites and hold information from one visit to the next for your ease of use. Cookies also help us better understand how people use our services through click-stream analysis. Further information on our use of cookies, including how to disable them or register your preferences regarding their use is contained in the Interest Based Advertising section of this Privacy Policy.

Third-party content providers, advertisers, and advertising companies may place cookies on your computer or mobile device. Those cookies are controlled by the third parties and are not governed by this Privacy Policy. For information on how to disable third-party cookies and how to register your preferences regarding the use of some third-party cookies, see the Interest Based Advertising section of this Privacy Policy.

We and some of our advertisers work with ad networks and ad delivery platforms that place retargeting pixels on users' computers to gather information about users' online activities, such as browsing histories and demographic information. This information can be aggregated into audience segments, which help deliver relevant advertising to users visiting our websites and third-party websites that use the same pixels.

Some of our services and communications may contain tiny electronic images known as web beacons. We use web beacons to assist us in delivering cookies on our services and to allow us to count users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

### Interest-Based Advertising

To help ensure that you receive ads that are relevant to your interests on our services, our advertisers' services, and elsewhere on the Internet, we and third-parties (including service providers, advertisers, and advertising companies) may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and apps. We and third parties may use that information to help understand audience segments. Advertisers may use the segments to determine the audience groups to which they wish to deliver particular ads. Through this process, we do not use information that directly identifies you.

You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from some companies, including us and our service providers, by visiting the following sites: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>, <http://choices.ghosteryenterprise.com/global-opt-out.html>, and <https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>. Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive advertising. It means that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

If you do not wish to allow cookies to be placed on your computer or device, you can configure your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.) to delete and/or control the use of cookies. Please note that the interest-based advertising opt outs provided in the links above rely on the use of cookies. If you disable or delete cookies, you may remove your opt-out preferences. Deleting and/or controlling the use of cookies AND visiting the opt-out links above to register your preferences will help to ensure that you do not receive interest-based advertising. Again, this does not mean that you will not receive ads, it simply means that you will not receive ads that are tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not respond to browser Do Not Track signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate; if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so here. For more information on Do Not Track, please visit [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com/).

### Children's Privacy

We care about children's privacy. Our services are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age. We will not knowingly allow children under 13 to register for or become members of our services. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 13, we will take reasonable steps to promptly delete that information. If you believe we have collected information from anyone under 13 without parental consent, please contact us via any of the channels listed below.

### Your Choices

In general, if you register to use any of our services, you may update the information you have provided to us for any of our services by visiting the account information page of that service.

When you register for our services, you may be able to indicate your preferences regarding marketing communications. In the Newsletter Member Center of our services, you may be able to change those preferences and select the categories of communications that interest you. When we or our affiliates send you emails containing offers that may be of interest of you, those emails may contain links via which you may opt out of receiving those communications.

You will not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service-related or transactional communications relating to our services unless you cancel your registration or membership.

You can delete accounts associated with our services by visiting the appropriate account information page for that service and clicking on the link "delete my account." When you do so, we will delete your information from our servers except for a transactional record of your account. Some information may remain on back-up media. Deleting your account cancels your membership and you may no longer be able to access some of our services or some of the features or content offered by our services. If you need assistance locating the account information page for any service, or updating or deleting the information you have provided in connection with the service, please contact us as set forth below.

### Security

While we strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information, no information system can be 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we cannot be responsible for information that you transmit over networks that we do not control or information that you choose to publicly disclose. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information.

We make reasonable efforts to secure the account information pages and other registration locations for our services, such that they can be accessed only by our authorized personnel or by logging in with your member name and password.

We endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using technology that encrypts information you submit.

### Definition of Certain Terms

IP Address- the identifier assigned to facilitate communications over the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet. An IP address does not in and of itself disclose your name, email address, or home or work address.

Service Providers- unaffiliated companies that perform services on our behalf, such as printing, mailing, processing payments, managing the delivery of advertisements, collections, data processing, or communications. We strive to limit the amount of users' personally identifiable information shared with service providers. We ask these service providers to keep confidential the information that we provide to them, and we require them to not share, sell, or rent any information collected from our users that directly identifies our users.
