# McCormick - Privacy Policy

This site is owned and operated by **McCormick & Company, Inc.** We at McCormick recognize that many consumers are concerned about their personal privacy. This privacy policy is provided to inform you of what personal information is collected at our site, and how it is maintained and used by McCormick. These practices may be updated periodically, by posting them to our website, so we encourage you to review the privacy policy from time to time.

**What information do we collect?** You don't need to provide any personal information to access our site. However, McCormick provides you the opportunity to enhance your visit to our site by collecting information about your preferences and therefore providing content that is more relevant to you, for example in the "May We Suggest" area. McCormick may also use information about your preferences in order to send you e-mail with information that may interest you.

**All personal information is collected voluntarily.** We will never share personally-identifiable information about you without your prior consent. Like many companies, however, we may share aggregate information about people who use our site (for example, number of males & females) to business partners and other third parties.

If we collect personal information from you for a promotion (for example, your address or phone number), we will use it for the purpose of conducting the promotion. We won't share it with anyone outside McCormick.

**Access to your personal information:** You always have access to the information we have about you. To review and update your personal contact information, simply go to www.mccormick.com/mymcsignin.cfm.

**Security:** McCormick's website employs appropriate security measures which are designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of any personally-identifiable information.

**Note to Parents:** We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. Parents may always ask to review any personal information we have collected from their children. You may have information related to your child deleted from the database and refuse to permit further collection or use of children's information.

**Cookies:** Like many companies, we use "cookie" technology on our website to enhance your experience. If you've registered for our site, cookies tell us whether you've been to the site before, and help identify information you've already viewed on the site or information that would be of most interest to you. The cookie itself does not obtain any personal information from you or extract any information from your computer.

**Links to other sites:** McCormick's website contains links to other sites. McCormick does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

**Changes to this policy:** If there are revisions or additions to McCormick's Privacy Policy, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how it is used, and what choices you have.
