**_Cookies_** **.** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to manage how websites place cookies through your browser. 

_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies_ . Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites and App to, among other things, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded. 

**_Local Storage Objects_** . We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.

Accordingly, usage data is shared with[Google](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2) and [ClickDimensions](http://www.clickdimensions.com/about/privacy-policy), each of which have their own privacy policy addressing how they such information and any choices you may have about their collection and use of information. We encourage you to review these privacy policies. 

**_Targeted_** __ **_Advertising_** __ **_and_** __ **_Ad_** __ **_Networks_** **.** We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities on our Sites and in the Apps. We may also participate in third party ad networks (including but not limited to [Google Ads](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) and Facebook Ads) and allow third parties to use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies on the Sites to collect usage information and display targeted ads; these third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources.

Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.
