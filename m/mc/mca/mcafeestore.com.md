We collect only the following information about our users: name, email address, ZIP Code, state, and country. We use the name and email address to manage registrations. We do not sell or distribute that information to any third party. We do not reveal your email address or other personal information, except to complete transactions with our third party suppliers.

**Use of Your Email Address**

If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we will occasionally send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from third parties. At the time that you register or make a purchase, you will be given an opportunity to opt out of this service.

TRUSTe is currently developing a program to address the collection of data through downloadable consumer software.
