  * Intel Account ID
  * Profile picture 
  * Social media postings and information
  * Payment card, digital wallet, or other payment service information
  * Depending on the service we are providing to you we may also need to collect more sensitive personal information (such as location, government-issued identification, photographs, audio/video recordings, images, and biometrics) directly from you



If you submit any personal information about other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use their personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

We and our service providers may collect personal information from a variety of sources, including:

  * **From you or someone acting on your behalf** : We may collect personal information you or someone acting on your behalf shares with us such as your name and contact details.
  * **Through the Intel Services** : We may collect personal information about you when you use Intel Services, for example, when you sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or use or install our products or apps.
  * **Through Third Parties’ Services** : We may collect personal information about you when you use third party services that utilize the Intel Services.
  * **Offline** : We may collect personal information you provide to us offline, such as when you visit our stores, attend one of our trade shows or events, place a verbal order over the phone or contact customer services. 
  * **From Other Sources** : We may collect your personal information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and social media platforms. We may also receive your personal information from people with whom you are "friends" or otherwise connected on social media platforms. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Intel Services account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us. Such information may include personal information that is part of your social media profile or your friends’ profiles. Similarly, if your social media "friends" connect their social media account to their Intel Services account, information about you may be shared with us via this “friend” connection.



**Other Information We May Collect**   
Intel may also collect other information from your app, browser, or device that does not reveal your (or anyone else's) real world identity, for example:

  * Browser and device information
  * App or device usage data
  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies
  * IP address
  * Location data
  * Aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information 
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you (i.e., language, occupation, postal code). 



We and our third-party service providers may collect this information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through your browser or device** : Most browsers and devices collect certain information automatically, for example, type and version of operating system, screen resolution, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Intel Services (such as the app) you are using. We use this information, for example, to make sure that the Intel Services function properly, analyze the performance of our products, and improve and maintain the Intel Services.
  * **Through your use of an Intel app** : When you download and use an Intel app, we and our service providers may track and collect usage data, such as the date and time the Intel app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Intel app.

Technologies similar to cookies are also used in connection with some Intel Services, such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage. Please view our [Intel Cookies and Similar Technologies Notice](https://web.archive.org/common/privacy/english/index.htm#ht=tab3) for more information and how to disable/remove certain cookies. 
  * **IP Address** : IP addresses are automatically transmitted as part of any Internet communication, and collecting IP addresses is a common practice; many web sites, applications and other Intel Services collect IP addresses automatically. We use IP addresses for purposes such as communicating with your device, calculating usage levels of the Intel Services, helping diagnose server problems, security, and administering the Intel Services. **Location Data:**  We may collect the physical location of a connected device, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, and WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based Intel Services, content, and advertising. We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. You can choose whether to allow or deny uses and/or sharing of your device’s location by changing your device settings, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized Intel Services, content, and advertising.

## Intel Cookies and Similar Technologies Notice

Our Sites (as defined below) use Cookies and Similar Technologies to ensure that we give our visitors the best possible experience by providing you personalized information, remembering your marketing and product preferences, and helping you obtain the right information. You can find out more about Cookies and Similar Technologies, how we use them, and [how to control them](https://web.archive.org/common/privacy/english/index.htm#ht=tab3) below.

**Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies**  
This Notice describes how Intel, our partners, and our other third parties use Cookies and Similar Technologies (such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage). We will refer to these Cookies and Similar Technologies simply as “Cookies” for the rest of Notice. We will also describe what options you may have regarding those Cookies. This Notice covers Intel’s use of Cookies that may be used in connection with the web sites (including mobile web sites and apps) owned and controlled by Intel (the “Sites”).

In some cases, we may use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information. In such cases, the [Intel Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/common/privacy/english/index.htm#ht=tab2) will apply in addition to this Intel Notice.

**What are Cookies and Similar Technologies?**  
Cookies are small files—usually consisting of letters and numbers—placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device, when you use that device to visit a web site. Cookies are widely used by web site owners to make their web sites operate, work more efficiently, and provide analytic information.

These are the different types of Cookies we and our service providers may use on our Sites:

  * **Essential Cookies.**  These Cookies are required for the operation of our Sites (for example, to enable you to log into secure areas of our web site or use a shopping cart). These Cookies enable you to move around the Sites and use their features. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Sites’ performance and may make the features and service unavailable. 
  * **Analytics and Customization Cookies.**  These Cookies allow us to analyze activities on our Sites and on other sites where we post content in order to improve and optimize the way our Sites work. For example, we may use these types of Cookies to ensure that visitors can easily find the information they are looking for on our web sites. One way we do this is to recognize and count the number of visitors and see how they move around our web site when they are using it. Analytics cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our advertising campaigns and to optimize our Sites’ content for those who engage with our advertising. 
  * **Functionality Cookies**. These Cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
  * **Advertising Cookies.**  These Cookies record your online activities, including your visits to our Sites, the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked. One purpose of this is to help make the content displayed on our Sites more relevant to you. Another purpose is to allow us and our service providers to deliver advertisements or other communications to you that are designed to be more relevant to your apparent interests. When we and our service providers do so, this also involves partners such as publishers, data management platforms, and demand side platforms that help to manage the data. For example, if you look at one page on one of our Sites, we may cause an advertisement to be delivered to you, on our Sites or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We and our service providers and partners may also append other data to information collected by these Cookies, including information obtained from third parties, and share this information with third parties for the purpose of delivering ads to you.



**How does Intel Collect and Use Other Information?**  
We and our service providers may use Cookies for a variety of purposes, including to:

  * Help us and third parties obtain information about your visits to the Sites;
  * Process your orders;
  * Analyze your visiting patterns to improve our Sites;
  * Deliver advertising, communications, and content from us and third parties, on our Sites and those of third parties, specific to your interests;
  * Remember your language and other preferences;
  * Help you obtain information you are looking for;
  * Provide a safe and secure service for online transactions;
  * Measure how many people use our Sites, and how they use them, to keep our Sites running efficiently and to better understand our Sites’ audiences.
  * If you register on one of our Sites, or otherwise provide us with your personal information, we may associate that information with other information we collect from or about you or that you provide, information regarding your use of our Sites, or information we receive from or about you from third parties. We will use this combined data for marketing and analytics purposes.



**How Long do Cookies Stay on My Device?**  
Other Cookies operate from the time you visit an Intel service to the end of that particular web browsing session. These Cookies expire and are automatically deleted when you close your Internet browser. These Cookies are called “session” Cookies.

Some Cookies will stay on your device between browsing sessions—they do not expire when you close your browser. These Cookies are called “persistent” Cookies. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We and others use persistent Cookies for a variety of purposes, such as to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Sites, how often you return, how your use of the Sites may vary over time, and the effectiveness of advertising efforts.

**Who Puts the Cookies on My Device?**  
Cookies may be placed on your device by Intel as the Site operator. These Cookies are called “first party” Cookies. Some Cookies may be placed on your device by a party other than Intel. These Cookies are called “third party” Cookies. For example, an Intel partner may place a third party Cookie to enable online chat services.

Cookies may also be used that allow us and third parties to know when you visit our Sites, and to understand how you interact with e-mails, advertisements, or other content. Through Cookies, aggregate and other information not identifying individual users (such as your operating system, browser version, and the URL you came from, including from e-mails and advertisements) may be obtained and used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns. This technology counts the number of users who visit a particular service from specific banner advertisements outside the Intel Site or who clicked on links or graphics included in e-mail newsletters received from Intel. It is also used as a tool to compile aggregated statistics about how Intel Sites are used, to perform analytics and help us to optimize our Sites, and to help serve you advertising based on your interests, as described in further detail below.

**How does Intel Use Online and Mobile Advertising?**  
We and third parties, including technology partners, and service providers engage in interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and personalized content that we and other advertisers believe will be of interest to you. To the extent third party vendors are using Cookies to perform these services for Intel or others, Intel does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

Ads may be delivered to you based on your online or mobile behavior (on Intel Sites and non-Intel sites), your search activity, your responses to one of our advertisements or e-mails, the pages you visit, your general geographic location, or other information. These ads may appear on our Sites or on third party web sites. The technology partners with whom we work to help us conduct interest-based advertising may be members of self-regulatory associations such as the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)](http://www.aboutads.info/). For Sites directed at persons located in the European Union, we may work with technology partners who are members of the [European Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA)](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). You may also see advertisements for third parties on Intel Sites or other web sites or properties, based on your visits to, and activities on, Intel Sites and other sites.

**How do I Manage Cookies?**
