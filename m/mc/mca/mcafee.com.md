**We Protect Your Right to Privacy**   
McAfee.com respects your privacy. Our guidelines for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Web site appear below. Furthermore, McAfee.com is a registered licensee of TRUSTe. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of full disclosure and informed consent. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and to have our privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe. These include: 

  * What information we gather/track 
  * How we use the information

**Privacy Statement**   
This statement discloses the privacy practices for www.mcafee.com. We have designed McAfee.com so that no personal identifying information is displayed online or is accessible to the general public. 

**What Information We Gather/Track**   
We collect and store some or all of the following information about our users: name; email address; and billing information, such as address, phone number and credit card number. If you do not wish to have your credit card number stored, please contact [Customer Service](http://www.mcafee.com/support/cust_serv/ms_contact_options.asp?phone=1). We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies", and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses McAfee.com. 

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. You will have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information. 

**Use of Data**   
McAfee.com uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, including fulfillment of promotional offers, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, to personalize our web sites for you, and to manage and renew your subscription(s). Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission. 

**Web Applications**   
Certain online applications, such as the various elements of the McAfee.com Clinic, store some components on your hard drive. The software employs proprietary technology to scan your computer system and retrieve information regarding your installed software and hardware. The information that is retrieved is used to provide the services you have chosen to subscribe to or use. In addition, unless you indicate you do not want this service, the information will be used to generate advertising that is appropriate for you. The information gathered by these applications is used only to generate output directed to you and is not aggregated or used for any other purpose. It is not stored along with any identifying information about you, nor is it sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties in any form whatever. TRUSTe is currently developing a program to address the collection of data through downloadable consumer software. However, as this program is not yet ready for implementation, TRUSTe does not yet cover data collected in this manner. As soon this program is put in place, McAfee.com looks forward to working with TRUSTe to address this data practice. 

**Use of Your Email Address**   
If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we will occasionally send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from third parties. You may block future email of this type, simply by following the instructions at the bottom of the update messages. 

Separately, we send service notifications via email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. Therefore there is no opt-out available for service notifications and these messages cannot be blocked. These emails may also include paid advertisements from third parties. 

**Who We Share It With**   
McAfee.com will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other McAfee.com entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in "Use of Data". By contract, third parties such as CyberSource and Beyond.com must comply with their own privacy policies with regard to the renting, selling, or sharing of information. As partners of McAfee.com, they must also offer McAfee.com customers the chance to opt out of information sharing. For advertising purposes, visitor and customer information is statistically aggregated and reported to advertisers. However, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, account, password, or transaction history. 

**Special Relationships**   
McAfee.com has a number of relationships with business partners. These business partners provide a number of different services. 

CyberSource and Telecheck are intermediaries in the purchasing process for McAfee.com. CyberSource provides credit card transaction services for McAfee.com. Telecheck provides electronic check processing services for McAfee.com.

**Our Privacy Policy Regarding Children who Visit our Site**

**What Information Is Collected?**   
It's our policy to create website content that requires minimum collection of information from children visiting our site. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. a child's email address and/or email address of parent or guardian), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities. McAfee.com does not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

McAfee.com will not sell, rent, or lease this information to others. Unless required by law, we will only share the personal data provided online with other McAfee.com entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in "Use of Data" or for purposes of conducting a contest or sweepstakes. 

  * **Contests and Sweepstakes**   
McAfee.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a **child is asked to provide his or her first name, last name, email address and age. If the child is 13 years old or younger, the last name and the email address are deleted immediately**. He or she is also required to enter the name of a parent and the email address of a parent. We then send the child's parent an email within two business days informing him or her of the child's entry. **The parent must respond and approve the child's entry into the contest or the child's information will be deleted from our records**. All the information collected by McAfee.com is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes and notifying the winner(s). The parent will be notified if their child wins the contest if the child is under 13, otherwise the child will be contacted. Once the contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information collected. 

**Information for Parents**
