# McArthurGlen Designer Outlets | Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

This Site is controlled and operated by McArthurGlen UK Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "McArthurGlen", "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains what personally identifiable information is collected and recorded about you during your visit to this Site and what we do with that information. This Policy is incorporated into and forms part of the terms and conditions which apply to your use of the Site. Please read this Policy carefully before submitting any information.

**Your consent**

By accessing, browsing or otherwise using this Site, you agree and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Policy. Personal information is any information which identifies you including, for example, your name, email address, contact details etc..

**Active information collection**

McArthurGlen collects personal information that you voluntarily provide via the Site. For example, when registering with the Site we may ask you to provide your name, address, telephone numbers, email address and date of birth. This is not an exhaustive list and we may ask for additional information as relevant from time to time.

**Passive information collection**

As you navigate through the Site, certain information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as: (a) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and web logs; and (b) "cookies".

**Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and web logs**

An IP address is assigned to your computer each time that you access the Internet. This enables your computer to send and receive data. Generally, every time you connect to the Internet, your IP address changes. However, in some circumstances (i.e. with some broadband connections) your IP address is fixed. A fixed IP address can be associated with your particular computer and may, therefore, amount to your personal information.

Web log information is non-personal information that is collected by the computer that hosts the Site each time you visit. Examples of the type of information that can be collected using your IP address and/or web log information include details of the date and time that you visited the Site and the type of Internet browser and computer operating system that you used. We, or our authorised agents, use your IP address and/or web log information to collect and report aggregate information on how the Site is being used and ways in which the Site can be improved.

**Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small data file that is transferred by a website to the cookie file on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Click here to find out more about cookies. Two types of cookies are used on the Site: (a) "session" cookies - these are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Site; and (b) "persistent" cookies - these remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).

Session cookies are used to improve navigation around the Site and to collect aggregate statistical information. This aggregate statistical information is used for McArthurGlen's internal purposes only and will not be provided to third parties.

Persistent cookies are used on the Site to store information on your computer for a number of purposes. These include retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g. login and password details), helping to determine which areas of the Site you find most valuable and customising the Site based on your preferences.

**Use of your information**

We may use your personal information: (a) to respond to your questions or requests for additional information; (b) to provide you with information that you have specifically requested or that we have asked if you would like to receive; and (c) for internal analysis so that we can better understand how we can improve our Site, products and services.

In addition we may use your information to inform you from time to time of other products and/or services we offer which we consider may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive information in this way then you should leave the relevant box in the Site blank when we ask for your consent to do this. You may otherwise email us at any time at marketing@mcarthurglen.com to indicate that you do not want to receive information in this way from us.

**Sharing your information**

We may use third parties to perform functions on our behalf in relation to the Site and the purposes set out in this Policy (for example, website hosting). Such third parties may be provided with access to your personal information if needed to perform their specific functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.

In addition, where you have provided your consent to do so, we may share your personal information with carefully selected third parties so that they may send you information about special promotions and offers.

We may also share information about visitors to this Site in an anonymous or aggregate form with third parties including advertisers, business partners, and sponsors, to understand customer trends and patterns and manage and improve our business relationships.

It is possible that McArthurGlen could merge with or be acquired by another business or that the operation of the Site will be transferred or sub-contracted to another legal entity. To the extent legally permissible, we may share with, or otherwise transfer your personal information to, the resulting legal entity.

Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless: (a) we have informed you about the disclosure when you submitted your information to us and you consented to the disclosure; or (b) the disclosure is required or permitted by law or by court order.

**Security**

We take reasonable steps to protect your personally information as you visit and use the Site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result we cannot warrant the security of any information you provide to us and you do so at your own risk.

**Storage**

Your personal information is stored on secure servers maintained by McArthurGlen. Information collected from the use of the Site, including personal information, may be stored on secure servers located outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") in countries whose privacy laws are not as rigorous as those of the EEA. However, we always take steps to ensure the security of your data. By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to countries outside the EEA.

**Your rights**

If you would like to access the personally identifiable information we have collected about you via the Site, or if you would like to cancel, correct or update your information, you may: (a) email us at marketing@mcarthurglen.com; or (b) you can contact us by post at: Data Protection Officer, McArthurGlen UK Limited, Nations House, 3rd Floor, 103 Wigmore Street, London, W1U 1WH, United Kingdom.

To protect your privacy and security we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making any such cancellations, corrections or updates.

**Changes to this Policy**

We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time. Changes to this Policy will be posted on the Site. Your continued subscription to or use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of the Policy as revised. It is your responsibility to review the Policy frequently. Please contact us at marketing@mcarthurglen.com if you have any questions about this Policy.
