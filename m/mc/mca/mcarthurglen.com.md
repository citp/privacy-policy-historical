##### Cookies and Similar Technologies

We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. We aim to be as open and transparent as possible around the information we collect when you visit our Site, including through the use of "cookies".

This section explains what cookies are and how we use them. It also explains the different types of cookies we use, and how you can change or delete them. We hope that this helps you understand and feel more confident about our use of cookies. If you have any further queries, please contact _**Savannah Christensen, Data Protection Officer**_ , [compliance.officer@mcarthurglen.com](mailto:compliance.officer@mcarthurglen.com).

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which allows the server to uniquely identify the browser on each page.

We also use other tracking technologies, which are similar to cookies.  This can include pixel tags and tracking URLs.  All these technologies are together referred to in this Cookie Policy as “ **Cookies** ”.

**How do we use Cookies?**

The types of Cookies that we use on our Site, and the purposes for which they are used, are set out below.  Note that the Cookies we use are subject to change and that we endeavour to keep our Cookie list up to date.

  * **Strictly necessary cookies:** These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of our Site. Without these cookies, any services on our Site you wish to access cannot be provided.


  * **Analytical/performance cookies:** These cookies collect information about how you and other visitors use our Site, for instance which pages you go to most often, and if you get error messages from web pages. We use data from these cookies to help test designs and to ensure a consistent look and feel is maintained on your visit to the Site.  All information these cookies collect is aggregated. It is only used to improve how a website works.



We use Google Analytics, for example, to anonymously track website usage and activity. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“ **Google** ”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB>.

You can refuse the use of Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set on the computer, which prevents the future collection of your data when visiting this Site. <a href=“javascript:gaOptout()“>Disable Google Analytics</a>.

Further information concerning the terms and conditions of use and data privacy can be found at <http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html> or at <https://www.google.de/intl/en_uk/policies/>. Please note that on this website, Google Analytics code is supplemented by “ **anonymizeIp** ” to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called IP-masking).

  * **Functionality cookies:** These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting. Additionally, these cookies can be used to allow an optional service to function such as offering a live chat session.  The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.


  * **Targeting cookies:** These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.


  * **Social media cookies:** These cookies allow you to share what you’ve been doing on our Site on social media such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control.  Please refer to the respective privacy policies for how their cookies work.


  * **Pixel tags:** Also known as a clear GIF or web beacon. These are invisible tags placed on certain pages of our Site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.


  * **Tracking URLs:** These are used to determine from which referring website the Site is accessed.



We require your consent for the use of some Cookies. You can give your consent either by closing the cookie banner displayed on the landing page of our website or by browsing the Site outside the cookie banner and clicking on any of the items on the Site. Please note that we track your consent using a technical Cookie; therefore, in the event you delete any Cookies stored on your devices you will see the Cookie banner once again.

If you do not want to allow Cookies at all, or only want to allow use of certain Cookies, please refer to your browser settings. You can also use your browser settings to withdraw your consent to our use of Cookies at any time and delete Cookies that have already been set. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future Cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our Site.

##### Securing your Information

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information as you visit and use the Site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result we cannot warrant the security of any information you provide to us and you do so at your own risk.

##### Transferring your information

You understand and acknowledge that by using this Site, we collect and use personal information in the UK.  We transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”) to our Group Companies and to third parties, including to countries which have different data protection standards to those which apply in the EEA. Our Group Company locations are set out in the 'Our Group Companies' section below. Our service providers include locations in Australia and Canada.

Where service providers process your personal information in countries deemed adequate by the European Commission, we rely on the European Commission's decision to protect your personal information,

For transfers to Group Companies and service providers outside the EEA, we use standard contractual clauses or rely on a service provider's Privacy Shield certification or a service provider's (EU data protection authority approved) corporate rules that are in place to protect your personal information. You have a right to ask us for a copy of the standard contractual clauses or a copy of the other methods used (by contacting us as set out below).

##### Retaining your Data

We retain personal information used to send you direct marketing for as long as we can lawfully market to you. Where we no longer have grounds to market to you (e.g. because you opt-out) or the details we hold are no longer up-to-date (e.g. the email address we hold is invalid) we will delete personal information we hold about you from our marketing data base but retain some information on a 'suppression list' on an ongoing basis so we can manage your preferences going forward.

Personal information captured for competition purposes, or for the processing of gift cards, is cleansed regularly.

##### Legal basis for processing your information

We process your personal information with your consent when you agree that we may place Cookies, when you agree to receiving direct marketing or on other occasions where we ask you for consent, for the purpose which we explain at that time. Where we do process personal information based on consent, your consent is revocable at any time (without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal).

We process your personal information when we are required to do this by law, including in response to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation or court orders.

We process your personal information when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are the party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. This applies in any case where we provide or deliver products and services to you pursuant to a contract, such as when you purchase a gift card, process your registration on the Site or enter into a competition. If you do not provide the personal information that we need in order to provide or deliver the service, we will not be able to provide or deliver services to you.

We also process your personal information when it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by us or a third party (when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights).  

##### Your Rights

You may ask us for a copy of your information and, where applicable, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at your request. You also have rights to object to some processing and, where we have asked for your consent to process your personal information, to withdraw this consent. Where we process your personal information because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), you also have a right to object to this. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information.

We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your personal information. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to data protection authorities. You can bring the complaint in your member state of residence, place of work or where an alleged infringement of data protection law occurred.

To protect your privacy and security we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity when dealing with requests.

##### Wifi Policy

**Introduction**

This Annex to the Privacy & Cookies Policy (“ **Policy** ”) relates to your use of a WiFi service (the “ **WiFi Service** ”) which is provided by or on behalf of McArthurGlen UK Limited (referred to in this WiFi Annex as " **McArthurGlen** ", " **we** ", " **us** " or " **our** ") from our venues when you have applied to access or accessed the WiFi Service. This Annex, in addition to the Policy, explains in further detail how we use your personal information we collect and generate when you use the WiFi Service. 

For the purposes of this Annex, “ **Group Company** ” has the same meaning as set out in the Policy.

**Information we collect**

We collect, receive, store and process the following information about you:

  * information that you provide when registering for the WiFi Service (e.g. name, address, telephone numbers, email address and date of birth);
  * your device details and MAC address (see below for further information about MAC addresses);
  * details about when and where you connect to the WiFi Service including your venue location and the WiFi access point(s) where you are using the WiFi service. This data will be collected automatically by the wireless access point unless your phone/device is switched off or you have switched off WiFi on your phone/device; and
  * your communications with us in connection with the WiFi Service.



We will collect your personal information from you and from your use of the WiFi Service, from our WiFi providers and from social media providers if you register using a social media account.

A MAC address unique identifier for your device that tells us the make of a device e.g. Samsung or Apple, but it does not tell us your name or phone number, or allow us to access any data held on your device.  If your WiFi settings on your mobile device are turned on when you visit one of our locations (including the parking area but no further) then we automatically collect the MAC address from your device. We explain how we use MAC addresses in the next section.

**Use of your information**

In addition to the purposes described in the Policy, we use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to provide the WiFi service to you and to enable you to connect to the WiFi Service efficiently on return visits;
  * to respond to your questions, requests for additional information, enquiries or complains about the WiFi Service;
  * to communicate information about the WiFi Service to you, including changes to the WiFi Service;
  * to keep our WiFi Service secure and prevent fraud;
  * to monitor and analyse the use of the WiFi Services to prevent, investigate and/or report security incidents or crime;
  * to verify compliance with the terms and conditions governing the use of the WiFi Service; and
  * for research and analytics of use of the WiFi Service to identify general consumer trends, to understand better customer, consumer and social behaviours and to improve our products and services. We provide aggregated statistics about our sales, customers, traffic patterns to third parties for analytics purposes but these statistics will not include any information that is likely to identify you as an individual.



We use MAC addresses to determine your distance from WiFi sensors located across the location you are visiting.  We aggregate this information to create reports on the movement of visitors to our locations.  We use this information, for example, to optimise the layout of our locations, design marketing promotions, change staffing hours, or measure the impact of a campaign. You can opt out of having your location data collected at any time by visiting [http://optout.mcarthurglen.com](http://optout.mcarthurglen.com/). With your consent, we use your location data for the purpose of selecting and sending you marketing offers and alerts which might interest you during your visit to a location.

**Sharing your information**

In addition to the disclosures described in the Policy, we disclose or transfer personal information to third party service providers that perform functions on our behalf in relation to the WiFi Services and the purposes set out in this Annex and the Policy. Third party providers of analytics and reporting services include AM Networks Ltd, 77a Cheap Street, Sherborne, Dorset, DT9 3BA; Skyfii Group Pty Ltd, Darlinghurst, New South Wales 2010, Australia; and Aislelabs Inc, 210-43 Hanna Ave, Toronto ON, M6K 1X1, Canada.

If you would like a list of the third parties with whom we share personal information, please contact _**Savannah Christensen, Data Protection Officer,** _[compliance.officer@mcarthurglen.com](mailto:compliance.officer@mcarthurglen.com).

**Transfers**

_See the 'Transfers' section of the Policy._

**Retention**

We retain information that you provide when registering for the WiFi Service and your device details and MAC address for two years from collection.

**Legal basis for processing**

We process your personal information when we are required to do this by law, including in response to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation or court orders.

If it is mandatory for you to provide personal information, we will make this clear at the time and will also explain what will happen if you do not provide the information.

We process your personal information when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are the party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (for example, when we provide or deliver services to you pursuant to a contract). If you do not provide the personal information that we need in order to provide or deliver the WiFi Service, we will not be able to provide or deliver WiFi Services to you.

We process your personal information when it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by us or a third party (when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights).

Where we do process personal information based on consent, your consent is revocable at any time.

**Your rights**
