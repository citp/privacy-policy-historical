## **1\. Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used**

The information we collect fall into three categories:  
(a) Those you give us  
(b) Those we collect through automated means, and  
(c) Those we collect from other sources (collectively, the “ **Personal Data** “). 

Please note that we may combine all of these sources of information. 

###  **Information You Give Us.**

###  **Information from Automated Means**

When you visit, use or interact with our Sites or Mobile Apps, we may collect certain information by automated or passive means using a variety of technologies which may be downloaded to your device and may set or modify settings on your device. The “Usage Information“ we collect may include your Internet Protocol (“IP“) address, computer/mobile device operating system and browser type, type of mobile device, the characteristics of the mobile device, the unique device identifier (“UDID“) or mobile equipment identifier (“MEID“) for your mobile device, the address of a referring web site (if any), and the pages you visit on our Sites and Mobile Apps, and the times of visit. We may use this information for any and all lawful purposes, including to operate, maintain, and manage our Services and to provide other services such as technical support. We provide additional information regarding our use of “cookies“ in this Privacy Policy below. 

McDonald’s Philippines may use various new and hereafter developed technologies to collect Usage Information and demographic information about you (“Tracking Technologies“) which technologies may be downloaded to your device and may set or modify settings on your device. A few of the methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed): 

  * _Embedded Scripts._ An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with Mobile Apps, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Mobile App, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 
  * _ETag (or entity tag)._ A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of device identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies. 



Mobile Apps may collect precise information about the location of your mobile device using technologies such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. McDonald’s Philippines uses this information for locationbased services that you request such as locating nearby McDonald’s restaurants or identifying special offers that may be of interest to you or to deliver relevant content to you based on your location or to allow you to share your location to other users as part of the Services under our Mobile Apps. For most mobile devices, you are able to withdraw your permission for McDonald’s Philippines to acquire this information on your location through the device settings. 

If you have any questions about how to prevent us from collecting exact information about your location, we recommend you contact your mobile-device service provider, the device manufacturer, or your web-browser provider. Some online Services may not work properly without information about your location. If you would like us to delete information we have collected which could identify your location, please contact us through the Contact information provided below. By law, please note that we may need to keep certain information. 

###  **Information from Other Sources.**

We may collect public profile information when customers interact with us through social media to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the specific business purposes, functions, or activities. 

###  **The protection and security measures that we have designed.**

To ensure the security of the Personal Data you submit, McDonald’s Philippines always uses industrystandard encryption software and technologies when transferring and receiving customer data. We have appropriate security measures that protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Data that you have submitted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand that there may be circumstances beyond McDonald’s Philippines’ reasonable control that may result in the instability or insufficiency of said measures. You agree that, under such circumstances, McDonald’s Philippines shall not be liable or responsible for any unauthorized use, sharing, transfer, alteration, loss, or damage to any information that McDonald’s Philippines may have gathered. 

###  **How long we retain various data.**

McDonald’s Philippines only retains Personal Data for as long as the retention is required for the purposes for which we collected the Personal Data, the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and for our business and legal purposes. Generally, we do not retain Personal Data for a period of longer than five (5) years after the original purposes for which the Personal Data was collected have ceased to be applicable, unless otherwise required by law or other mandatory directions by court or government authorities or for purposes of legal proceedings or other similar proceedings or investigations.

##  **3\. Children’s Privacy Notice**

We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit our Sites and Mobile Apps or use our Services. This Children’s Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to Personal Data we collect through our Services from children under the age of eighteen (18) (subject always to applicable law). 

###  **What Personal Information Does McDonald’s Collect?**

Generally, Personal Data will not be collected from any person who is known by McDonald’s Philippines to be under the age of 18 (the “ **Child** “) without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. 

In the event that the Child is allowed to access information through the online Services, rest assured that we collect only limited Personal Data from the Child e.g. email addresses, postal address, contact number upon the consent provided by a parent or guardian in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

We may offer many features on our Sites, like games and colouring books, which do not require a Child to provide any Personal Data. 

We will not collect more detailed information from a Child, without the consent of a parent or guardian. If parent or guardian consent is required we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent. McDonald’s Philippines will not condition a Child's participation in any child-appropriate online activity on the Child's disclosure of more Personal Data than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

###  **How Does McDonald’s Use the Personal Data It Collects?**

We use email addresses submitted by a Child in order to respond to the Child’s request or to notify the Child if he or she has won or lost a contest or promotion they entered or participated in. We use the email address of a parent or guardian, in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent. 

Personal Data collected from the Child is used solely by McDonald’s Philippines, the McDonald's Family, and its service providers. 

###  **How Does McDonald’s Share Personal Information?**

We may share the Child's Personal Data with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our Services, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities; or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. 

We may also share Personal Data collected from the Child with vendors that perform services for McDonald's Philippines and the McDonald’s Family. These services may include hosting our online Services, providing technical, marketing, advertising fulfilment or other services to GADC or the McDonald's system. Such vendors are obligated to protect the confidentiality of the Personal Data that we share with them. 

###  **Requests from Parents / Guardians Regarding Our Children’s Privacy Practices**

Parents / Guardians may review the Personal Data we have collected from their Child that has not been deleted, and can request that the Personal Data be deleted from our records if it has not been already. Parents / Guardians also may refuse to permit further collection or use of their Child’s Personal Data, when the parent / guardian has previously provided consent. To do so, please contact us through the Contact information provided below. 

###  **Who Should I Contact with Questions?**

We urge parents / guardians to regularly monitor and supervise their Child’s on-line activities. If you have any questions about our Children’s Privacy Notice, please contact us through the Contact information provided below. 

##  **4\. Access**
