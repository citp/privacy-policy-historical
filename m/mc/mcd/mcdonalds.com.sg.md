McDonald’s may share personal information within the McDonald’s Family.  The McDonald’s Family includes McDonald’s Corporation, its affiliates, subsidiaries, suppliers, vendors, and franchisees.  Members of the McDonald’s Family that receive this information from McDonald’s are not authorized to use or disclose the information except as provided in this Privacy policy.

McDonald’s  may share personal information with vendors that provide services to McDonald’s, such as fulfilling orders, providing data processing and other information technology services, administering promotions, contests, prize draws and sweepstakes, conducting research and performing analytics, and personalizing individual McDonald’s experiences. We do not authorize these vendors to use the personal information or to disclose it for any purpose other than to perform services on our behalf.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, McDonald’s decides to sell or transfer all or a portion of our business.  We may transfer information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

McDonald’s reserves the right to use or disclose personal information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of our Online Services and in-restaurant technologies, to bring or defend against legal claims, to protect the rights, interests, safety and security of McDonald’s, McDonald’s employees or franchisees, or members of the public, or in connection with the investigation of fraud, illegal activity or violation of McDonald’s policy.

  4. **Children’s Privacy Notice**



McDonald’s understands the importance of privacy of users of our Online Services.  We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our Online Services.  This Children’s Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to personal information we collect through our Online Services from children under the age of 14.

  1. _What Personal Information Does McDonald’s Collect?_



We offer many features on our Sites, like games and coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal information.  On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address from children as part of an activity.  For example:

  * We may collect a child’s email address to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstakes.  In that event, we will notify the child using the email address the child supplies.  We will not keep the email address or use it for any other purpose.


  * We may collect a child’s email address in order to respond to a request from the child on a one-time basis, such as to send the child a screen saver.  In this case we promptly delete the email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the address for any other purpose.



We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 14 (subject always to applicable law), such as a postal address or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian.  If parent or guardian consent is required, we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.

McDonald’s will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.

  1. _How Does McDonald’s Use the Personal Information It Collects?_



We use email addresses submitted by a child in order to respond to the child’s request or to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstakes they entered.  We use the email address of a parent or guardian in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent.

  1. _How Does McDonald’s Share Personal Information?_



We may share a child’s personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our Online Services, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities, or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for McDonald’s. These services may include hosting our Sites, providing technical services to McDonald’s, fulfilling requests or administering a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstakes.  We do not authorize such vendors to disclose the personal information we share with them other than as necessary to perform the relevant service for McDonald’s.

  1. _Requests from Parents Regarding Our Children’s Privacy Practices._



Parents may review personal information we have collected from their child that has not been deleted, and can request that the personal information be deleted from our records if it has not been already.  Parents also may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s personal information, when the parent has previously provided consent.  To do so, please contact us at the address, or email address provided below with your request.

  1. _Who Should I Contact with Questions about Children’s Privacy?_

  7. **Cookies and Similar Technologies**



McDonald’s uses cookies and other similar technologies to collect information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy under “How We Use the Information We Collect.”  
_Cookies_  
A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.   Like most websites, McDonald’s uses cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience.  For example, we track the total number of visitors to our Sites on an anonymous aggregate basis.  We may also employ cookies so that we remember you when you return to the Site, to keep track of the items in your shopping cart if you purchase merchandise online, to administer certain contests and sweepstakes and to help customize your McDonald’s web experience.   We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.   Both we and others (such as out advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities, overtime and across third-party websites, when using our Online services.

Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Click on the “Help” section of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.  If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this Site.  
_Other Technologies_

We may use other technologies, including web beacons and JavaScript, which sometimes work together with cookies and other means with our Sites and Mobile Apps to uniquely identify your device.  These other technologies help enable features on our Sites and within our Mobile Apps.  
We may also use certain technologies to determine whether you have opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail.  
Please note the following:

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies and other similar technologies.
  * We use both session and persistent cookies and other tracking technologies.  Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or session-based (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).  You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of Online Services.
  * We may encode and protect the tracking cookies and other tracking technologies that McDonald’s sets, so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.
  * Where video is available on our Online Services, we may target and track the videos you view.  You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through Online Services or third-party social media for up to two years, or as permitted by applicable law, or until consent is withdrawn.


  8. **Targeted** **Advertising**



On our Online Services, we may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising tailored to your individual interests.  This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks.  Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other technologies.  The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.  This data collection takes place both on our Online Services and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.  This process also helps us evaluate our marketing efforts.  
Please note that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your specific interests.

  9. **Links to Other Websites and Social Media**



Our Online Services may offer links to third-party websites that are not operated by McDonald’s.  If you visit one of these linked websites, you should review the website’s Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, and other policies.  We are not responsible for the policies and practices of third-parties.  Any information you submit to those third-parties is subject to their privacy policy, terms and conditions, and other policies.

  10. **Information Security**



McDonald’s is committed to taking appropriate measures designed to keep personal information secure.  We have in place technical, administrative, and physical procedures designed to protect personal information from accidental, unlawful or unauthorized loss, access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction.  While we take efforts to safeguard our information systems, no website, mobile application, computer system, or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

  11. **Retention of Personal Information**



We retain personal information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and as is required or permitted by Singapore law.
