**information we collect and how it's used**

McDonald's only gathers personal information, such as, first and last names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by you. When a product is purchased through this website or through marketing / promotional activities (e.g.: via this website, in a store, over the telephone etc.), personal information may be requested (such as name, phone, email and address) in order to provide product information, marketing materials, provide newsletters, electronic newsletters (e-newsletters), provide new release / launch information, and advise of other McDonald’s products, competitions or events, which may be of interest. No one is obligated to provide personal information. However, failure to do so may result in McDonald’s being unable to provide you with upcoming promotion, event or product information and/or provide certain services including sales of products and after sales services. 

In common with many commercial websites we may also collect information which tells us about visitors to our website. For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of the website are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not linked to the identity of visitors, except where the website is accessed via links in an email we have sent.

**passive information collection**

As you navigate through this website, certain anonymous information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this website some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This website may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this website might not work without cookies and this may limit the services provided by our website. 

This website may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information to provide better service to website visitors, customize the website based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the website for your use. Such information is not combined with personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the website unless you have consented. 

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to a computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. McDonald’s may use cookies to make use of the website and services as convenient as possible. Cookies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. Cookies allow McDonald’s to monitor the items an individual may want to access as they move through the website, and records how many people are using the different parts of the website. 

"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the website "remembers" previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on the website. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer. 

"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as passwords), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the Web website based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this website on your computer may hold personally identifiable information, but only if you have registered or have otherwise consented to the retention of personally identifiable information you have provided at the website. Otherwise, our website's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to the website. 

You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser. 

A website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a website, and administer and improve the website. 

"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the website and on different pages of the website. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted. 

"Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the website, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.

**sharing of personal information**

McDonald's may share personal information within the McDonald's Family. The McDonald's Family includes McDonald's Australia Limited, our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our related bodies corporate. Of course, any use of this information by the McDonald's Family will comply with this privacy policy. Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you, such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, etc. If you do not elect to receive such materials, we will not send them to you. 

Companies may be engaged by McDonald's to perform a variety of functions, such as, fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for our web sites, etc. These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions. However, these companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose.

McDonald's does not sell personal information to third parties. However, with your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from McDonald's business partners. If you elect to receive such materials, McDonald's will not share your personal information with such partners but rather will send a mailing or e-mail on behalf of the partners. 

McDonald's reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the website, to fulfil your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.

**children**

McDonald's is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are proud of our long-time commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any communications with one of our most treasured customers - children. 

On our web sites, we offer many features, like games and colouring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. We collect only limited personal information from children 12 and under (like their email addresses) to respond to their online requests. For example, we may collect a child's email address in order to send the child a screen saver, but we promptly delete the email address from our system. Or, we may collect a child's email address in order to enter the child in a competition. We may also ask a child to provide an email address of a parent so we can notify the parent or seek consent. We may collect a postal address or a telephone number from a child when they enter a competition at our restaurants or when they join a birthday club. Whenever an in-store competition or a birthday club is aimed at children 12 and under, we will ask the child to seek the consent of a parent or guardian. McDonald's will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

Personal information collected from children is used solely by McDonald's or other entities that provide technical, fulfilment or other services to McDonald's. For example, such entities may provide services, such as, improving our web sites, fulfilling requests or administering competitions. This personal information is not sold or transferred to third parties. 

We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities.

**security of personal information**

McDonald’s will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any personal information recorded, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. The information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Access is restricted to those involved in administration or fulfilment of the competition entered or of any request for which you have provided your personal information. 

In some cases these facilities may be overseas. McDonald’s employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by McDonald’s. However, security of communications over the Internet cannot be guaranteed, and therefore absolute assurance that information will be secure at all times cannot be given. McDonald’s will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to personal information.

**access**

You are in control of any personal information you provide to us. If at any time, you would like to correct the personal information we have about you or if you would like to change your preferences for contacts from us or on behalf of our business partners, you can let us know by contacting us at the email or postal address listed below. Your personal information may be stored in different locations depending upon the reason for which you originally submitted the information. The more information you can provide us about when you originally submitted your personal information, the quicker McDonald's will be able to retrieve your personal information. 

In order to review any personal information we have about you or to ask us to delete that information or to stop further use of the information, please submit this information request form. Please allow 14 days for this request to be processed.

**links to other sites**

We may offer links to sites that are not operated by McDonald's. If you visit one of these linked sites, you should review their privacy and other policies. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of other companies.

**other McDonald's sites**

All McDonald's web sites operated by McDonald's Australia Limited will adhere to this privacy policy. The policies of some McDonald's sites may vary, however, because of local customs, practices or laws or due to circumstances unique to that website. In all cases, however, sites operated by McDonald's will honour the commitments to our customers set forth in this policy regarding the collection and use of personal information.

**franchisee websites**

Many McDonald's restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees, who are independent businessmen and women. Some franchisees also operate web sites. We encourage franchisees follow this privacy policy. However, please review the privacy policy of each web site to determine the privacy policies of that web site.

**changes to our privacy policy**

From time to time, it may be necessary for McDonald's to change this privacy policy, so we suggest that you check here periodically. Rest assured, however, that any changes will not be retroactively applied and will not alter how we handle previously collected information.
