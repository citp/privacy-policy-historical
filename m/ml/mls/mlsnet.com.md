We make every effort to ensure that you and your children can freely take advantage of all of MLSnet.com's features and content, knowing that any personal information you provide to us will be protected. Please review the outline below, detailing our information gathering policies and addressing some of the most common concerns.

**1\. Policies for Children Under 13 Years Old**

As described below, MLSnet.com will not knowingly collect or maintain any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years old without the express consent of their parent or guardian.

A number of interactive features on MLSnet.com require registration to participate. All registrants for these features will be required to enter their full name, age, zip code and e-mail address to be used as an identifier for the feature. 

When a person indicating an age of less than 13 years tries to register for such features on MLSnet.com, we will not retain any of his or her personally identifiable information submitted by the child. If we become aware that we have inadvertently retained personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. We may request the disclosure of information that is reasonably necessary to participate in the feature for which the child is attempting to register (such as a favorite team or player), but which does not identify the child personally. Because MLSnet.com does not knowingly retain any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties. 

Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to participate in some interactive features of MLSnet.com that do not require registration but do necessitate the collection and retention of personally identifiable information (e.g., entering some sweepstakes or contests). 

MLSnet.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate together in the interactive activities offered on MLSnet.com. 

**2\. Policies for Individuals 13 Years Old and Older**

To participate in some of the interactive features on MLSnet.com, you may be required to submit some personal information that allows MLSnet.com to fulfill your order or process your request. In addition, MLSnet.com may share information submitted by you with MLS league business partners and sponsors. MLSnet.com will not share any personal information submitted by you without posting a notification that MLSnet.com intends to do so, and giving you an opportunity to elect not to have it shared. 

_Registration._ You will be required to register to take advantage of some of the interactive activities on MLSnet.com. To register, you will need to submit your full name, age, zip code and e-mail address as an identifier for the feature. You may also be asked to provide optional information, such as your favorite MLS team and activity, mailing address, and demographic information. These fields are optional, and will not interfere with your registration should you choose to leave them blank. 

Optional fields are used internally to help MLSnet.com better tailor our services to suit our users' needs. No optional demographic information is ever shared with any outside entity, except in an aggregated format.

For information about registration for children, please consult Section 1 in this Privacy Policy. 

_Other Services._ MLSnet.com may offer you an opportunity to participate in various contests, surveys or other promotional features, or you may sign up to receive other information from the MLS or its member teams (e.g., "90 Minutes", the official online newsletter of the MLS, notification about events in your area or merchandise specials). The information you will be required to submit will vary, but will typically include your full name, age, and e-mail address. You may also be requested to answer certain optional survey questions, such as your favorite MLS team or activity. Information received through such activities will be used by MLSnet.com or MLS teams to send you the requested information or to administer contests and notify prize winners. Such information may be shared with MLS business partners, unless you opt out of receiving future mailings at the time you sign up, or later, by following the procedures in Section 4 below. Unless expressly noted otherwise, children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be allowed to sign up for such activities. 

**3\. Participating in Forums, Chats, and Q &As **

To participate in an online chat or send e-mail to MLSnet.com, we request a first name, city, state, province or country, and e-mail address which will only be used to acknowledge receipt of the message or to respond to the sender's request when MLSnet.com determines that a response is warranted. 

Please note that information or statements that are volunteered while participating in a MLSnet.com chat, fan forum, or Q&A session will not be treated as confidential and may be posted on MLSnet.com. You will not be able to change or remove any public postings made once posted. All submissions will become the property of MLSnet.com. Please review the Terms of Use for more information about making submissions to MLSnet.com. 

MLSnet.com does not maintain a record of any of the information collected through such activities in retrievable form, nor does MLSnet.com share the information with MLS business partners or sponsors for promotional purposes, except in aggregate form. 

**4\. Opting Out**

MLSnet.com provides you the opportunity to opt out of receiving various communications, advertisements and promotions offered either by MLSnet.com or by our partners. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us after you register. You can also easily edit your account to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your User ID and password in order to access your account.

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you will be unable to use those MLSnet.com services that require registration in order to participate. If you choose not to accept cookies, or cancel your cookies after registration, you will not have the ability to log-on on to MLSnet.com, make transactions (i.e., order and pay for products through MLSnet.com) or access your account. In limited circumstances, we may retain information that you have requested be removed but which cannot be completely deleted from our databases due to technical constraints and the backup of our computer system. See Section 7 below for more information on cookies. 

**5\. Security Policies**

Please keep in mind that whatever you publicly disclose online - for example, in a chat or through e-mail - can be collected and used by others, and any Internet transmission you make may be unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. While we take reasonable measures to protect your personal information, MLSnet.com cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. In addition, MLSnet.com may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we determine such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court order or operation of law. 

**6\. Use of Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's computer hard drive for informational and record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at MLSnet.com. Accepting a cookie does not give anyone access to your computer or to any personal information. It is simply a small file in which we keep information that identifies you as a unique user. For example, we may use a cookie to indicate when you have already voted in an online poll to prevent multiple voting and a distortion of results. 

The use of cookies is an industry standard; you will find cookies used at most major websites. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Although you will still be able to enjoy many of the features on MLSnet.com if you disable your browser from accepting cookies, some parts of MLSnet.com will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests or playing games. 

**7\. About IP Addresses and Surveys Used for Research Purposes**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web; it performs a function for individual computers much like a Post Office Box number serves Postal Service customers. Web servers - the computers that "serve up" Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When users request pages on MLSnet.com, our servers log their IP addresses. 

This logging allows MLS to better understand the traffic that comes to MLSnet.com, and to tailor content and services to better suit your needs. In many cases, users visiting MLSnet.com from work or from other services that utilize a "firewall" - a computer used to control the flow of Internet traffic to and from another computer network - may share a single IP address with other users behind the same firewall.

Please review each activity prior to use and only participate in those that involve the disclosure of information you are comfortable with sharing. MLSnet.com will occasionally ask users to complete surveys or questionnaires which we use for general research purposes to improve MLSnet.com and serve you better. These surveys are always optional and you do not have to answer any survey question to visit MLSnet.com.

MLSnet.com analyzes research statistics compiled from surveys and IP addresses on an aggregated, anonymous basis, for system administration and usage patterns, and may share that analysis with advertisers, MLS business partners and sponsors. In rare circumstances, however, we will use such information to identify a user when necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect MLSnet.com, its users or others. 

**8\. Links from MLSnet.com to Other Websites**

The MLSnet.com Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on MLSnet.com. When you link to the website of a third party, either through an advertising banner on MLSnet.com or through clicking through a link to an outside website, your use of those websites will be subject to the privacy policies of these third parties, which may differ from MLSnet.com's Privacy Policy.
