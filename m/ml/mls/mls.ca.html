        POLICY</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is the policy of The
        Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal
        information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address
        or telephone number is private and confidential. Because
        your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains an
        Internet privacy policy to protect your personal
        information on its mls.ca website.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>1. </b><b><u>Sites
        Covered By This Policy</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">MLS.ca is made up of and
        includes links to many sites including board home pages,
        REALTOR home pages, advertisers and, in some cases, board
        listing information sites. This privacy policy applies
        only to those sites which display the <strong>CREA
        Privacy Policy</strong> statement. While CREA encourages
        the site operators to comply with these principles, users
        should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites
        appearing on or linking to or from mls.ca which do not
        display the statement. Personal information that you
        choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the
        privacy policies of those sites.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>2. </b><b><u>The
        Information We Collect</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(a) Site Activity Data</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each time a visitor comes
        to the mls.ca site, our Web server collects only the
        visitor’s domain name /IP address but not the e-mail
        address. While CREA itself does not use
        "cookies", such use is common in the Internet
        industry and cookies are used by CREA’s advertising
        agency. A cookie is a small piece of information that a
        Web site sends to a visitor’s computer, which is
        stored on his or her hard drive. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the use of cookies,
        CREA’s advertising agency tracks repeat visits by
        the same visitor and measures basic usage data such as
        the number of visits, the average time spent on the site,
        pages reviewed, etc. This information may be consolidated
        into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated
        basis with potential advertisers, research firms and
        member boards and associations. The shared data will not
        disclose your identity or personal data and will not
        enable the recipients to contact you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>(b) Personal
        Information</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Personal information, such
        as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone
        number is collected only when you voluntarily provide it.
        Such information is received by CREA only when you send
        an e-mail through the site or make some other specific
        contact such as a response to an on-line survey.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The personal information
        you provide to CREA is forwarded only to the person or
        department that is equipped to handle your request and is
        used only to respond to your inquiry. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>3. </b><b><u>Restriction
        On Use Of Information</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The data collected is used
        to help CREA analyze the browsing patterns of its
        visitors in order to improve the content and design of
        mls.ca. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Personal information will
        not be sold to any third parties, nor will such
        information be added to bulk e-mailing lists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>4. </b><b><u>Policy
        Revisions</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Any changes to the CREA
        Privacy Policy will be promptly communicated on this
        page. Policy changes will not alter how we handle
        previously submitted personal information.</font></p>
