# Welcome to MLS PIN - Connecting Real Estate Professionals

MLS Property Information Network, Inc. (“MLS PIN”) respects and seeks to protect the privacy of all visitors to this web site. The following Internet Privacy Policy (“this Policy”) explains how MLS PIN treats data collected and received both from its customers (that is, its Participants and Subscribers) and from other visitors to this web site. 

TYPES OF INFORMATION MLS PIN COLLECTS  
MLS PIN collects personal data from a customer when the customer registers for MLS PIN services. Those data include, but are not limited to, the customer’s name, address, email address and telephone number. In addition, MLS PIN collects the personal data of potential purchasers of properties listed on the multiple listing service and of other indirect recipients of MLS PIN services when a customer voluntarily submits those data to it. Those data include, but are not limited to, the name, address, email address and telephone number of such prospects and other indirect recipients of MLS PIN services. 

When a customer files a listing in the MLS PIN multiple listing service, MLS PIN collects property listing data. Those data include, but are not limited to, images of the listed property. 

MLS PIN does not collect personal or other data of any kind from casual visitors to the MLS PIN web site, except such data as a visitor may elect to provide through the web site when reporting either a listing that is erroneously omitted from the multiple listing service or an existing listing that the visitor believes violates MLS PIN’s Rules and Regulations. 

SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA AND PROPERTY LISTING DATA  
MLS PIN does NOT share a customer’s personal data with other customers and does NOT share a customer’s personal data with, or transfer it to, any other third persons or entities, except that (a) MLS PIN may include a customer’s email address in any form, format or medium in which MLS PIN from time to time collects and/or disseminates to its customers the property listing data, information, images and/or tax information that constitute the MLS PIN listing database and (b) MLS PIN may share its customers’ names, contact telephone numbers and email addresses with, or transfer them to, a third party that provides an MLS PIN approved product or service to MLS PIN’s customers. MLS PIN will provide customers’ email addresses to such a third party only if the product or service, as approved, cannot function without those email addresses and only if the email addresses are used by the third party solely to assure that function. 

MLS PIN does NOT share with, or transfer to, any third persons or entities the personal data of potential purchasers of properties listed in the multiple listing service or of other indirect recipients of MLS PIN services, nor does it share or transfer the personal data of a casual visitor voluntarily filing a complaint or reporting a listing violation. MLS PIN may make available to the media and other interested parties statistical aggregations or analyses of the property listing data in the MLS PIN database. These aggregations and analyses will not disclose the details of individual property listings or transactions, will not contain the characteristics of individual listed properties and will not include the personal data of the owners, prospective purchasers or any agents involved in the listing or sale of a listed property. 

MLS PIN reserves the right to use or disclose any data or information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.

PROPERTY LISTING DATA  
When a customer submits property listing data to MLS PIN, including but not limited to images, those data and images become part of the compilation that is the MLS PIN listing database. All right, title, and interest in and to each and every manifestation of that compilation, and in and to MLS PIN’s copyrights therein, remain at all times vested in MLS PIN. By submitting a property listing to MLS PIN, a customer, through its Participant, represents and warrants that the Participant, without the necessity of any further consent or approval, has been authorized to grant, and does grant, authority to MLS PIN to include both the property listing data and all related images in the MLS PIN database compilation and in any manifestation of that compilation and to use the listing data and images for such other purposes as MLS PIN from time to time shall determine. Ownership of MLS PIN’s database compilation and the limits on its customers’ permitted use of the database compilation are governed by the MLS PIN Rules and Regulations.
