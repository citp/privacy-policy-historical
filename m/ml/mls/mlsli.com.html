<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<h3>MLSLI.COM TAKES 
  YOUR PRIVACY SERIOUSLY.</h3> Please read the following to learn more about our 
  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; This privacy policy may be updated from time to time so 
  please check back frequently.&nbsp;
<p>Click 
  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_child">here</a> 
  for information on Internet safety and security from the Federal Trade Commission.
</p><p>MLSLI.com is committed 
  to your privacy and security and want to provide you with the best possible 
  online experience. To that end, we want you to understand what kinds of information 
  we gather from you, how this information is used and safeguarded, and how you 
  can control its use.
</p><h3>This privacy policy covers the following issues:</h3>
<p><strong>What information is collected from me? </strong>
</p><p>The kinds of information we collect from you will vary, depending on how you 
  use our website. It’s possible to browse our site without submitting any personally 
  identifiable information (“personal information”) at all, but if you choose 
  to take advantage of some of our products and services, you may be asked to 
  provide information such as a user name and password, your real name, e-mail 
  address, phone number, address, your license or MLS ID# or, for certain e-commerce 
  transactions, your credit card information.&nbsp; Whenever we ask for this kind of 
  information, we strive to provide a link to this Privacy Policy to help you 
  understand how your personal information will be used before you decide whether 
  to disclose it.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the personal information you choose to submit, our systems are 
  set up to gather certain anonymous data to help us to better understand how 
  the site is being used and how we can improve it.&nbsp; This automatically gathered 
  data includes your computer’s “Internet Protocol” (“IP”) address, statistics 
  about how visitors navigate through our site and information provided through 
  the use of cookies (which is described in more detail below).&nbsp; 
</p><p>Finally, as you visit 
    our site, be aware that third parties may at times be able to gather information 
    from you.&nbsp; For example, third party ad servers and companies that place advertisements 
    on our site may use their own cookies&nbsp; and companies offering products or 
    services through the MLSLI.com site may use their own cookies and may collect 
    and use the information you submit. In these cases, the third parties would 
    use your information according to their own privacy policies which may differ 
    from this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  

</p><p><strong>How is my information used? </strong>
</p><p>The use of 
  your information depends on the context in which it is collected.&nbsp; Therefore, 
  pay special attention to the categories below that relate to the features of 
  our site that you wish to utilize.&nbsp; Also be aware that MLSLI.com may at times 
  be legally compelled to disclose certain information, by means such as subpoenas 
  or court orders.&nbsp; 
</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong> 
</p><p>These are small 
  files that we send to and store on your computer so that we can recognize it 
  as a unique machine the next time you visit our site.&nbsp; Our cookies are used 
  for three reasons: (1) to keep track of your information for your own convenience; 
  (2) to help us optimize your online experience by altering our content depending 
  on your particular needs or browsing patterns, and to provide you with advertisements, 
  products and services of interest to you; and (3) to help us understand the 
  size of our audience and their traffic patterns within our network.&nbsp; Some of 
  our advertisers and third-party ad servers may also utilize their own cookies. 
  Also, companies offering products or services through the MLSLI.com website 
  may use their own cookies. 
</p><p><strong>Registration </strong>
</p><p>The information you provide when you become a registered user to certain pages 
  of our site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience.&nbsp; 
  Your e-mail address serves as a unique identifier in our record system, and 
  it is used together with your password to prevent unauthorized access to any 
  information you choose to store on our sites.&nbsp; The date you give us about your 
  personal preferences and demographics (such as age, zip code, occupation, or 
  other date) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products and 
  services that are most likely to appeal to you.&nbsp; In addition, we may share this 
  information, in aggregate form with our current and potential advertisers so 
  they can know how to present their ads more effectively.&nbsp; Please note that we 
  do not accept or store registration for anyone under the age of 13 under any 
  circumstances.&nbsp; <br>
</p><blockquote> * Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we 
    may also use the e-mail address you provide at registration to contact you 
    for promotional, administrative, or other reason.&nbsp; You may have these communications 
    terminated at any time.&nbsp; If you indicate that you’re interest in hearing from 
    other companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose.&nbsp;  
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tools </strong>
</p><p>Our sites allow 
  you to use may helpful tools, such as financial and home improvements calculators, 
  real estate search tools, and others, without disclosing any personal information.&nbsp; 
  These tools are for your benefit and the information you submit when you use 
  them (typically impersonal data) is not disclosed to anyone or used for any 
  purpose other than to provide you with the service you’re seeking.&nbsp; <br>

</p><p><strong>User Registration Services </strong>
</p><p>You may choose to 
    request products or services of a more substantial or personal nature when 
    using our website.&nbsp; For example, you may apply for a loan, request our help 
    in locating a remodeling contractor, store your preferences for convenience 
    in using our sites, or make an online purchase.&nbsp; The information you provide 
    when seeking these services may be used in the following ways:&nbsp; <br> 
</p><blockquote> 
    <p> 
      * For services provide by the MLSLI.com website, the information you submit 
      is used by us to provide the service you’ve requested.&nbsp; We may also share 
      this information with subcontractors, but only to the extent necessary to 
      fulfill your request.&nbsp; In addition, we may use the contact information and 
      nonfinancial order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address, 
      as set out in the Registration section above.&nbsp; If the service you request 
      requires submission of financial information such as credit card number 
      for an online purchase, rest assured that this financial information is 
      used only for processing your payment, and is not retained after completion 
      of your order.&nbsp; We may, however, store your nonfinancial order information 
      for accounting purposes and to help us to understand your preferences better 
      so that we can offer you future products or services that you may find useful.&nbsp; 
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Purchasing Products And Managing Your Services</strong> 
</p><p>For products and services offered to you jointly by MLSLI.com and a third party, 
  your information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. 
  In these situations, MLSLI.com will only use your personal information as it 
  would as if offer the product or service by itself, but the third party may 
  use the information in different ways. You can tell when a product or service 
  is offered by a third party, because a page of our site will be “co-branded” 
  displaying the third party’s logo and/or name along with our own, or you will 
  be linked to the third party’s site to complete the transaction. Please be aware 
  that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding the use 
  and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this 
  Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information might 
  be used or protected by a third party, we encourage you to become familiar with 
  that company’s privacy policy before using the service or requesting the product, 
  or to not request the particular product or service.&nbsp; From time to time, we 
  may wish to use personal information you provide when requesting a product or 
  service for purposes beyond those listed above.&nbsp; If this is the case, you will 
  always be notified of the additional use prior to your submitting the personal 
  information, and you’ll be given a chance to “opt out” of that use or to not 
  complete the request, or to not&nbsp; respond to or participate in the survey, contest 
  or other request.&nbsp; 
</p><p><strong>Solicited Information </strong>
</p><p>You may occasionally 
  see contests, surveys and other features of our site that ask you to provide 
  us with personal information. When you choose to respond to these requests, 
  the personal information you offer may be used for several purposes. These include 
  the uses set out in the registration section above. They also include providing 
  information to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects 
  of any contest or similar offerings.&nbsp; If we are going to use your personal information 
  for any other purpose, we will notify you of that purpose and give you a chance 
  to opt-out before responding to our survey, contest form or other request, or 
  not to respond to or participate in the survey, contest or other request.&nbsp; 
</p><p><strong>User Initiated Communication </strong>
</p><p>Our website enables 
  you to send e-mail to us or to third parties and to participate in public bulletin 
  boards and discussion groups. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of 
  communication with us, or anyone else, you may expect to be contacted in return. 

</p><p><strong>Automatically Gathered Data </strong>
</p><p>The information 
  gathered automatically by our system—such as your computer’s IP address, the 
  kind of browser you’re using, and a record of your navigation through our site—may 
  be used by MLSLI.com so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and 
  useful to our audience.&nbsp; In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate 
  form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present 
  their advertisements more effectively. 
</p><p><strong>What choices do I have regarding the use of my information? </strong>
</p><p>Reading this Privacy 
  Policy should help you understand how any information you share with us might 
  be used. If you feel concerned about any of these uses, you might elect not 
  to participate in certain services, features or products that we offer. We will 
  never collect personal information about you without your knowledge, so the 
  decision whether or not to share this information is completely up to you. 
</p><p><strong>How do I "opt out"? </strong>
</p><p>You also have the ability to terminate e-mail newsletter correspondence from
   us at any time. You will either be given the chance to opt-out of direct mailings
  
  when you disclose your e-mail address to us, .you can simply reply to our e-mail
   typing “Unsubscribe” in the subject line or e-mail the appropriate webmaster
    below with your request , and we will promptly remove your address from that
   
  e-mail service: <script type="text/javascript">var a = new Array('info@m','lsli.co','m');document.write("<a href='mailto:"+a[0]+a[1]+a[2]+"'>info@mlsli.com</a>");</script><a href="mailto:info@mlsli.com">info@mlsli.com</a><br>
  <br>
  If you feel concerned about the cookies that are sent between our computers 
  and yours, you may, through your Web browser, either choose to reject them automatically, 
  or have your computer prompt you before accepting them. Generally, this is done 
  by selecting the appropriate cookies setting on your Web browser (usually found 
  in “Internet Options” or “Preferences”). Please note, however, that some of 
  our features and services depend on the use of cookies. Therefore, you will 
  be unable to take advantage of those features if you choose not to accept cookies. 
</p><p><strong>How is my information protected? </strong>
</p><p>Whenever personal information about you is stored on our computers, that information 
  is password-protected from unauthorized access or use. In addition, this information 
  is kept only on servers that are located behind a firewall which makes their 
  contents inaccessible to outside users. <br>
  <br>
  Since your financial information is especially sensitive, we take special care 
  to keep it secure. We will only transmit or ask for this information over secure 
  Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)encryption, the currently 
  accepted standard for online security, and security keys. In addition, we require 
  password authentication from any third parties you’ve authorized to receive 
  this information. Finally, your credit card number and financial information 
  are never stored on our servers.&nbsp; While this means you may have to enter this 
  information more than once, we believe the added security is worth the extra 
  effort. <br>
  <br>
  Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own
   and others’ privacy. We hope you’ll use common sense whenever you disclose
   personal  information over the Internet. Just as importantly, we encourage
   you to let 
  us know immediately if you suspect that the information you share with us is
    being used in any way contrary to this privacy policy.&nbsp; To contact us, please
     send an e-mail to: <script type="text/javascript">var a = new Array('info@m','lsli.co','m');document.write("<a href='mailto:"+a[0]+a[1]+a[2]+"'>info@mlsli.com</a>");</script><a href="mailto:info@mlsli.com">info@mlsli.com</a>.&nbsp; 
</p><p><strong>Scope of This Privacy Policy: Outside Links</strong> 
</p><p>This Privacy Policy 
  only applies to sites owned and operated by MLSLI.com.&nbsp; Our pages contain links 
  to sites outside our control. Please be aware that these sites may collect information 
  about you, and operate according to their own privacy practices that may differ 
  from this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Remember that once you’re outside our website, any 
  information you submit is outside of our control.<br>
