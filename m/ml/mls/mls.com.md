# Privacy Policy

MLS.com makes every effort to protect the privacy of all users. We collect no personal information from any Web visitor.

We do not send out any solicitations or any SPAM emails from MLS.com. If you receive an email appearing to be from MLS.com, it is likely fraudulent and was not generated by our company.

We do accumulate Web statistics that tell us how many people visited our site, what pages they accessed and what links they clicked on. These statistics may tell us what region or city a visitor is located in and when they visited MLS.com, but we do not capture names, addresses, ages or any other personal information.

We have third-party advertising companies serving ads on our Web site. You may choose to have one of our third party advertisers contact you by filling out their forms. These companies are independent of MLS.com. While we do not use 'cookies", they may use them or request personal information from you. They may share anonymous information about your visit with third parties. These third-party ads may place or recognize a "cookie" on your browser.
