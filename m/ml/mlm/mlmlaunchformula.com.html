            Welcome 
            to www.mlmlaunchformula.com (the "Site").<br>
            <br>
            We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, 
            especially when conducting business. <br>

            This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those 
            users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without <br>

            transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business 
            on the Site and make use of the various services offered by www.mlmlaunchformula.com 
            (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").<br>

            <br>

            <b>"Personally Identifiable Information"</b> <br>

            refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, 
            contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, 
            but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email 
            address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card 
            information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include 
            information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification 
            of the individual user) <br>

            or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.<br>

            <br>

            <b>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </b><br>

            We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. 
            We collect the following additional information from our Authorized 
            Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses 
            of Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and 
            the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized 
            Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>

            <br>

            <b>What organizations are collecting the information? </b><br>

            In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party 
            service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and 
            banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow 
            services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized 
            Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, 
            but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided 
            to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third 
            parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution 
            chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.<br>

            <br>

            <b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>

            We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, 
            to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling 
            requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers 
            about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or 
            information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also 
            use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized 
            Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested 
            information. <br>

            <br>

            <b>With whom may the information may be shared?</b><br>

            Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may 
            be shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential 
            transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated 
            information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our 
            Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and 
            third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of 
            receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting 
            on our behalf. <br>

            <br>

            and distribution of the information?</b><br>

            Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited 
            information from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated

            <br>

            <br>

            <b>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</b><br>

            Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain 
            information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services 
            they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect 
            our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is 
            logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will 
            automatically log the Authorized Customer off.<br>

            <br>

            <b>How does www.mlmlaunchformula.com use login information? </b><br>

            www.mlmlaunchformula.com uses login information, including, but not 
            limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, 
            administer the Site, track a user's movement and use, and gather broad 
            demographic information.<br>

            <br>

            <b>What partners or service providers have access to Personally Identifiable 
            Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on the Site?</b><br>

            www.mlmlaunchformula.com has entered into and will continue to enter 
            into partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors.<br>

            Such vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information 
            on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers for service 
            eligibility. <br>

            Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this 
            information. <br>

            Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law. 
            We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply 
            with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement 
            agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally Identifiable 
            Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our 
            Visitors and Authorized Customers. <br>

            <br>

            <b>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</b><br>

            All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices. 
            The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized 
            Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees 
            who are given a password in order to gain access to the information. 
            We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive 
            information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, 
            is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information 
            sent over the Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures 
            to maintain a secure site, electronic communications and databases 
            are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee 
            or warrant that such events will not take place and we will not be 
            liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences. 
            <br>

            <br>

            <b>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable 
            Information?</b><br>

            Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally 
            Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies 
            by emailing us at <b>support@onlinemlmsecrets.com</b>
            <br>

            <br>

            <b>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information 
            collected by the Site?</b><br>

            We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate 
            Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting 
            <b>support@onlinemlmsecrets.com</b>. 
            However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible 
            to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. 
            An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information 
            deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we 
            will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information 
            relating to that individual in any way moving forward. <br>

            <br>

            <b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br>

            We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes 
            to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, 
            if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause 
            disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or 
            Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we 
            will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor 
            or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure. <br>
