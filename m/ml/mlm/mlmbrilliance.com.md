# Privacy Policy

[](http://www.mlmbrilliance.com/about-tim-sales.cfm)  
Hi, I'm [Tim Sales](http://www.mlmbrilliance.com/about-tim-sales.cfm) and I personally guarantee that you will be happy with how my movies help grow your business.

Privacy is a primary concern today, on and off the Internet. We are aware of these concerns and want you to feel comfortable using our site.

MLM Brilliance believes that your personal information -- including your purchases, email and residential addresses, and credit card data -- belongs to you. We collect this type of information when you provide it to us, but we do not rent or sell information concerning our customers to third parties. We may partner with other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting, but we will never share your personal information with these organizations unless you give us permission to do so.

**How We Use The Information Collected**

During your visit to MLM Brilliance we collect the following information to be stored in our system:

  * Your e-mail address and password that provide access to special areas of our web site where you can streamline your shopping experience. 
  * Your shipping and billing address for orders. 
  * Your phone number so we can contact you concerning your order. 
  * Your e-mail address for order confirmation and updates for any new information from MLM Brilliance. You may opt out of our updates at any time. 



**What about cookies?**

MLM Brilliance uses a technology called "cookies" to remember you and the information you are saving, such as your shipping address. When you visit MLM Brilliance, we send you back a cookie, a small text file that includes a temporary inquiry number, your IP address, plus any items you've chosen. Your web browser has a special folder on your computer where it keeps cookies. Cookies cannot harm your computer in any way. Only the website that places a cookie on your computer can read it; no other website may access the cookie MLM Brilliance places on your computer.

**Security**

Ensuring secure online ordering is an important part of our pledge to honor your privacy. MLM Brilliance utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card information. SSL encrypts all ordering information, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. When you place an order with MLM Brilliance your credit card information is captured and stored separately from your order, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than our customer service staff.
