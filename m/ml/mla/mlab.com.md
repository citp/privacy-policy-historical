**Disclosing Information**  
We will NOT disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party except as required by law. In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties we may disclose aggregate user information. This information is based on information we may ask you to provide us at some time in the future. If you provide us with demographic data in the form of replies to user surveys, the information may be passed on in aggregate form to our partners and others. The aggregate data will never contain any personal identifying information or IP addresses or email addresses.

Our partner websites may provide a version of the the **M** lab.com service that is remotely hosted on our servers. If you created your the **M** lab.com message at one of our partner websites, they have access to all the data provided to them. Please be sure to check out their privacy policy as it may be different from ours.

We take precautions to protect your email data from loss, misuse or alteration and to safeguard and secure the data you provide online. While we strive to protect your data after it has arrived at our servers, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that is being transmitted over the Internet.

**A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY**  
Although the **M** lab.com is not specifically designed for children, we realize that they will use the service, and we encourage them to do so. We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and also consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can sometimes prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. We want children to enjoy the **M** lab.com as much as adults do, but responsible computing is first and foremost a family matter. We adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. Parents can help by spending time online with their children and monitoring their online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission. 

IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR PARENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. CHILDREN UNDER 13 SHOULD GET THEIR PARENT'S PERMISSION BEFORE GIVING OUT THEIR E-MAIL ADDRESS OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO the **M** lab.COM OR TO ANYONE ELSE ON THE INTERNET.
