The <strong>"Privacy Shield Principles"</strong> collectively means the 7 privacy principles and the 16 supplemental principles described in the Privacy Shield. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

            <article>
              <p>As set forth below, we collect personally identifiable information regarding our current, prospective and former clients, customers, visitors and guests via our Service and/or our Site. The types of personally identifiable information we may collect (directly from you or from third party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with us and the requirements of applicable law. As stated in our Guiding Principles above, we endeavor to collect information only relevant for the purposes of processing. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it.</p>
              <p><strong>User-provided information</strong> - mLab only collects personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. We only ask for information that's necessary for you (and your Authorized Users) to access, use and pay for our Service, including, but not limited to, the creation of your Account. This information may include, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and billing or payment information (such as credit card numbers). If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages and our responses so that we can provide you with better customer service. We also store information that you have indirectly provided to us via Your Content and Application(s), which may include, without limitation, your Users' personally identifiable information. </p>
              <p><strong>Log file information</strong> - Information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We use this information to identify potential security issues, to analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) trends, to administer the Site, to track averaged User movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our User base as a whole. We may also use this information to improve, customize and enhance our Service by expanding the Service's features and functionality and tailoring the Service to our Users' preferences. We do not use this information to identify individual Users.</p>

              <p>
                If you are an EU-based user, you may seek confirmation regarding whether we are processing personally identifiable information about you, request access to personally identifiable information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personally identifiable information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may contact us at the contact information under the "Contact Us" section below to request access to, receive (port), restrict processing, seek rectification or request erasure of personally identifiable information held about you by mLab. Such requests will be processed in accordance with local laws. Although mLab makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their personally identifiable information, there may be circumstances in which mLab is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others' privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question, or where it is commercially proprietary.  If mLab determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, mLab will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personally identifiable information.
              </p>

              <h4 class="privacy--section-title">Data Retention</h4>
              <p>We will retain your information for as long as your Account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service.

Session cookies are required for most of the functionality of our Site and for web tools such as our administrative application.

              <p>A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site that collects information about users' engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.</p>
              <p>If you reject cookies or web beacons, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some key areas of our Site, such as our administrative application tools, will be impaired.</p>

            <article>
              <p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us.</p>
              <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  For example, we encrypt the transmission of information using security socket layer technology (SSL) on all the pages where we interact with our users, including registration and login.</p>
              <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your own passwords and determining whether our Service meets your standards for security.</p>
