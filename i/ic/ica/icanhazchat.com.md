### What Information do we collect and for what purpose?

Our main goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Website and its services, and to administer the membership of registered users. 

We collect three types of information from the Website: 

personal information - Personal Information is any piece of information about an identifiable individual. In order to enjoy and use some of the features of the Website (such as broadcasting your own TV show, participating in contests etc.), you will have to register with the website and become a member. During the registration process you will be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information like your name, email address, postal address etc. that are required to operate these features and services. By voluntarily providing this Personal Information to us, by sending us a comment or suggestion, by becoming a member or by entering a contest that is posted on the website, you will be consenting to the collection, use and distribution of your personal information by us, for the purposes specified in the Privacy Policy. Please note that you are under no obligation to provide us with any Personal Information and can access and enjoy many parts of the Website without providing us with any personal information. 

We use your Personal Information for several purposes: (1) to enable you to use certain features, services and functionalities of the Website; (2) to contact you, respond to questions and comments you may send us, and to provide you with newsletters or other information about programming, special offers or services on the Website; (3) to operate and maintain the Website and its services, including moderating and running channels and chat-rooms; (4) to provide you with marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. In addition, we may combine your Personal Information and/or certain non-identifying information and aggregate it with information collected from other users of the Website, in order to better design the Website and services, by analyzing and evaluating the way the Website is being used. We may disclose such aggregated information as provided hereinafter. 

Anonymous Information about visits in the Website - When you visit the Website (whether as a member or as a visitor), information about your visit (such as how you navigate the site) may be collected and stored. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser and platform type, the length of your visit, the date and time of your visit, the pages you viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the websites you visit before and after leaving the Website. It does not include any personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address or telephone number. 

We use this information mainly to monitor and analyze the aggregate use of the Website and its services, and for the Website's technical administration. As mentioned above, we may aggregate such data (alone or with Personal Information) in order to better design the Website and services. 

Cookies - Like many other websites, we use "cookies" to collect information and to tailor the Website to the needs and interests of its members and visitors. A cookie is a small entry-in text file that is transferred from the Website's servers to your computer's hard drive, and uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies can only be read by the server that sent them to you, and cannot read data from your hard drive. The Website uses two types of Cookies for two purposes: (1) Persistent cookies that remain on your hard drive after you close your browser, and are used to save some information about you and your preferences (e.g. your registration ID) for future visits to the Website. (2) Session cookies that are temporary and are deleted from your hard drive after you close your browser. 

We use cookies to: (1) remember some information (e.g. registration ID) so that you will not have to re-enter it during each visit to the Website; (2) provide you with custom, personalized content and information; (3) monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; and (4) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.
