				<p>
				Nick.com and iCarly.com (hereinafter collectively known as “Nick.com”) is the place in cyberspace 
				where fans of Nickelodeon can come to find out more about their favorite Nick stars, play games, and 
				have their opinions heard. Nick.com believes in the power of kids and we urge both kids and their 
				parents to use and enjoy our website. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we 
				strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling 
				on the Web. Nick.com is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
				Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with 
				their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their 
				kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.</p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">What Information Is Collected?</font><br>
				At Nick.com, it's our policy to create website content that requires minimum collection of information 
				from our visitors. Generally, nick.com limits our collection of information from kids to what is known 
				as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. screen name, birthday, gender, state, zip code and country 
				of residence). This information is collected so kids can participate in activities (e.g. chat with celebrities, 
				post messages, play online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, 
				we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. kid's email address and/or email address of 
				parent or third party), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other 
				online activities (e.g. electronic postcards, newsletters). Nick.com does not condition a kid's participation 
				in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to 
				participate in the activity. As explained below, we also collect from parents additional types of 
				information (e.g., credit card and billing information) when they purchase products and offerings at our site.</p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Electronic Newsletter Subscription</font><br>
				Nick.com offers kids the opportunity to sign up to receive the Nick.com newsletter by email. 
				When a kid asks to receive our email newsletter, the child is asked to provide his or her first 
				name, email address and the email address of his or her parent. Within two business days of 
				receiving this information, we send the child's parent a notification email informing him or 
				her of the child's request to receive by email the Nick.com newsletter on an ongoing basis and 
				give the parent the option to have his or her child's information be removed from our Nick.com 
				newsletter database. At any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent has 
				the opportunity to exercise the option to request that we stop sending the child the Nick.com 
				newsletter and have the child's information removed from our Nick.com newsletter by following the 
				"unsubscribe" instructions found in either their initial notification email or at the end of any of 
				the Nick.com newsletter emails. In addition, parents may at any time review any identifiable 
				information collected about their child (see below, Parental Access). </p>
				<p>
				All information collected for Nick.com newsletters is used only to send the child the electronic 
				newsletter and may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by 
				us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic newsletter and perform 
				other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other 
				purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Contests and Sweepstakes</font><br>
				Nick.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. To participate 
				in a contest or sweepstakes, a child is asked to provide his or her first name and email address. 
				Sometimes, when we conduct contests or sweepstakes that may involve more than a one-time contact, 
				we ask additionally for the email address of his or her parent. In such types of contests or sweepstakes, 
				we send the child's parent an email within two business days informing him or her of the child's entry 
				and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information collected by nick.com 
				is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. 
				Once the contest or sweepstakes if finished, we then delete any personal information collected. 
				The information collected in a nick.com sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which 
				may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes and may not use it for other 
				purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. </p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Electronic Postcards and Email Messages</font><br>
				Nick.com provides kids the opportunity to send approved user generated videos and electronic 
				postcards featuring Nickelodeon characters or original artwork to family or friends. Also, 
				nick.com features information about products that kids are interested in and from time to time 
				will send, on behalf of kids who request it, email messages to family and/or friends to let family 
				and/or friends share their interest. We may ask for a first name, but we do not require kids to 
				submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send an electronic postcard 
				or for nick.com to send email messages to family or friends. We do, however, ask kids to submit the 
				email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. </p> 
				<p>
				Nick.com may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail to us. We may ask for first names, but 
				we request no personally identifiable information except an e-mail address, which we use solely 
				for the purpose of responding to messages and/or requests.</p> 
				<p>
				All information collected for electronic postcards and email messages is used only to send the requested 
				electronic postcard or email message and to respond to email questions and/or requests and is deleted 
				from our system once the electronic postcard, email message or email response is sent. </p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">“Nick Arcade”/Ordering from the Site and Opening An Account</font><br>
				When customers make purchases through nick.com (e.g., phone calls from “Nickelodeon Calls You” or games 
				from “Nick Arcade”) other than by using the Nick Arcade Game Card (which does not require our customers 
				to enter any personally identifiable information), customers are required to provide their full name, 
				billing and/or shipping addresses, email address, credit card number/expiration date and, only in the 
				case of Nickelodeon Calls You, a phone number. We also provide our customers the opportunity to send to 
				family and friends gift items purchased by the customer. Along those lines, we will send, on behalf of 
				customers who request it, emails to family or friends notifying them that someone has sent them a gift. 
				To do this, we ask customers to provide us with their family member or friend's first name and email 
				address. We only use this information to send the gift recipient the item(s) the customer has requested 
				their family or friend receive. During the checkout process, customers are provided the opportunity to 
				receive newsletters, sales and promotions from Nickelodeon. To be removed from the contact list at any 
				time, customers can elect to unsubscribe in the next email they receive from Nickelodeon. If customers 
				do not complete the order process (e.g., fail to enter a valid credit card number/expiration date or 
				fail to complete a purchase transaction) the information customers submitted during the order process 
				will not be captured by our systems. Once customers have successfully entered a valid credit card 
				number/expiration date and completed the order process, an account will be created and maintained 
				for customers. We use this information to process the customer's order and to send order confirmations 
				via email. We may also send our customers a print catalog based on the information provided. 
				We do not sell, transfer or share the information with third parties, except when the information 
				is transferred, disclosed and shared with our third party agent who uses the information solely to 
				handle and manage fulfillment and customer service. Our third party agent is not permitted to use 
				the information for other purposes and the third party agent has agreed to maintain the confidentiality 
				of such information.</p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Customer Service</font><br>
				Nick Arcade customers may email us their questions about the games and our site. Specific questions concerning 
				the Nick Arcade Game Card should be directed here: Nick Game Card Other than a parental email address, we 
				do not request that users submit any personal information online for customer service inquiries. We may 
				however ask for additional non-personal information to better help us respond to customer service questions. 
				We use the parental email address to communicate directly with parents about technology-related questions, 
				and provide them with answers that they and their child may find helpful. We do not sell, transfer or share 
				the parental email address with third parties, with the exception that the information is transferred, 
				disclosed and shared with our third party agent who uses the information solely to handle and manage 
				customer service, but cannot use it for other purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality 
				of such information. Once we or our third party agent have had a chance to provide email responses to 
				customer service email questions, the parental email address is deleted from our system. </p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Use and Disclosure of Information</font><br>
				Nick.com uses or may use personally identifiable information that kids provide for such purposes as 
				sending requested electronic postcards and email messages on their behalf, and conducting contests or 
				sweepstakes, and responding to their questions regarding our products and services. Nick.com currently 
				does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that kids provide, except from 
				time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged 
				by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). 
				Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it 
				for other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets relating to nick.com 
				are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be 
				transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information 
				to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our 
				<a href="/Terms/TermsandConditions.htm">Terms and Conditions</a> or to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, users of our website and others. </p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Information Received from the Nick Shop</font><br>
				The website for the Nick Shop, <a href="http://shop.nickjr.com/home/index.jsp" target="shop">www.shop.nickjr.com</a>, which is hosted and operated by a third party and is 
				independent and separate from nick.com, collects personal information about its users and shares and 
				transfers such information with us. We use the personal information we receive internally within Nickelodeon 
				but we do not sell, transfer or share this personally identifiable information with third parties except 
				from time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be 
				engaged by us specifically to handle and manage certain analysis of the data or other functions 
				(e.g., fulfilling contests and sweepstakes conducted on the Shop to which we are sponsors). 
				Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but 
				may not use such personally identifiable information for other purposes and have agreed to 
				maintain the confidentiality of any information they receive from us. </p> 
				<p>
				We are always looking for ways to improve your shopping experience with Nickelodeon. In order 
				to accomplish this goal, we may at times solicit additional personally identifiable information 
				from third party marketing organizations. This information, in addition to the information 
				you have already provided, will help us to offer new Nickelodeon products and services we believe 
				may be of interest to you. </p> 
				<p>
				Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets relating to nick.com are 
				transferred or sold to another entity, personal information we received from the Shop may be 
				transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personal information about 
				Shop users to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, 
				to enforce the Shop's Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property or safety of the 
				Shop's users and others. </p> 
				<p>
				In addition, we may use the personal information received from the Shop to provide you with our 
				print catalog, and to contact those Shop users who have asked that Nickelodeon contact them directly 
				about such things as sales and special offers. To request that we discontinue sending you our catalog, 
				please contact as at Nick Online, 1515 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, ATTN: Catalog Manager. To opt-out 
				of receiving sales and special offers, simply follow the unsubscribe information at the bottom of any 
				Nickelodeon newsletter that you receive.</p>

				is eliminated. We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine 
				information collected through cookies to any personal information that kids submit online when 
				participating in our activities. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by 
				indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.</p> 
				<p>
				The ads appearing on nick.com are delivered to you by a third party ad service provider. In the 
				course of serving ads, the ad service provider may place or recognize their own unique cookie on 
				your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to nick.com, 
				such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad. For more information about the third party

				Log data collected on web servers both within nick.com's control and under the control of nick.com's 
				third party ad service provider, who is required to maintain such data on a confidential basis, supplies 
				nick.com with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. Nick.com 
				uses such aggregate information to improve access to our content based on our visitors' browsers and 
				operating system types to make our content available to as many kids as possible. We do not link the 
				log data collected to the personal information that kids submit online when participating in our activities. </p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Parental Access</font><br>
				At nick.com, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. 
				That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that 
				allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information 
				deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. 
				<a href="http://www.nick.com/blab/site_wide/privacy/personal_info_form.jhtml">You can link to the form from here</a>. Nick.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting 
				information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian. </p> 
				<p>
				<font class="headerText">Security</font><br>
				Nick.com has taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected in the future 
				is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers 
				as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access. </p> 
				<p>
				Nick.com provides a "bumper page" when linking from nick.com to an advertiser's site, which lets 
				kids know they are going to an advertiser's site and reminds them not to give out information 
				online without getting permission from their parents.</p> 
				<p>
				Nick.com provides links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices 
				such as Nickelodeon Calls You and the Nick Shop, both of which are operated and hosted by third 
				parties. Nick.com provides internal "bumper pages" that inform kids that they have linked to another 
				site and instructs them not to give out information online before checking with their parents. These 
				other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which 
				may be substantially different from ours. We encourage visitors to other websites to review the privacy 
				policies and information collection practices of those websites. </p>
