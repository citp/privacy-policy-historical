We will ask you for your email address if you want us to contact you in this regard, to receive email update information and newsletters, or if you wish to pay online. You can delete or change your email address at any time or unsubscribe to particular types of email.

Moreover, the website gives you the opportunity to change your preferences about receiving conventional postal mails. To change preferences, login and select your name account from the top horizontal menu. If you have a web chat conversation, we will record a copy of that conversation and hold it against the membership number/student number/other identification id you used to log in to this website.
