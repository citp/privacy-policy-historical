                <b>The Information We Collect</b><br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                This notice applies to all information collected on the Everyone.net 
                Web site or submitted to Everyone.net at any time through any 
                Service Pages.<br>
                <br>
                Personally Identifiable Information—When visiting Everyone.net's 
                or any Client's Web site and signing up for or using Everyone.net 
                services through any Service Page, you may choose to supply Everyone.net 
                with information that identifies you personally. For <b>End-Users</b>, 
                this information may include your name and contact information, 
                gender, birth date, occupation and industry, shipping and billing 
                information, credit card numbers and other payment information, 
                behavior patterns, purchase history, and other information. For 
                <b>Clients</b>, this information may include the Client's name 
                and contact information, the Client's Web site information (name, 
                URL, visitors per day, page views per month, description, categorization), 
                payment information (check payee, SSN/Tax ID, bank information), 
                and user comments. We also collect <b>prospect information</b> 
                from our End-Users, which may include name and contact information 
                of individual(s) you think would be interested in our services.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                Aggregate Information—We collect non-identifying and aggregate 
                information to better design our Web site and services, and share 
                the aggregate data with advertisers and other third parties.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                Each of Everyone.net's Clients has access to information specific 
                only to that Client's site(s). Each Client will determine what 
                it will do with the collected information; however, each Client

                <b>Collection of Personal Information from Children under Thirteen</b><br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                Everyone.net does not allow children known to be under the age 
                of thirteen (13) to register for our services. We may momentarily 
                capture personally identifiable information for purposes of determining 
                whether a user is over the age of thirteen (13) and thus qualifies 
                to use our services. Where the user is under the age of thirteen 
                (13), such information is automatically deleted.<br>
                  
&nbsp;<br>
                <b>The Way We Use Information</b><br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                We use the information you provide about yourself or others to 
                complete the transaction for which the information is intended. 
                Such transactions may include: administering a service, such as 
                email, search, community, advertising sales, ecommerce; completing 
                an order; shipping a product; replying to support requests; or 
                contacting you if you have granted us permission to do so. Except 
                as provided in this Privacy Policy and the End-User Agreement, 
                we do not share this information with outside parties without 
                your permission except to the extent that is necessary to administer 
                the services we offer our Clients and End-Users or to comply in 
                responding to subpoenas, court orders or other legal proceedings.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                From time to time, we also use the information you provide about 
                yourself or others to inform you of additions or improvements 
                to the Everyone.net services. When supplying name and contact 
                information to Everyone.net, you can indicate your preference 
                to receive or not receive information and updates about Clients' 
                services or special offers from other companies through the Everyone.Benefits!™ 
                program or other registration processes.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                We may also use personally identifiable End-User information to 
                provide targeted content and commerce opportunities to End-Users 
                based on their demographic and behavioral information.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information 
                provided to us online in ways or for reasons unrelated to the 
                ones described above without also providing an opportunity to 
                opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b><br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure 
                the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate 
                physical, electronic, and managerial procedures reasonably designed

                <br>
                We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to secure personal

                &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                <b>How You Can Access or Update Your Information</b><br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <b>Clients</b> can access their personally identifiable information

                and Clients can also correct factual errors in their personally 
                identifiable information by sending us a written request that 
                credibly documents and explains the error.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                If you have submitted information on our site but do not currently 
                have an account with us, you can access and correct the information

&nbsp;<br>
                To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable 
                steps to verify your identity before granting access or making 
                corrections to your information.<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
