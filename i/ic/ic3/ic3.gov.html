					<h1>
						IC3 Website Privacy Policy
					</h1>
					<p>
						The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>
						(FBI) and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nw3c.org">National White Collar 
							Crime Center</a> (NW3C) co-sponsor the Internet Crime Complaint Center 
						(IC3). The NW3C is a private, non-governmental, not-for-profit organization, 
						which provides analytical support for white collar crime cases for state and 
						local agencies.
					</p>
					<h2>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h2>
					<p>
						The IC3 uses the data collected at this website to process complaint 
						information and to collect and store certain information. When you visit our 
						site, we may automatically collect and store the following information whether 
						or not you file a complaint:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Your domain name (for example, "xyz123abc-company.com" if you use a private 
							Internet account, or "yourschool.edu" if you are connecting from a university's 
							domain) and the IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer 
							when you go online) from which you access our website.</li>
						<li>
							The IP address, a number automatically assigned to your computer when you go 
							online, from which you access our website.</li>
						<li>
							The type of browser and operating system used to access our site.</li>
						<li>
							The date and time you access our site.</li>
						<li>
							The Internet address of the website from which you accessed our site.</li>
						<li>
							The pages you visit on our site.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different 
						sections of our site, and to help make our site more useful to future visitors. 
						We do not sell or transfer to third parties any of this information that we 
						automatically collect from every visitor unless it relates to a site security 
						matter as discussed below.
					</p>
					<h2>Information Collected from Emails and Web Forms</h2>
					<p>
						The IC3 uses the data voluntarily submitted by complainants at this website to 
						help victims of Internet-related fraud. Your complaint, should you choose to 
						submit one, is maintained and controlled by the NW3C. Thereafter, the IC3 may 
						pursue preliminary inquiries and information from the complaint, along with 
						other information developed at IC3, may be referred to a federal, state, local, 
						or international law enforcement or regulatory agency, as appropriate, 
						including the FBI. Whether your complaint is referred to another agency or not, 
						the data you voluntarily submit on the complaint form will be maintained by the 
						NW3C at the IC3 and be available for future retrieval and possible referral to 
						one or more enforcement agencies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Information solicited by IC3 on the complaint form assists personnel in 
						processing complaints. Disclosure of such information is strictly voluntary, 
						however, failure to provide certain information solicited will result in the 
						complaint not being properly registered. No action will be taken on incomplete 
						complaints. However, data submitted from incomplete complaints may still be 
						stored and maintained for potential retrieval and dissemination. Any complaint 
						information you affirmatively choose to provide to the IC3 may be referred to 
						one or more appropriate enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction over your 
						complaint. This may include agencies at all levels of government, including 
						federal, state, local, and international law enforcement and regulatory 
						agencies having administrative, civil, and/or criminal law enforcement 
						authority. Such referrals are the principal purposes for which the information 
						voluntarily submitted is intended to be used. The confidentiality of the 
						complaint information you provide may be affected by differing state law. As 
						such, we cannot guarantee that your complaint will remain confidential. People 
						who voluntarily choose to file a complaint do so knowing that all information 
						provided may be disseminated to one or more enforcement agencies, which may or 
						may not take action on the complaint. The IC3 does not decide which complaints 
						will be actively investigated by any agency. The IC3 cannot make any 
						representations or guarantees as to the action that may or may not be taken on 
						any complaint.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may volunteer to provide us personal identifying information, for example 
						your mailing address, in an electronic mail message or by filing a complaint. 
						Before you do so, you should know that various people might see the material 
						you submit. We may enter the information into a database and we may share it 
						with other agencies. Information collected may be used for responding to 
						complaints, as well as other authorized purposes.
					</p>
					<h2>Security and Consent to Monitor</h2>
					<p>
						For site security purposes, and to ensure that this service remains available 
						to all users, all network traffic is monitored in order to identify 
						unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause 
						damage or conduct criminal activity. To protect the system from unauthorized 
						use and to ensure that the system is functioning properly, individuals using 
						this computer system are subject to having all of their activities monitored 
						and recorded by authorized personnel and such monitoring and recording will be 
						conducted. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and 
						is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or 
						criminal activity, system personnel may provide the results of such monitoring 
						to appropriate officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change 
						information, or otherwise cause damage to this service, are strictly prohibited 
						and may be punishable under applicable federal law. Except for complainants who 
						voluntarily provide us with personally identifying information, and except for 
						authorized systems security purposes or enforcement investigations such as 
						discussed herein, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their 
						usage habits.
					</p>
					<p>
						Site information may be distributed or copied, subject to Sections 701 and 709 
						of Title 18, U.S. Code. Unauthorized use of the FBI seal, the words "Federal 
						Bureau of Investigation," the initials "FBI," or any imitation "in a manner 
						reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such [activity]...is 
						approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation" is 
						prohibited.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you file a complaint, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to 
						protect the information you submit. The information you provide is securely 
						stored offline.

					<h2>Cookies</h2>
					<p>
						A "cookie" is a file placed on your computer's hard drive or in memory by a 
						website that allows the site to monitor your use of the site, usually without 
						your knowledge. Navigation through the "Complaint" section of our site requires 
						the use of session cookies. This means that cookies are placed on your 
						computer's memory during the time you are filing a complaint. These cookies are 
						active only when a user is actually filing a complaint. Disabling cookies on
