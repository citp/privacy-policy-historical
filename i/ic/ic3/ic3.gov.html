collect from every visitor unless it relates to a site security matter as discussed
below.</p> <h2>
Information Collected from Emails and Web Forms</h2> <p>
The IC3 uses the data voluntarily submitted by complainants at this website to help
victims of Internet-related fraud. Your complaint, should you choose to submit one,
is maintained and controlled by the FBI and shared with the NW3C as a partner in
the IC3. Thereafter, the IC3 may pursue preliminary inquiries and information from
the complaint, along with other information developed at IC3, may be referred to
a federal, state, local, or international law enforcement or regulatory agency,
as appropriate, including the FBI. Whether your complaint is referred to another
agency or not, the data you voluntarily submit on the complaint form will be maintained
by the FBI and be available for future retrieval and possible referral to one or
more enforcement agencies.</p> <p>
Information solicited by IC3 on the complaint form assists personnel in processing
complaints. Disclosure of such information is strictly voluntary, however, failure
to provide certain information solicited will result in the complaint not being
properly registered. No action will be taken on incomplete complaints. However,
data submitted from incomplete complaints may still be stored and maintained for
potential retrieval and dissemination. Any complaint information you affirmatively
choose to provide to the IC3 may be referred to one or more appropriate enforcement
agencies that have jurisdiction over your complaint. This may include agencies at
all levels of government, including federal, state, local, and international law
enforcement and regulatory agencies having administrative, civil, and/or criminal
law enforcement authority. Such referrals are the principal purposes for which the
information voluntarily submitted is intended to be used. The confidentiality of
the complaint information you provide may be affected by differing state law. As
such, we cannot guarantee that your complaint will remain confidential. People who
voluntarily choose to file a complaint do so knowing that all information provided
may be disseminated to one or more enforcement agencies, which may or may not take
action on the complaint. The IC3 does not decide which complaints will be actively
investigated by any agency. The IC3 cannot make any representations or guarantees
as to the action that may or may not be taken on any complaint.</p> <p>
You may volunteer to provide us personal identifying information, for example your
mailing address, in an electronic mail message or by filing a complaint. Before
you do so, you should know that various people might see the material you submit.
We may enter the information into a database and we may share it with other agencies.
Information collected may be used for responding to complaints, as well as other
authorized purposes.</p> <h2>
