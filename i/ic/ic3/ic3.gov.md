## Information Collected from Emails and Web Forms

The IC3 uses the data voluntarily submitted by complainants at this website to help victims of Internet-related fraud. Your complaint, should you choose to submit one, is maintained and controlled by the NW3C. Thereafter, the IC3 may pursue preliminary inquiries and information from the complaint, along with other information developed at IC3, may be referred to a federal, state, local, or international law enforcement or regulatory agency, as appropriate, including the FBI. Whether your complaint is referred to another agency or not, the data you voluntarily submit on the complaint form will be maintained by the NW3C at the IC3 and be available for future retrieval and possible referral to one or more enforcement agencies. 

Information solicited by IC3 on the complaint form assists personnel in processing complaints. Disclosure of such information is strictly voluntary, however, failure to provide certain information solicited will result in the complaint not being properly registered. No action will be taken on incomplete complaints. However, data submitted from incomplete complaints may still be stored and maintained for potential retrieval and dissemination. Any complaint information you affirmatively choose to provide to the IC3 may be referred to one or more appropriate enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction over your complaint. This may include agencies at all levels of government, including federal, state, local, and international law enforcement and regulatory agencies having administrative, civil, and/or criminal law enforcement authority. Such referrals are the principal purposes for which the information voluntarily submitted is intended to be used. The confidentiality of the complaint information you provide may be affected by differing state law. As such, we cannot guarantee that your complaint will remain confidential. People who voluntarily choose to file a complaint do so knowing that all information provided may be disseminated to one or more enforcement agencies, which may or may not take action on the complaint. The IC3 does not decide which complaints will be actively investigated by any agency. The IC3 cannot make any representations or guarantees as to the action that may or may not be taken on any complaint. 

You may volunteer to provide us personal identifying information, for example your mailing address, in an electronic mail message or by filing a complaint. Before you do so, you should know that various people might see the material you submit. We may enter the information into a database and we may share it with other agencies. Information collected may be used for responding to complaints, as well as other authorized purposes.
