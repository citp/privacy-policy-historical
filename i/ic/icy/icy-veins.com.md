## Cookies

Cookies are used on Icy Veins for registration, traffic analysis, and advertisement purposes. The Guardian has a very good article written about cookies and we encourage you to read it [here](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies), as we feel that it would be pointless to try and write something ourselves that would end up being far inferior.

## Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Control Over Your Data

The _User Control Panel_ of your forum account gives you ample control about the private information that you wish to share with us. If you want to delete your forum account, you will need to send us an e-mail at [ privacy@icy-veins.com](mailto:privacy@icy-veins.com).

## Further Information

In conformity with French laws (article 23 of the law 78-17 from the 6th of January 1978, modified in 2004), the [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/en/) (French National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties) has been made aware of our user database and the nature of the data that we collect (declaration 1588056).
