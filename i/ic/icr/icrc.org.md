# Privacy policy | International Committee of the Red Cross

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflicts and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance.

The ICRC is committed to treating your personal data with security, respect and confidentiality: the processing of an individual's personal data carried out by the ICRC is performed in compliance with the ICRC Rules on Personal Data Protection, available [here.](https://www.icrc.org/en/publication/4261-icrc-rules-on-personal-data-protection)

This privacy policy describes why the ICRC collects your personal data, what information is made available to the ICRC and third parties when you visit icrc.org or official ICRC web pages on other sites, how ICRC uses, stores and protects that information. You will also find information on how you can exercise your data subject's rights. Any personal data disclosed to the ICRC will not be used in ways other than as set forth in this privacy policy.

## 1\. What personal data do we collect, and how?

 **1.1 Information you give us**

We obtain person information from you when you communicate or share information with us, subscribe for newsletters or one of our online services, register to an event, apply to a vacancy, and/or make a donation.

Depending on the specific purpose (see section 2 below), we may ask you to provide, inter alia, part or all of the following information: your full name, date of birth, email and/or postal address, phone number, position/title, company/organisation, dietary requirements, CV and references and motivation for applying to a vacancy.

 **1.2 Information we collect automatically: cookies and web analytics**

We automatically collect information through the ICRC website to help administer, protect, and improve our services.

Such information may include information regarding your device, such as your IP address, your operating system and your browser activity, location of the device accessing the website, traffic data (such as the pages you visited on our website, the time spent on the website, number of downloads from the website) and interactions with social media platforms (such as sharing of elements from the ICRC website to social media accounts). This information may be collected through the use of cookies and analytics.

Cookies are small data files made up of letters and numbers placed onto your computer or other mobile devices when you access the ICRC website. We use cookies to collect information about you to the extent necessary to ensure its website functionality and performance as well as for the purpose of targeting its audience and tailoring the content offered to the public both on its website and elsewhere.

For the purposes of marketing and retargeting, we make use of various advertising pixels, including Facebook and Twitter pixels: these are codes used to track website visitors. These data allow us to retarget those users with ads in the future in other platforms (for example on Facebook or on Twitter). This allows us to gain more insights about our audience, send targeted messaging to users who already know the ICRC, and track the effectiveness of our social advertising efforts.

If you do not wish to have cookies or pixels installed on your computer or mobile device, you can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies.

We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., to help us identify how people are using our website by processing the information mentioned above.

 **1.3 Links to third-party websites**

Our website provides links to third party websites and social media platforms - such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn - that will collect data about you if opened.

The ICRC does not govern the processing of personal data by such third parties, so we suggest that you refer to the privacy policies of these websites should you wish to have more information.

We will never rent or sell your personal information.

In case of sharing your data with third parties, we ensure as much as possible that the recipient has provided sufficient proof of compliance with the principles set out in the ICRC Rules on Personal Data Protection. This includes contractual obligations imposing a strict prohibition of using such data for purposes other than those specified above, and ensuring an adequate level of protection of the personal data shared from us.

## 4\. How long do we keep your data?

We will keep your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected them for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or archiving requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period, we take into account the nature and sensitivity of your personal data, potential risks of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data and the purposes for which we process your personal data.

When we no longer need your personal data, or when you request they be erased to stop receiving our marketing messages, we will delete your data.

## 5\. What measures do we have in place to protect and safeguard your information?

We take the protection of your personal data very seriously, and we therefore apply adequate technical and organizational measures to protect against accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, destruction or disclosure of data. Some examples of these measures are:

  * An official ICRC username and password are required in order to access our IT systems
  * Authentication and authorisation for the IT systems are based on roles and tasks
  * Our data center is physically protected and covered by our Privileges and Immunities
