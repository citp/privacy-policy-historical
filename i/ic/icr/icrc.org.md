# Privacy policy | International Committee of the Red Cross

There are instances where the ICRC requests information that does identify you personally for the purpose of providing you with specific services or of corresponding with you. Information that you supply in this way will not be shared with any third party except where needed to provide a requested service.

### How does the ICRC use the information?

The ICRC does not distribute, sell or rent user information to anyone. The ICRC uses the information collected about you to improve its understanding of web visitors and to send information that you have requested or that may be considered of interest to you. Some information identifying ICRC donors is forwarded to third parties for purely technical and administrative processing. These parties are not authorized to distribute, sell or rent user information.

### Who is collecting the information?

Any personal information that you disclose on the ICRC website is shared only with the ICRC, unless stated otherwise. For example, once you fill in and submit the form for making an online donation, you are redirected to the highly secure “Saferpay” environment of a partner company (Telekurs Card Solutions AG), where you are invited to enter your credit card details.

### With whom may the ICRC share the information?

As a general rule, the ICRC will not disclose any information identifying you personally, except with your permission or where required by law.

### What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?

Any information on new ICRC products that you register to receive will be sent to you electronically or by other means. The ICRC may also send you unsolicited e-mail messages it feels may be of interest to you. On some ICRC forms, such as that for online donations, you are invited to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information via e-mail about the ICRC. You will not be placed on any mailing list if you do not select this option.
