This Privacy Statement relates solely to the online information and collection practices of our website located at <http://www.icslearn.co.uk/> (“Web site”) and not to any subdomains of this Web Site.

We recognize that many visitors and users of this Web site are concerned about the information they provide to use and how we treat that information. This privacy statement has been developed to address those concerns. Your use of this Web site indicates that you have read and accept our privacy practices as outlined in this Privacy Statement.

## Information we collect

When you visit our Web Site, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis and (2) general user information that does not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse the web site.  In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you may not be able to access all of our web site’s contents and services.

Personally identifiable you choose to provide: We may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you content and/or services that you request.

You may provide us with details about yourself so that we can send you information about our products and services, and subscribe to our email newsletter. The details we ask for vary with the services that you request.  The on-line entry page will give you more information about how we might use and share those details and your choices.

If you wish to purchase our products or services through this website, you may need to provide us with information so that we can complete that transaction, including your credit card information.

You may be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, we may collect personal information from you (such as an e-mail address, system information and problem descriptions) in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.

Non-personally identifiable information we collect: Cookies/Web server logs: similar to other commercial websites, our website uses standard technology called “cookies” and web server logs to collect information about how our webs site is used.  Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site.  Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on the user’s hard drive.  Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our web site and the web sites visited just before and just after our web site.  This information is collected on an aggregate basis.  None of this information is associated with you as an individual.  You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preference or options menus in your browser.  However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser’s provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.

## How we use your information

We would like to use this personal data to provide you with information about our products and services and those of other Cengage companies.  You will be asked to confirm your agreement to us when you enter your details.

## How to access and/or modify your information or choices

If you visit our Web site and volunteer personally identifiable information, you may modify, update or delete such information at any time by visiting [www.icslearn.co.uk]() where you will have the opportunity to access and revise certain of your personally identifiable information and to update your preferences regarding what information you want to receive from us. You can do this by editing your profile through logging on and visiting <http://www.icslearn.co.uk/Profile>, or by visiting the Contact Us page and sending us an email.

## Links to Third Party sites

This Web Site contains links to third party sites as well as to other sites owned and/or operated by other Cengage companies.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party sites.  Please also be aware that the privacy policies of other Cengage sites may differ significantly from the privacy policy of this Web Site.  Therefore we encourage you to read the privacy statement of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

## Changes to our policies

From time to time, we may change our privacy policies. If we make a change, it will not affect the choices you have made about any information you gave us before that change. Any changes will be reflected in our Privacy Statements.

## Complaints

We are committed to working with your to resolve, quickly and fairly, any complaints you may have about privacy. If you have any questions or comments or you want a copy of our Data Privacy Complaints Policy, please contact us through one of the methods given in the ‘How to reach us’ section below.

## Security

We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as installing electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access. However, no system and no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide us and do so at your own risk.

We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to limit our liability to protect our rights, or to protect the rights and safety of the public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that limited purpose.

Unless exceptional circumstances apply, ICS will not charge individuals for processing any request or complaints.
