  **Drafting notes for free privacy policy**

  Our standard website privacy policy template, designed to aid compliance with data protection legislation. This includes disclosures about the categories of personal information that are collected, website cookies, the ways in which that personal information may be used, the persons to whom the personal information may be disclosed, the security measures used to protect the personal information, and much else besides.

  Our privacy policy document is designed for use in relation websites which collect and process personal information. Its purpose is to help website operators meet their obligations under UK data protection legislation.

  The privacy policy document covers, amongst other things, the following matters: details of personal information collected by the website; information about cookies used by the site; details of how personal information is used; details of specific situations in which personal information may be disclosed to third parties; information about extra-EEA transfers of personal data; and information about data security.

  Please read the notes accompanying the privacy policy very carefully. You will of course need to adapt the privacy policy to suit your website and business.

  It may not be suitable for websites which collect or process large volumes of personal information or sensitive personal information; nor may it be it suitable for websites which make complex or unusual or unexpected uses of personal information.

  In relation to cookies, the privacy policy includes a statement to the effect that users consent to the use of cookies. However, this will not necessarily satisfy the cookies consent requirement under the new cookie laws.

  **Section 1 - Introduction**

  _Section 1.1_

  “Personal information”: for day-to-day purposes, it is best to assume that all information which relates to a living individual constitutes personal information.

  _Section 1.2_

  How will you gain users’ consent to the use of cookies?

  The inclusion of this statement in your privacy policy will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as regards consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is included on the Information Commissioner’s website (http://www.ico.gov.uk).

  **Section 3 - Collecting personal information**

  _Section 3.1_

  What types of personal information will or might the website operator collect?

  (a) - What analytics data will you collect?

  (b) - What information will be collected from users who register with the website?

  (c) - What profile information is collected through the website?

  (d) - What information will be collected from users who subscribe to website services, email notifications and/or newsletters?

  (e) - What information is processed in connection with the provision of website services?

  You must list here the uses to which you will (or may in future) put personal data. We have suggested some common categories.

  As a general rule, where you plan to use personal information you have collected for the purpose of direct marketing, this should be made clear on the page where the information is collected, and you should ensure that this only happens if users opt in to the marketing (eg “Click here if you would like us to send you information by email about products which we think will interest you.”). There are, however, exceptions to this general rule. There are also rules about the content of direct marketing communications. If you are in any doubt about complying with your legal obligations in relation to direct marketing, you should seek professional advice.

For example, under the Defamation Act 2013 and the Defamation (Operators of Websites) Regulations 2013, a website operator may be required to pass personal data between a complainant and a poster - i.e. a person who posts on the website material which may be defamatory of the claimant.

  **Section 6 - International data transfers**

  Will any personal data be transferred outside the EEA?

  To which countries outside the EEA may personal data be transferred?
