This Policy explains the type of information that ICC collects from our Users of the Site, what ICC does with that information, and with whom ICC shares this information. The data controllers for your information include all of the above listed ICC entities, who are located at 500 New Jersey Avenue, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20001.

ICC may collect the name, phone and fax number, mailing and billing address, email address, log-in credentials (if you create an ICC account), payment card information (which is processed by third parties), and any other information provided by a User who contacts or interacts with ICC or any of ICC’s representatives through the Site, via email or otherwise, such as when a User: (a) submits an application for membership; (b) submits Information to become a volunteer; (c) submits Information at a seminar or other event; (d) registers for an account; (e) purchases a product through the Site; (f) submits Information through our forums; (g) provides Information to ICC outside of the Site; (h) participates in a sweepstakes, contest, or survey; or (i) engages in any other activity through the Site in which Information is provided to ICC.

ICC may also collect information you provide about your professional expertise and experience, including your title, company name, industry, technical specialty, trade and/or organization(s)/associations(s) to which you belong.

Please note that some parts of our site, such as message boards and advertising listings, allow you to post information that may be publicly viewable and can be collected and used by third parties without ICC’s knowledge.

**Automatically-Collected Information**

ICC and certain third parties that advertise or provide other services on the Site may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Site when you use the Site or certain Site services, or click on advertisements on the Site or in ICC periodicals, such as the eNews or Building Safety Journal. ICC and its partners and service providers may collect and analyze information This information is collected passively through the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, and similar technologies, and is further explained below. As described further below, ICC may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

**Browser Cookies:**  We and certain third party advertising partners may use “cookies.” Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your device. These cookies may be used:  (a) to improve or enhance your experience using the Site; (b) to deliver content, including advertising, specific to your interests; and (c) for other purposes, such as security and administrative functions. For example, cookies are used to store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not have to input those preferences every time you use the Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though different browsers may address cookies differently. Your browser may enable you to set your device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services or other features not being provided to you when you use that device.

**Flash Cookies:**  We and certain ICC advertisers may choose to use Flash cookies in advertisements available on or through the Site or in ICC periodicals. Flash cookies, also called Flash Local Shared Objects, are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store user preferences. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. More information concerning flash cookies, including how to remove them from your computer or device is available at [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html).

**Web Beacons, Pixels and Clear GIFs:**   We and our advertising partners may use web beacons, pixels and clear GIFs. These electronic technologies are transparent image files that, if used, allow us and our advertising partners to track Web site usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened a HTML email, how many times the email was forwarded and which links in the email were clicked. Unlike cookies, these technologies do not place files on your device. We and our advertising partners use information collected through Web beacons, pixels, and clear GIFs to improve and enhance our Site and measure the effectiveness of these communications with you. These technologies may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the Site or advertisements made by our advertising partners.

  * **Consent:** If ICC has a User’s consent to share any information, it may do so. For example, if a User agrees to have their information posted in the Members Only area of the Site, that User consents to ICC sharing their information with other ICC Members. We may also share a User’s information to provide that User with services or products that the User has requested.
  * **Agents:** ICC may utilize other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf, such as marketing new or additional ICC products and services, sending postal and email to Users, transmitting text messages requested by Users, processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, delivering products and services, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * **Sweepstakes and Contests:** When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, or sponsors and the use of that information may also be governed by those advertisers’, operators’, or sponsors’ privacy policies or practices.

### Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising

#### Online Analytics

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in Section 1.2 to help us analyze how users use the Site, including by noting the third-party Web site from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Tailored Advertising

Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Site may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Site in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Web sites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Web sites and use of our Site. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Site, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed (i.e., de-identified) version of your email address along with content that you share publicly when using the Site (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link,](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) the [TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/), or [Your Online Choices](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) if you live in the European Union to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Site to learn more about advertising practices on our Site.

To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google [Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Site, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising, but those ads will not be tailored based on your online activities over time. We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

When using a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.

### California Do-Not-Track Disclosure Requirements

ICC is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Site for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide above the Network Advertising Initiative’s “Consumer Opt-out” link, Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link, TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices page, and the Google opt-out link in this Policy. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.

### International Users

The information that is discussed in this Policy will be collected, processed, stored, disclosed and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law. Your information will be processed in the U.S. for the purposes described herein. If you are a non-U.S. User, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your information and disclose it to other entities outside your resident jurisdiction, as discussed in “How ICC Shares Your Information” above. Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services.

U.S. law may not provide the degree of protection for information that is available in other countries. By providing us with your Information, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy, understand it, agree to its terms, and agree to the transfer of such Information outside your resident jurisdiction.

If we provide any information about you to third party information processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Policy.

If a child under 13 submits “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) through any part of Site without valid parental consent, and we become aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information. We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.

### Retention of Your Information

We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.  Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.

### Security

ICC implements measures to protect information that it maintains. These measures vary on the sensitivity of the information that ICC collects and stores. However, no method of transmission over the internet or means of electronic or physical storage can be completely secure. Therefore, ICC makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of its security measures, and any information transmitted to or through the Site is at your own risk.

ICC will notify you in accordance with applicable law in the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your information. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your information.
