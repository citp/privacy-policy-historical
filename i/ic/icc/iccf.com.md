##  What if I fail to provide personal information?

We require you to provide us with any information to achieve one or more of the purposes described above, for example to enable us to administer correspondence chess tournaments. If you fail to provide certain information when requested, this will hinder our ability to administer tournaments, which may prevent you from entering or playing in correspondence chess tournaments.

##  How does ICCF protect personal information?

ICCF takes the security of your data seriously. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those officials who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.

##  What are my rights in connection with my personal information?

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

  * Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
  * Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing.
  * Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
  * Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.



If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact helpdesk@iccf.com.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you should contact helpdesk@iccf.com.

##  Who can I contact if I have any queries?

If you have any questions about how your personal information is used by ICCF, or wish to exercise any of your rights, please consult helpdesk@iccf.com

This notice may be updated at any time by the ICCF Executive Board, and we will provide you with a new privacy notice when we make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal information.

###  What is reasonable use of these data?

  * Sharing information with external partners,
  * Using contact details to send emails not related to one of the purposes described in this document.

As an ICCF official, we store some information about you in addition to the information we store about players. For example, we may store information about your role within the organisation, or the results of your TD review tests, etc.
