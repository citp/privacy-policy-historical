                  <blockquote> 
                    <h5>Anonymous Browsing Information </h5>
                    <p>Users can browse the Site without revealing personal information. 
                      In this context, our servers may collect your Internet Protocol 
                      address, your computer's operating system, the name of the 
                      domain you used to access the Internet, the Web site you 
                      came from and the Web site you visit next.</p>
                    <h5>Personal Information </h5>
                    <p>ICC may collect the name, company name, phone and fax number, 
                      mailing address, e-mail address, credit card number, and

                      that they have read this Policy, understand it, agree to 
                      its terms and authorize ICC to collect, use and disclose

                    </blockquote>
                  <p class="splashhead">How ICC Uses the Information</p>
                  <p>ICC uses the Information collected from its Users to respond 
                    to Users' questions and/or comments, provide products, services 
                    or information to Users, process a User's purchase, or provide 
                    related account status. Anonymous browsing and personal information 
                    may be used to gather broad demographic information used in 
                    marketing, promotion or similar activities. This information 
                    may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average 
                    time spent, page views and other statistics about Users of 
                    the Site. ICC also may use this data to monitor Site performance 
                    and to make the Site easier and more convenient to use.</p>
                  <p class="splashhead">ICC Sharing of your Information</p>

                    regarding its Users with third parties under the following

                    <li><b>Consent:</b> If ICC has a User's consent to share personal 
                      information, it may do so. This includes ICC Members who 
                      agree to have their Information posted in the Members Only 
                      area of the Site. <img src="/images/18x2px_linespacer.jpg" width="2" height="18" align="texttop"></li>
                    <li><b>Agents:</b> ICC may utilize other companies and individuals

                      orders, delivering products and services, and providing 
                      customer service. These third parties have access to Information

                      activity for purposes of marketing, promotion or similar 
                      activities. None of these statistics will identify Users 
                      personally.<img src="/images/18x2px_linespacer.jpg" width="2" height="18" align="texttop"></li>
