###  **9\. Cookies Policy**

  * General



Subject to your prior explicit consent where such consent is required by the applicable law in your jurisdiction, ICC Sites use “cookies” (i.e., small text files which are downloaded to a user’s device when visiting the ICC Sites) in order to improve navigation around the ICC Sites for the user and improve the quality of the ICC Sites.

By using <https://iccwbo.org/>, you consent to the use of cookies. If you do not consent to such use, you may disable these cookies through your browser.

  *  _Which cookies are we using?_
    * ICC uses cookies to save your logged in status and track that you have visited the site. This is useful for you and means that you do not have to login to access your preferences each time you visit the ICC website. This is also useful for us as it helps us gauge how many users have visited our site.



The Site also uses Google Analytics with the anonymizer function, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics collects first-party cookies, data related to the device/browser, IP address and on-site/app activities to measure and report statistics about user interactions on the websites and/or apps that use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses IP addresses to derive the geolocation of a visitor, and to protect the service and provide security to our customers. When anonymizer function is enabled, Google Analytics uses only a portion of an IP address collected, rather than the entire address. The last octet of the user’s IP address prior to its use and storage is removed, which means that the full IP address is never written to disk. This does slightly reduce the accuracy of geographic reporting.  
More information on Google Analytics is available under: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245>
