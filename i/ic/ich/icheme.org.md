### How we handle your personal information

Personal information is information or opinion that allows others to identify you. It includes your name, age, gender and contact details. It is the express wish of the Council that information relating to customers is available only to IChemE and not for direct access by third parties. 

### Collection of personal information

Generally, IChemE collects personal information directly from you. For example, we collect personal information when you:

We provide your email address to the Special Interest Groups of IChemE for the purpose of notifying you about events and activities of these groups.
