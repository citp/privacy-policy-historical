			<p>Herbalife International, Inc. complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss 
		Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, 
		use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. As 
		a sign of its commitment to provide a high level of protection for the personally-identifiable 
		information it collects and uses, Herbalife International, Inc. has certified that it adheres to 
		the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, 
		access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Herbalife 
		International, Inc.'s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you as to what information may be
		collected from you when you visit our website ("the Site") or when you become
		a Distributor or customer, how such information will be used by Herbalife and/or
		other persons or entities, with whom such information may be shared, your choices
		regarding the collection, use and distribution of such information, your ability to edit,
		update, correct or delete such information and the security procedures that we have
		implemented to protect your privacy.</p>
		
		<h2>NOTICE</h2>
		<h3>Collection of Information</h3>
		<p>At different occasions you may be asked for certain types of personally-identifiable
		information (e.g., your first and last name, mailing address, city, state, zip code,
		telephone number, email address, credit card number, bank information in connection
		with automatic deposit/debits, etc.). We hope you will provide us with this information.
		However, if you do not want to disclose your personally-identifiable information to us,
		please do not submit it. This does mean that in some cases we will not be able to
		provide you the service you have requested.</p>
		
		<p>We may also collect non-personally identifiable information from you when you visit
		the Site (e.g., your IP address, browser type, domain name, etc.). This information is
		collected and analyzed in the aggregate in order to improve the function and content of
		the Site.</p>
		
		<h3>Use of Information</h3>
		<p>We use the information that is collected about you for a variety of purposes. You will be
		informed about these purposes at the time of collection. In general, however, we foresee
		the following uses:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Website visitors</strong><br>
			Information about you may be used to add you to our email subscription list,
			provide your name to Herbalife Distributors in connection with your expressed
			interest in our products or business opportunity, analyze trends and statistics,
			enhance the operation of the Site, serve content and advertisements and send
			informational and promotional materials about Herbalife and other companies.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Customers</strong><br>
			Information about customers will in addition be used to provide customer service,
			confirm and fulfill your orders, ship your orders, and administer payments and
			possible problems and disputes with dispatchers and other service providers.</li>
	
			<li><strong>Distributors</strong><br>
			Information about Distributors will in addition be used to provide Distributor
			services, calculate earnings and bonuses, provide training on new products
			and services, and ensure compliance with the Distributor agreement and the
			company's rules and regulations.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>CHOICE</h2>
		<p>We have existing business relationships and may develop other relationships in the
		future with business partners. In these instances, we may share or otherwise allow
		access to information that is collected about you that will enable our business partners to
		contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest.</p>
		
		<p>At the time we collect your information you will be given the choice to accept or refuse
		the disclosure of your information for such marketing purposes, and for marketing by
		Herbalife.</p>
		
		<h2>ONWARD TRANSFERS</h2>
		<p>We may employ vendors to perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such functions
		include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, email administrative functions, processing
		credit card payments, and providing customer service. These vendors are under a
		contractual obligation to use confidential data received from Herbalife only for purposes
		that fall within the functions for which they were hired.</p>
		
		<p>We may disclose information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe
		that this is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities
		who may be harming you, us or others. We may also disclose information when we
		believe the law requires it.</p>
		
		<p>Lineage Reports, which information on Distributors in a Distributor's downline,
		including, but not limited to, name, address, identification number, telephone number,
		email address, fax number, level or rank, volume and sales statistics, are provided
		to Distributors in the strictest confidence and for the sole purpose of supporting the
		Distributors to further develop their Herbalife business. (The downline organization
		consists of all Distributors that were personally sponsored by a particular Distributor, and
		in turn, all other persons sponsored by those Distributors.)</p>
		
		<p>Lineage Reports, including all data contained therein, constitute confidential, proprietary
		trade secrets of Herbalife. Distributors may not collect, distribute or gather confidential
		information or personal or aggregate information about other Herbalife Distributors or
		their customers, except in connection with their downline and solely for the purpose of
		promoting their Herbalife business, and to manage, motivate and train their downline.</p>
		
		<p>You need to be aware that Distributors who receive the Lineage Reports may be based
		in countries that do not offer the same or a similar level of privacy protection as is
		available in your own country. However, Herbalife will take reasonable measures to
		ensure that the information is kept in confidence.</p>
		
		<h2>SECURITY</h2>
		<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect about
		you remains accurate, timely and secure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over
		the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and while we strive to protect your
		personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant its complete security. We shall
		not be responsible for harm that you or any person may suffer as a result of a breach
		of confidentiality in respect to your use of the Site or any information you transmit to the
		Site.</p>
		
		<h2>DATA INTEGRITY</h2>
		<p>Personally-identifiable information will be kept in active files or systems as long as
		needed to meet the purposes for which it was collected or as required to perform the
		contractual relationship with the Distributor and his/her up-line, and the commercial
		relationship with the customer.</p>
		
		<p>Herbalife will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the information is accurate and
		complete.</p>
		
		<h2>ACCESS OR CORRECTIONS TO YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
		<p>If you identify any inaccuracy in your personal information, or if you need to make a
		change or would like to verify such information, please contact us so that we may update
		your information in our records or you may go online to one of Herbalife's websites and
		update your own information. Our contact information is set forth below. We will use
		commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate all such requests.</p>
		
		<h2>COMPLAINTS</h2>
		<p>Herbalife takes privacy concerns seriously. If you believe that Herbalife has not complied
		with this Privacy Policy, you may write to the address below or call us. Please describe
		in as much detail as possible the ways in which you believe that the Herbalife Policy
		has not been complied with. We will investigate your complaint promptly. If you do
		not receive acknowledgment of your complaint, or your complaint is not satisfactorily
		addressed, you should contact the Office of the Chief Privacy Officer, which will serve
		as a liaison with Herbalife to resolve your concerns. Contact details for the Office of the

		<p>The Site is a general audience web site that is not specifically designed or targeted at

		personally-identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 13 has been
		collected at the Site, we will use such information for the sole purpose of contacting a
		parent or guardian of the child to obtain verifiable parental consent. If we cannot obtain
		consent after a reasonable period of time, or if when contacted a parent or guardian
		requests that we do not use or maintain such information, we will make reasonable
		efforts to delete it from our records. Upon request by a parent or guardian, Herbalife will
		provide a description of the specific types of personal information collected from a child
