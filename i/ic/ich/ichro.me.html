				<p>We collect information about how you use the Services, like which widgets you use and how often you use the Services, to improve them.

Certain personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address, may be transmitted to UserVoice along with non-personally identifiable information like your IP address and how you submitted a support request, even before you make a support request. We use this information to better respond to support tickets by seeing more about you and how you use the Services along with your inquiry. Your usage of UserVoice, even from inside the Services, is governed by <a href="http://ichrome.uservoice.com/tos">UserVoice’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

CloudFlare may collect non personally identifiable information about you although we do not directly provide any information to them. Any such collection is governed by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/">CloudFlare’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
