# Privacy Statement | IHG

The privacy and security of your information is very important to us. Whether you are booking a room or are a member of one of our loyalty programs, we want you to trust that the information that you have provided to us is being properly managed and protected.

We have prepared this Privacy Statement to explain more about who we are and how we collect and manage your information.

This Privacy Statement is issued by the InterContinental Hotels Group of Companies (collectively referred to as "IHG”, "we”, "us” or "our” in this Privacy Statement), which includes the direct and indirect subsidiaries of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and covers information collected and used by us in the course of our business. When we mention "IHG", "we", "us", or "our" we are referring to the relevant company in the InterContinental Hotels Group that processes your personal information.

Your information may also be collected and used by IHG-branded hotels. In most cases, these hotels are independently owned and their use of your information is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.

If you would like to learn more about IHG and our relationship with our IHG-branded hotels, click below.

ABOUT IHG

About our IHG-branded hotels

ABOUT IHG

We are a global hospitality company with IHG-branded hotels in nearly 100 countries. We predominantly franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent third-party owners. We also operate a number of programs that are related to our hotel business such as IHG Rewards Club, which is our core loyalty program.

About our IHG-branded hotels

We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, third-party owners. Most hotels operating under IHG’s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel (referred to as “Franchisees” or “Franchised Hotels”). If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will share your information with that hotel. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will be governed by their own privacy practices and is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.

We collect and use personal information if you make a booking through our reservation system, stay at an IHG-branded hotel, participate in one of our loyalty programs such as IHG® Rewards Club or interact with us through our corporate site. We generally collect this information directly from you, but in some cases we may collect your information from other sources. For example, we occasionally run promotions where we ask IHG Rewards Club Members to refer a friend to the IHG Rewards Club. In these cases, we always ask members to make sure anyone they refer is happy for their personal information to be passed to us, and to direct friends to read this privacy policy if they want to find out more about how we use their information. We also collect information through our third party service providers' use of technologies such as pixels, web beacons, tracking tools and similar technologies.  For more information please click here.

You do not have to provide us with your information although in some cases, if you do not, it may mean that you are unable to use our services. For example, we may be unable to complete any booking you may wish to make, or you may be unable to participate in our loyalty programs.

If you make a reservation or stay at an IHG-branded hotel

**Information we collect:** We collect information from you when you make a booking through our reservation system or stay at an IHG-branded hotel. Information collected during the course of the reservation and during your stay may include:

This information may be provided to us directly when you make a reservation through one of our global reservation offices, through our websites, directly at the hotel or through our mobile applications. In some cases we will receive this information from a third-party, such as when you book through an online travel agency or if information is provided directly to one of our Franchisees.

**How we use this information:** We use the information collected from you primarily to fulfill your hotel reservation. Prior to your stay this may include sending your information to the hotel or sending you pre-stay communications. Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your experience.

In some instances where we have your consent or where permitted under applicable law, we may send you marketing communications (which may include text messages or calls placed using autodialer technology) for products and services that we believe would be relevant for you. We also may use information related to your stay to display targeted advertisements on our websites or on third-party websites or to send you more relevant messaging. Additionally, we use this information for purposes of aggregated trend and statistical analysis to evaluate and improve our products and services, plan new hotel locations and services and other market research.

**Who we share your information with:** We will share your information with the hotel you are staying at to fulfill your reservation. We may also share your information with third-party service providers to provide services in relation to our business as well as to help us improve our products and services. For example, we might use a third party or a third-party product for the purposes of market research and data analytics, or share data with online partners we work with, so we, or our online partners on our behalf, can communicate with you and serve advertisements through their platforms or on other websites or platforms. In certain instances, subject to local consent requirements, third-party service providers may also assist us with various marketing campaigns. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also share your information with third parties, including our IHG® Rewards Club partners and other third parties, to extend special offers about their own products and services to you. These parties have agreed to comply with our privacy requirements. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our [global customer care offices](https://web.archive.org/hotels/us/en/customer-care/contact-us) or the IHG Privacy Office (details found in the "How to contact us" section).

We also share your stay information with other third parties in circumstances such as:

  * when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees, the public or IHG property;
  * when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process; or
  * in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction.

In some cases we may receive this information from a third party, such as one of our Franchisees. We may also collect information from other sources, such as publicly available information, to help identify what types of marketing information you may be interested in hearing about.

This may include:

  * Enrollment in the loyalty program;
  * The order and delivery of merchandise that you have redeemed online;
  * Sending you updates, account statements and other information relating to your participation in one of our programs or services;
  * Sending you marketing communications (which may include text messages or calls placed using autodialer technology) in relation to the products and services offered by IHG or its third-party partners or affiliates;
  * Providing you with personalized advertisements or communications for IHG products or services that we believe may be relevant for you; and
  * Analytics, statistical analysis and other research.



Although provision of much of the information requested is voluntary, the failure to provide certain information may impact and/or prevent our ability to offer you certain services.

We occasionally run promotions where we ask IHG Rewards Club Members to refer a friend to the IHG Rewards Club. In these cases, we always ask members to make sure anyone they refer is happy for their personal information to be passed to us, and to direct friends to read this privacy policy if they want to find out more about how we use their information.

**How you can manage your marketing preferences:** You can manage your preferences and decide what marketing communications you would like to receive from us in our online preference center. You can visit our preference center [here](https://web.archive.org/rewardsclub/us/en/account-mgmt/preferences) or find out more information here.

In addition you can opt out of collection of your personal information for use in targeted advertising. Please click here for more information on how to do this.

We also recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms as well as your preferences within your Rewards Club account.

**Who we share your information with:** During the course of your participation in our loyalty programs, it may be necessary to share your information with third parties such as our third-party partners and service providers for the purposes of operating the program and to provide you with the products and services that you have requested. We also use third-party service providers to assist us with managing, carrying out and improving our advertising. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also share your information with third parties, including our IHG® Rewards Club partners and other third parties, to extend special offers about their own products and services to you. These parties have agreed to comply with our privacy requirements. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our global customer care offices or the IHG Privacy Office (details found in the "How to contact us" section).

This information may be provided to us directly when you sign up for corporate news or shareholder documents on our corporate site.

These services may include the provision of shareholder documents. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our global customer care offices or the IHG Privacy Office (details found in the “How to contact us" section).

We will also share your information with other third parties in circumstances, such as:

  * when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees, the public or IHG property;
  * when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process; or
  * in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction.



There are other times when we collect and use personal information, for example if you choose to participate in one of our competitions or sweepstakes, sign up to receive our newsletters or other special offers and promotions, download one of our mobile applications or participate in one of our other services. In these instances, we will collect information from you for running and administering the respective competition, sweepstakes or service that you have elected to participate in. The information collected may include personal details such as your name and address as well as certain demographic information. In each case, we will collect, use and secure your information in a manner consistent with the general principles set out in this Privacy Statement unless we tell you otherwise.

We also collect information from you when you browse our website, use our mobile applications or participate in certain services at an IHG-branded hotel. In these instances, information such as your country information, internet protocol ("IP”) address, media access control address and other characteristics about your system or device may be automatically collected. This information is collected for functional purposes as well as to improve your experience when using these services.

More information on these practices can be found in the "Using our websites, mobile applications and other technology” section below.

We are committed to collecting and using your information in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

We will only collect, use and share your information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this.

This may be because:

  * you have provided your consent to us using the personal information;
  * our use of your information is necessary to perform our contract with you, for example, making and managing your booking and operating and providing services in connection with our Loyalty Program in accordance with the terms of our agreement with you;
  * our use of your information is necessary to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or otherwise meet our legal responsibilities;
  * our use of your information is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organisation, for example to operate and improve our services and to keep people informed about our products and services (including for profiling and targeted advertising) - in these cases we will look after your information at all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights and you have a right to object to processing as explained in "To object to how we use your information".



If you would like to find out more about the legal basis for which we process personal information please contact our offices (details found in the “How to contact us" section). If you have provided your consent to our processing of your information you can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting the IHG Privacy Office (details found in the “How to contact us" section).

As we operate via a global network of corporate offices, reservation and service centers, data centers and hotels, it may be necessary to transfer your information to a country outside of the country where it was originally collected or outside of your country of residence or nationality. The information that you provide us during the course of a reservation or through the provision of any other services may be transferred to any of our IHG-owned or affiliated entities and hotels around the world for the purposes of carrying out or facilitating these services. It will also be necessary to transfer this information to third parties, including, without limitation, our Franchisees, partners and third-party service providers.

Where we transfer information which originates in the European Union ("EU") to a country outside of the EU, we will take steps to make sure such transfer is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights:

  * transfers within the IHG Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the IHG Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the IHG Group;
  * where we transfer your data outside of the IHG Group including to other companies providing us with a service, we will obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your information. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States of America;
  * we will only transfer personal information to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights; and
  * any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully validated before personal information is disclosed.

We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to the records we hold.

  * **To access personal information**



You can ask us to confirm whether or not we have and are using your personal information and for a copy of your information.

  * **To correct / erase personal information**



You can ask us to correct any information about you which is incorrect. We will be happy to rectify such information but would need to verify the accuracy of the information first.

You can ask us to erase your information if you think we no longer need to use it for the purpose we collected it from you. You can also ask us to erase your information if you have either withdrawn your consent to us using your information (if we originally asked for your consent to use your information), or exercised your right to object to further legitimate use of your information, or where we have used it unlawfully or where we are subject to a legal obligation to erase your personal information.

We may not always be able to comply with your request, for example where we need to keep using your information to comply with our legal obligation or where we need to use your information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

  * **To restrict how we use personal information**



You can ask us to restrict our use of your information in certain circumstances, for example:

  * where you think the information is inaccurate and we need to verify it;
  * where our use of your information is not lawful but you do not want us to erase it;
  * where the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected but we need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
  * where you have objected to our use of your personal information but we still need to verify if we have overriding grounds to use it.



We can continue to use your information following a request for restriction where we have your consent to use it; or we need to use it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or we need to use it to protect the rights of another individual or a company.

  * **To object to how we use your information**



You can object to any use of your information which we have justified on the basis of our legitimate interest, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms to data protection outweigh our legitimate interest in using the information. If you raise an objection, we may continue to use your information if we can demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests to use the information.

You can also require us to stop using your data for direct marketing purposes.

  * **To ask us to transfer your information to another organization**



You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller (e.g. another company).

You may only exercise this right where we use your information in order to perform a contract with you, or where we asked for your consent to use your information. This right does not apply to any information which we hold or process that is not held in digital form.

  * **Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction**



You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Union.

We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.

We may ask you for proof of identity when making a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to make sure that we only disclose information where we know we are dealing with the right individual.

We will not ask for a fee, unless we think your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Where a fee is necessary, we will inform you before proceeding with your request.

We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may however take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We will let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. To help us respond more quickly, we may ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.

We may not always be able to do what you have asked, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are otherwise legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.

In some instances, we may have to change, modify or amend this Privacy Statement in order to comply with the evolving regulatory environment or the needs of our business. Subject to any applicable legal requirements to provide additional notice, any changes to this Privacy Statement will be communicated through our websites and mobile applications. However, if there will be changes made to the use of your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will take appropriate steps to notify you, such as by posting a notice on our website for 30 days prior to the changes taking effect or by emailing you.
