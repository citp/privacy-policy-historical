## A Primer on Data Regulation

The General Data Protection Regulation is an EU law, taking effect from 25th May 2018. It broadens the definition of personal data to include anything unique to an individual. It also restates the requirements to have a solid legal basis for processing personal data and being transparent to data subjects (i.e. people) about what processing is taking place.  
Personal Data is therefore an EU term, including things like name, email address, but also unique cookie IDs and IP addresses
