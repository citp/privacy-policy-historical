You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that anonymous information to our partners.

**Content you provide through our features:** We collect and store content that you post, send, receive and share while using our Services’ features. This content includes any information about you that you may choose to provide. Examples of content we collect and store include: The comments you write, the product Collections you create, the messages, files and links you send to other users via our messaging feature.

Before making the first payout to the Earner, we ask to provide the personal identification document to verify the identity of the Earner. We may store this Personal Information for a reasonable amount of time needed to process the verification. We delete the personal identification document within a reasonable amount of time after the verification is completed. When verifying Earners, we may ask for additional information, such as links to social media accounts or examples of work in progress to verify that contributing artists are selling their original artwork.

## Legal bases for processing (for EEA individuals)

As an individual in the EEA (European Economic Area), we collect and process information about you where we have legal bases for doing so under EU laws. We only collect and use the information when:

  * We need it to provide you the Services, including operating the Services, provide customer support and personalize features as well as for safety and security processes.
  * It serves a legitimate interest _(which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, for marketing and promotion and to protect our legal rights and interests._
  * You have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
  * We need the information to comply with legal obligations.



If you have given consent to our use of your information for a specific purpose, you can change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. You have the right to object to the use of your information, but this may mean that the Services are no longer available.

Our third-party service providers may be located outside EEA which means their processing of Personal Information will involve transferring of data outside the EEA. When data is transferred outside EEA we ensure protection using the following safeguards:

  * We only transfer Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of Personal Information by European Commission. Please see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.
