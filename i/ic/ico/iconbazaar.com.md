  2. **Use of collected information**  
The information collected by IconBAZAAR will be used for internal tracking and monitoring of our server activity, and demographic studies of our user base.   The information we collect will not be used to create customer profiles based on browsing or purchasing history.   We do not supplement information collected at our Web site with data from other sources and we do not share information we collect with any third party 

Information is collected by third parties through our web site by means of rich-media advertising, text link advertising, sale merchandise (offsite), and shareware donations (offsite).

These third parties will use the information they collect as follows:

We offer links to other Web sites. Please note: When you click on links to other Web sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies.   Their standards may differ from ours.   If our policy on information collection or uses changes, we will advise you, the user, by posting any relevant or new information here as it becomes available. 
  3. **Accuracy**  
IconBAZAAR maintains the accuracy of our information by emailing, telephoning, faxing or mailing users who have made purchases from us, contracted us for custom design projects or other services, and made shareware donations to our web site.   These services are not offered as opt-in/opt-out services either by IconBAZAAR or our service providers.   Once you have been added voluntarily to our client database, by the act of making a purchase through our web site, by licensing materials from the IconBAZAAR, by making shareware donations to our web site, or by otherwise contracting for any services delivered by IconBAZAAR, this information becomes proprietary to IconBAZAAR and will be maintained indefinitely by IconBAZAAR in a reputable manner consistent with high moral and ethical standards. 
  4. **Problem Resolution**  
If problems arise, users may contact IconBAZAAR in writing only (as a matter of legal record) at 333 Washington Drive, Clemmons, NC 27012-7258.   We are committed to resolving disputes in a cordial and businesslike manner within a reasonable timeframe. 
  5. **Data Storage and Security**  
IconBAZAAR protects locally stored user information on firewalled systems which are not accessible to any person who is not employed by IconBAZAAR.   Currently, the only user information locally stored at our physical place of business resides on one computer.   This computer runs Windows XP SP2 with SpyBot - Search and Destroy, ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall among other security programs, accesses the Internet from behind a Linksys 4-port router (with internal firewall), and is BIOS password and Windows Logon password protected. 

Our web site is hosted by [PerlCoders](http://www.perlcoders.com/) on a dedicated server with firewalls in place.   At present, the only user information stored on the remote system hosted by PerlCoders is contained in our internet log files.   Access to these log files is available only through our server by use of an encrypted username and password.
