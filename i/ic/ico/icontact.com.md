This “Privacy Policy” is incorporated by reference in iContact LLC’s End User Service Agreement (“EUSA”) and its Terms of Use, posted at [www.icontact.com](https://www.icontact.com/ "Email Marketing Software - iContact"). We have created this Privacy Policy to reflect our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your personal data. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit [www.icontact.com](https://www.icontact.com/ "Email Marketing Software - iContact") (“Site”) and when you use our services, as well as information collected from other sources, such as information you provide at tradeshows or seminars or to our business partners.

#### What Type of Data Do We Collect?

Generally, we collect or maintain the following categories of data:

  *  **Customer Registration Data** : when a customer, whether an individual or an entity, activates our services, creates an account at the Site or registers at an event we collect account information from that customer, which we refer to in this Policy as “Customer Registration Data.” The Customer Registration Data we collect includes individual or contact name, company name, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, as well as information about services requested and payment information, such as credit card number, expiration date and billing address. We also assign customers a unique username and password to access their account information through the Site;
  *  **Customer Message Recipient Data** : we also maintain data that has been provided to us or uploaded to the Site by our customers, which we refer to in this Policy as “Customer Message Recipient Data.” Typically, Customer Message Recipient Data relates to individuals or entities who have opted in to receive email messages or other types of communications from our customers, and may include name, e-mail address, contact information, and other information. Under our [Anti-Spam Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/anti-spam-policy "Anti-Spam"), customers must obtain a recipient’s consent prior to sending the recipient an e-mail through our service. For more information, please see the section below entitled “Why Do You Receive Marketing Communications.” We only use Customer Message Recipient Data on behalf of and under the instructions of our Customers.

#### Why Do You Receive Marketing Communications?

Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information to the owner of such third party websites. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.

#### How Do We Use Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies?

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by iContact and our partners, such as marketing service providers, partners, vendors, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used to tailoring offers, promotions and content and in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

When you interact with the Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs and Flash LSOs to track user activity and collect Site Data. In addition, we may combine the Site Data we collect with the other data we collect.

 **Cookies** : When you come to the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. In addition, we may permit certain third parties to place cookies through our website.

  *  **Session Cookies**. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. iContact uses session cookies to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and to verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
  *  **Persistent cookies**. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. iContact uses persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, to identify the fact that you are an iContact customer or prior Site visitor, and to display advertising, both on our Site and on third-party sites.



**Disabling Cookies** : Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, you must enable cookies in order to use our services.

 **Flash LSOs** : We may use local shared objects, such as HTML5 or Flash also known as Flash cookies, to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit, or to display content based upon what you view on our Site. Third Parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties’ use of data. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot typically control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash cookies through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel.” Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties. We have no access or control over these types of analytics and tracking. Our privacy policy does not cover these analytics and tracking.

As is true of most web sites, we also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Some of this information may be appended to other information we may have collected about you.

#### What About Third-Party Ad Networks?

We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

**Updated March 14, 2013**

iContact LLC (“iContact”) understands and values the importance of individual privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is designed to inform our European Customers of: (1) how we collect, use and disclose Personal Data that is transferred to iContact in the United States; (2) individuals’ choices with regard to how such Personal Data will be used or disclosed by iContact; and (3) individuals’ other rights with regard to that Personal Data.

This Policy complies with the Safe Harbor Principles as agreed upon by the U.S. Department of Commerce with the European Commission, as well as those agreed upon with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland (collectively, “Safe Harbor Principles”), which can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

This Policy applies only to the processing of Personal Data (defined below) that iContact receives in the United States from its European Customers (defined below). Most iContact Customers are businesses, not individuals. However, iContact may also receive Personal Data about individual Message Recipients (defined below) on a Customer’s e-mail marketing or contact lists. We process the Personal Data of a Customer’s Message Recipients only on behalf of and under the direction of the Customer, and the collection, use and disclosure of such data is subject to the Customer’s privacy policy.

This Policy does not cover data through which individuals are no longer identifiable, or identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost or labor, or data combined with pseudonyms rather than actual names or other identifiable information.

Capitalized terms in this Policy are defined at the end of this Policy.

#### 2\. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA

iContact may collect Personal Data: (1) directly or indirectly from Customers; (2) from Third Parties; (3) from iContact affiliates in Europe, or (4) through other means.

Our Customers may opt-out of being contacted for such purposes by e-mailing [customercare@icontact.com](mailto:customercare@icontact.com "customercare@icontact.com").

#### 3\. DISCLOSURES/ONWARD TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA

These Third Parties must agree to use such Personal Data only for the purposes for which they have been engaged by iContact and they must either: (1) comply with the EU-US Safe Harbor principles or another method permitted by the EU Data Protection Directive for transfers and processing of Personal Data outside of the EU; or (2) agree to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy. iContact may also disclose Personal Data for other purposes or to other Third Parties, when a Data Subject has consented to such disclosures.

The disclosure of a Customer’s Message Recipient Personal Data is subject to the Customer’s Privacy Policy. iContact will not use or disclose such Personal Data other than as directed by the Customer.

iContact does not intentionally collect Sensitive Data from Customers. Except as stated otherwise herein, iContact will not disclose Sensitive Data to any Third Parties, other than its service providers as stated above, unless it receives a Data Subject’s express consent.

Notwithstanding the above, should iContact receive Sensitive Data, it may disclose Sensitive Data (and Personal Data) without prior express consent, where such disclosure or use: (a) is in the vital interests of the Customer, or another person; (b) is necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses, to obtain legal advice, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending iContact’s legal rights; (c) is required to provide medical care or diagnosis; (d) is necessary to carry out iContact’s obligations under applicable employment or other laws; (e) is data manifestly made public by the Customer; or (f) as otherwise required by law.

#### 5\. DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY

Data Subject’s may request that iContact correct, amend or delete such data where it is inaccurate. iContact will grant such requests, except where doing so would cause unreasonable burden or expense, or pose a risk to such individual’s privacy.
