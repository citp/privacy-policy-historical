# Privacy Policy | iContact - Email Marketing Software

#### Effective Date: September 9, 2009

## iContact Privacy Policy

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit this site, [www.iContact.com](http://www.icontact.com/ "www.iContact.com") ("Site"), and information collected from other sources, such as information you provide at tradeshows or seminars or to our business partners. 

### Data Definitions

Generally, we collect and maintain three categories of data: a) account information generated when an individual or entity activates our services - which generally includes contact information and payment information (we call this our "Customer Data"); b) data provided by our customers about individuals or entities to whom our customers would like to send email messages or other types of communications (we call this "Customer Recipient Data") and c) data about visitors to our Site who may or may not also be our customers ("Site Visitor Data"). 

Although the majority of our customers are businesses, some of the account information submitted to us, and maintained by us, could be used to identify or relate to an individual ("personal data") rather than a business. 

### What We Do With the Data Collected on Our Site

As explained above, our services are intended for businesses, not consumers. If you have provided your contact information (which may include personal data) to us, we may contact you for marketing purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone. When you activate an iContact account (including a trial account), you expressly consent to receive marketing communications about iContact’s services via direct mail, email (at the email address you provided when activating your account), telephone (at the number you provided when activating your account), pre-recorded messages (at the number you provided when activating your account), text messages (if you provided a wireless telephone number), instant messages or other communications methods. We may also use personal and non-personal (e.g., business-related) data for other purposes, including but not limited to: 1) providing the services you request and 2) providing technical support.

We do not sell or rent Customer Data, Customer Recipient Data or Site Visitor Data without advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. The data we collect is available: 1) to customer who sign up for our service offering(s); 2) to iContact employees who access and manage this information for legitimate business purposes such as customer service, marketing or billing purposes; and 3) to our service providers for purposes of providing functions or services related to our customers’ accounts (for example, billing functions). 

### Why Do You Receive Email From Us?

If you have received one or more e-mails from us, it means that (a) your email address is on our list of customers, trial users or prospective customers, (b) you have provided us your email address so that we could contact you, and/or (b) you have an existing business relationship with one of our customers and have expressly shared your email address with such customer for the purpose of receiving emails about such customer’s products or services (in other words, you have "opted-in"). It is possible that our customers may use our services to send unsolicited email, however. If this occurs, please contact us immediately at [spam@icontact.com](mailto:spam@icontact.com).

### How Can You Stop Receiving Emails From Us?

Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from the lists your are subscribed to, or to change your expressed interests. If you do not wish to receive additional emails from iContact, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email.

### How Do We Secure the Personal Data We Collect?

We use technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. No data transmissions over the Internet, however, are guaranteed to be completely secure. While we strive to protect your data from unauthorized use or disclosure, iContact cannot warrant or guarantee the security of the data that you provide to us. 

### Questions About Your Account

If you have any questions about your account or how we use the data we collect and maintain in the course of providing our services, please contact us at 866-936-5680.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Any changes to this Policy will be posted here, so please check this page regularly and make sure to check the effective date of the policy above. If you have any questions or concerns about the changes, please contact us at 866-936-5680.
