																protection of your data is one of the key success criteria by which we measure 
																our performance. And we believe that these policies should be fully disclosed 
																to the public. This privacy policy is based on our belief that customer 
																information should be handled with the utmost respect and should only be shared 
																with other organizations only with the express authorization of our customers. 
																Simply put, we do not sell customer lists or related customer information to 
																other companies.

															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>1. Information We Collect</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you 
																with a smooth, efficient, and personalized experience while using our services. 
																This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your 
																needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier and quicker.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online 
																registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact 
																information (e.g. e-mail address) and some other information relating to your 
																professional employment (e.g. name of the company you work for, your position 
																there). We automatically track certain information about you based upon your 
																behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our 
																users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve 
																our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Using the Site's web server log files, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, 
																track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
																use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. This 
																information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on 
																our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or 
																not), what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address etc.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our site. We may also offer 
																certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies 
																can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. 
																Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are 
																"session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a 
																session. The other type of cookie we use is a 'persistent' cookie. This stays 
																on your hard drive and we use this to automatically identify who you are. We 
																use this cookie so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit 
																the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personally 
																identifiable information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us 
																to tie the cookie to your personal information. We do this to allow us to let 
																you know on the homepage what has changed on the site since your last visit. We 
																also use the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our 
																most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your 
																browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain 
																features on our site. For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log 
																in manually each time you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember 
																who you are. Some of our business partners (e.g. net-filter.com; hitbox.com) 
																use cookies on our site. These are used to monitor site performance and to 
																measure site traffic and usage. We have no access to or control over these 
																cookies. 
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Surveys &amp; Contests. From time-to-time our site may request information 
																from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. newsletter). 
																Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user 
																therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
																requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during 
																registration) and supplementary information on your professional interests, 
																opinions and preferences (e.g. choice of software, working practices, opinions 
																on industry issues, feedback on Icovia products and the Icovia web site). We 
																will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish 
																winners' details on the site though on request we will provide details of any 
																winners' name and organization. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we 
																will share information given by entrants with the sponsor.
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Payment Processing. In order to process payments online we require the billing 
																address for the credit card used and our external payment provider, 
																CyberSource, requires your credit card details. For details of how your 
																information is used, please see following section.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>2. Our Use of Your Information</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">We use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing 
																and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse site usage, to improve our 
																content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and 
																services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor 
																it to meet our users' needs.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">We use your e-mail address to send you newsletters or other communications 
																that you have requested from the Site. Out of respect for our users we offer an 
																opt-out (see section 3).
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we 
																obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any 
																disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we 
																may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Payment Processing. We take online payments for our subscription and 
																membership services. We use CyberSource as our external payment provider. 
																Icovia is also a licensee of GeoTrust, an industry leader providing secure 
																online transactions. In addition to the information outlined above, we require 
																the billing address of the credit card you use so that we can pass this to 
																CyberSource who check the address against the cardholder's details for security 
																purposes. We store these billing details on our servers in case we need to 
																contact you in the future regarding payments. CyberSource requires that you 
																provide your credit card details to process the transaction. This is done on a 
																secure CyberSource server using SSL (secure sockets layer) provided by 
																GeoTrust. In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, card details may 
																be accessed by Icovia for the sole purpose of performing further checks. Icovia 
																does not retain these details. These details are stored securely by CyberSource 
																in order to process future payments you may make, but CyberSource does not use 
																your information for any other purpose.
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Your Personal Information is stored in our databases, which are located in the 
																United States. Please note that the information you enter may at some time be 
																transferred outside the United States for the purposes of processing by Icovia 
																or any of its affiliates. By submitting your information, you consent to this 
																transfer.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>3. Opt-Out of Email Communications</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">If at any stage you wish no longer to receive any e-mails that you receive 
																from the site you can stop them by changing your Icovia account preferences 
																section under "My Account" which can be found by logging in to 
																http://design.icovia.com/login. On this page you can opt out by unchecking the 
																box marked "keep me updated about Icovia product updates and announcements." 
																All product update and announcement emails we send to our customers also 
																include a link to opt out at the bottom of the email.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure 
																that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable 
																information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this 
																Privacy Policy.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to 
																disclose information to the government or third parties under certain 
																circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
																transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) 
																disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government 
																officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in 
																connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, 
																or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">As a general proposition, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable 
																information about you to any third party.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Advertisers. We may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose 
																such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing and 
																promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these 
																entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">Legal Requests. Icovia cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other 
																third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. Local, 
																and international law enforcement agents can request and may receive your 
																personally identifiable information.
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Suppliers and Other Service Providers. From time to time we use third party 
																Suppliers and Service Providers to facilitate our services. Where any Service 
																Provider collects information directly from you (such as the situation where we 
																ask a Service Provider to conduct a survey for us) you will be notified of the 
																involvement of the Supplier or Service Provider, and all information 
																disclosures you make will be strictly optional.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>5. "Email a Plan" Feature</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Icovia offers a feature whereby you can e-mail a copy of an Icovia plan to a 
																friend or colleague. This will involve entering the e-mail address of your 
																friend. We do not use the e-mail addresses you enter for any purpose other than 
																to send your e-mail. We do not store, rent or sell these e-mail addresses.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>6. Control of Your Password</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your 
																Icovia password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If 
																you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your 
																personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding 
																actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised 
																for any reason, you should immediately change your password by visiting the 
																Icovia account preferences section under "My Account" which can be found at 
																http://icovia.com/login.aspx. If you wish to change your password for any 
																reason, you can do so at any time at this location.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>7. Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">You can at any time review and change the information you submitted during 
																registration by visiting the Icovia account preferences section under "My 
																Account" which can be found at http://icovia.com/login.aspx. You must promptly 
																update your information if it changes.
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">You can at any time ask to see and have removed any information that we have 
																stored on you, though we reserve the right to charge for this service. If you 
																would like your personal information removed, requests should me made in 
																writing and mailed to the Icovia office (see section 11). Please include your 
																email address and phone number so we can respond to your request. We will 
																retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some 
																circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
																our User Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed 
																from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up 
																our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally 
																identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in 
																response to your requests that it be removed.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>8. Other Information Collectors</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document 
																only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To 
																the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they 
																are other members of the Icovia community, other web sites or other parties, 
																different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal 
																information you disclose to them.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>9. Security</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad10_bottom">In order to process and protect your credit card details, our payment provider 
																CyberSource uses SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. Icovia is also a 
																licensee of GeoTrust, an industry leader providing secure online transactions.
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">We use best practices in the Icovia application and web site to safeguard the 
																confidentiality of your personal identifiable information but we do not use 
																encryption (such as SSL) or firewalls to further protect the information as it 
																travels across the Internet. This is because we do not believe that, apart from 
																the credit card information processed by CyberSource, the personal information 
																we currently collect warrants such measures and the accompanying loss of speed 
																experienced. You should be aware that "perfect security" does not exist on the 
																Internet.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>10. Changes to Privacy Policy</b>
															</div>
															<div class="pad40_bottom">Icovia believes in procatively informing its customers and users of changes in 
																its privacy policy and will make every effort to notify its customers in 
																advance of changes that affect them.
															</div>
															<div class="pad18_bottom"><b>11. Contact Information</b>
