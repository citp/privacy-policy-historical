## 2\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION AND USE BY STATIGRAM

### 2.1 Collection of information

You are free to browse the Site without revealing any personal information making it possible to identify you. However, once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. 

We collect two types of information from Users/Organizers of the Site: “Automatic Anonymous Information” (hereafter known as “AAI”) and “Identifiable Personal Information” (hereafter known as “IPI”). We process AAI and IPI differently, and the following articles describe both **AAI** and **IPI** and indicate how each type of information is collected and used by Statigram.

The Site/Contest Tool make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behaviour. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the Site/Contest Tool, and to better understand and satisfy our visitors. This information may include the browser you use, your IP address or other information. This information is referred to herein as the AAI.

IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Site’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your e-mail address, billing address, and/or other personal information. You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Site, to Publish your Content, to create an Account, to organize a Photo Contest, to participate in a Photo Contest or to make comments. When possible, we tell you which fields of information are required and which are optional. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Site’s functions mentioned above.

Statigram does not collect or keep information on Users/Organizers whom we know to be under 18 years of age.
