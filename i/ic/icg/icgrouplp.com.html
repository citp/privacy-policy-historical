IC manages various aspects of consumer based promotions, including contest administration and prize fulfillment.&nbsp;</p> <p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of what kinds of information we may collect about you when you participate in a promotional offer IC is administering, how we typically use that information and who we disclose it to. Our Privacy Policy applies only to IC and not to other companies' or organizations' web sites to which we link. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites. Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected, used and disclosed by IC.&nbsp;</p> <p>This privacy policy outlines IC's commitment to the protection of personal information under our control, in accordance with The Personal Information and Electronics Documents Act (PIPEDA). IC adheres to Ten Privacy Principles, established by PIPEDA, to ensure personal information is protected.</p> <div class="privacycolumn1"> <h2 class="fontface">What information does IC collect about you?</h2> <p>
In order for IC to administer a promotion, it must collect some personal information. We obtain all of our information about you directly from you, via online entry forms, surveys, rebate/claim forms and registrations. The information that we collect may include your name, date of birth, address, telephone number and e-mail address.&nbsp;<br> <br>

IC uses the personal information that it has collected to contact selected entrants and to fulfill the Promotional Sponsor’s obligations in accordance with promotional rules and regulations.&nbsp;<br> <br>
In particular, IC uses the personal information collected through submissions of entries to games or contests and submissions of responses to survey questions for the purpose of awarding prizes or fulfilling rebates offered by the game, contest or survey. We also use these submissions to come up with the game or survey results, and we may publish those results in an aggregated format on our web sites and/or provide them to the Promotional Sponsor.
