# Delicious Privacy Policy

As of April 27, 2011, Delicious is owned by AVOS.

During a transition period, the Delicious site will continue to be run by Yahoo! and your Delicious account information will be subject to [Yahoo!'s Privacy Policy for Delicious](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/delicious/). You will have the opportunity to transfer your account information to AVOS during this transition period, and if you agree to the transfer, your account information will, once transferred, be subject to [AVOS’s privacy policy](http://avos.com/privacy).

At Delicious, we respect the privacy of the users of our website and services and are committed to protecting it. We have created this policy to demonstrate our commitment to you and to help you understand it.

Please Note: On December 09, 2005, Delicious became part of the Yahoo! network of products and services. Information collected by Delicious will continue to be subject to the Delicious privacy policy, posted here. To learn more about how Yahoo! uses other information not collected on Delicious please see read the [Yahoo! Privacy Policy](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/).

We may collect personal information, including email addresses, when individuals register to use the Delicious website and services, post a link to the Delicious website or submit questions, comments or bug reports. We may also, at times, collect our users' IP addresses and information regarding our users' use of our website and services. We may use such IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, track movement within our website and, if necessary, deny service in accordance with our Terms of Service. We may also collect information related to the referring URL, access times and browser type. Unless required by law, we will not share our users' personal information, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and usage information, except with their consent or in aggregate or anonymous form, with third parties.

In order to offer and provide optimized and personalized services, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information about our users. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user's browser from a web server and is eventually stored on a user's computer hard drive.

Yahoo! uses [web beacons](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/webbeacons/details.html) to research certain usage and activities of the Yahoo! and Delicious web sites. The information collected through these web beacons is used to find out more about our users, for more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and to make Delicious better. No personally identifiable information from your Delicious account is collected using these web beacons.

Our services give you the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us. We will never automatically send you information/offers you do not want. You must choose to receive them.

Visit your [Delicious Settings](https://secure.delicious.com/settings) to edit your profile and other information. When you're signed in, Delicious page headers will include a link to Settings. You can delete your Delicious account through your Settings.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that reason, we will not collect age information for users under 18 years.

Delicious reserves the right to modify all or some of this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on our website so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information only in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected unless we have received explicit authorization from the appropriate user(s) to do otherwise.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this website or your dealings with this Delicious, you can send an e-mail, in English, to privacy@del.icio.us.
