## AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING

If you apply to us for a product, your application may be processed by an automated decision-making process which may carry out credit and affordability assessment checks to determine whether your application will be accepted. Where these automated processes suggest that your application should be rejected, we will manually review your application before making a final decision. We may also use automated processes to decide credit limits.

We may also carry out automated anti-money laundering and sanctions checks. This means that we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if the processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers, is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.

If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk: (i) we may refuse to provide the services you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you; and (ii) a record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services or employment to you.

If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details set out below.

## INFORMATION SHARING

We keep all your personal data confidential. However, in order to be able to service your needs to the best of our ability, we may share any information you provide to us with our group companies and their agents, counterparties and support service or data providers, wherever located. If you have provided information to other members of our group, those entities may also share that information with us. We will ensure that if we share such information with third parties, any such disclosure is at all times in compliance with Data Protection Legislation.

To help us provide services, your data will be processed internally and externally by other third parties. We use third parties for [administrative, servicing, monitoring and storage of your data]. We will outsource some services to third parties whom we consider capable of performing the required processing activities so that there is no reduction in the service standard provided to you by us.

The recipients or categories of recipients, of your information may be:

  * Any revenue service or tax authority including to HMRC, if obliged to do so under applicable regulations. For Common Reporting Standards and FATCA, we may also have to report your account(s) to the necessary tax authorities.
  * UK and overseas regulators and authorities in connection with their duties (such as crime prevention).
  * Anyone to whom we may transfer our rights and/or obligations;
  * Any other person or organisation after a restructure, sale or acquisition, as long as that person uses your information for the same purposes as it was originally given to us or used by us (or both).
  * Credit reference, identity and address verification organisations who may record and use your information and disclose it to other lenders, financial services organizations and insurers. Your information may be used by those third parties to make assessments in relation to your creditworthiness for debt tracing.
  * Fraud prevention agencies and law enforcement agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money-laundering and to verify your identity if false or inaccurate information is provided by you and fraud is identified. We, fraud prevention agencies and law enforcement agencies may access and use your information for example, when:
  * Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;
  * Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;
  * Recovering debt;
  * Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance.



Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time. If they’re concerned about a possible fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held by them for up to six years.

In the case of transfers by us, we may also transfer your information where the transfer is to a country deemed to provide adequate protection of your information by the European Commission or you have consented to the transfer.

We will normally destroy or erase data after statutory timelines lapse.
