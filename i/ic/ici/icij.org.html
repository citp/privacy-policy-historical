<b class="h1">Privacy Policy </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">The Center 
  for Public Integrity is the sole owner of the information collected on this 
  site.&nbsp; We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways 
  different from what is disclosed in this statement.&nbsp; The Center for Public 
  Integrity collects information from our users at several different points on 
  our website.<br>
  &nbsp;<b><br>
  Order</b><br>
  We request information from the user on our order form.&nbsp; Here a user must 
  provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial 
  information (like credit card number, expiration date).&nbsp; This information is 
  used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.&nbsp; If we have trouble 
  processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the 
  user. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Cookies</span></b><span style="font-family:
Arial;color:black"><br>
  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing 
  information about the user.&nbsp; Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any 
  personally identifiable information while on our site.&nbsp; Once the user closes 
  their browser, the cookie simply terminates.&nbsp; For instance, by setting a 
  cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than 
  once, thereby saving time while on our site.&nbsp; If a user rejects the cookie, 
  they may still use our site.&nbsp; The only drawback to this is that the user will 
  be limited in some areas of our site.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Log Files</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
  We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s 
  movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; IP 
  addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Sharing<br>
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">&nbsp;We use an outside 
  shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill 
  users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or 
  use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Links<br>
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">This web site contains 
  links to other sites. Please be aware that we, The Center for Public 
  Integrity, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; 
  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
  privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
  identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies solely to 
  information collected by this Web site. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Newsletter<br>
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">If a user wishes to 
  subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and 
  email address. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Tell-A-Friend<br>
  </b>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about 
  our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address.&nbsp; The Center for 
  Public Integrity will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting 
  them to visit the site. The Center for Public Integrity stores this 
  information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.&nbsp; The friend 
  may contact The Center for Public Integrity at www.publicintegrity.org to 
  request the removal of this information from the database. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
  <span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">Security<br>
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">
  The Center for Public Integrity takes every precaution to protect our users’ 
  information.&nbsp; When users submit sensitive information via the website, their 
  information is protected both online and off-line.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
  <span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">When our 
  registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as 
  credit card number and/or social security number), that information is 
  encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 
  SSL.&nbsp; While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the 
  bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
  Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when just 
  ‘surfing’.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
  <span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">While we use 
  SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything 
  in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; All of our users’ 
  information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted 
  in our offices.&nbsp; Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
  job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
  granted access to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
  <span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">If you have 
  any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
  webmaster@publicintegrity.org.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
  <span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Special 
  Offers<br>
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Established members will 
  occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a 
  newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option 
  to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and 
  opt-out below. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Choice/Opt-out <br>
  </b>Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their 
  information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point 
  where we ask for the information.&nbsp; For example, our order form has an 
  ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don’t want any 
  marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.&nbsp; </span>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Users who no 
  longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these 
  communications by sending an e-mail to majordomo@lists.publicintegrity.org, in 
  the body of the message enter “unsubscribe public-i”; without the quotes.&nbsp; 
  Once the request has been processed an acknowledgment message will be sent.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">
  Notification of Changes<br>
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">If we decide to change 
  our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users 
  are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
  circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; When we do, we will also revise the 
  “last updated” date at the bottom of the privacy statement.</span></p>
