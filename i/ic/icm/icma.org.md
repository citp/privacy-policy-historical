# Privacy Policy | icma.org

Updated May 21, 2018

Your privacy is important to International City/County Management Association (" ** _ICMA_** ", " ** _we_** ", or " ** _us_** ").  We developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process Personal Data about you, including through [https://ICMA.org](https://icma.org/), [www.lifewellrun.org](http://www.lifewellrun.org/), and any other ICMA websites or applications that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “ ** _Site_** ”).  Visit **[My ICMA](https://members.icma.org/eweb/MemberPage.aspx?Site=icmares&WebCode=MemberPage)** to change your privacy and communication preferences.  If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [CustomerServices@icma.org](mailto:CustomerServices@icma.org).

####  **1.   Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may revise and update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will post the updated Privacy Policy to the Site. If these changes are material ( _i.e._ , changes we believe you will find important), we will provide notice of changes by email or by posting notice of the changes on our Site.

####  **2.   What is Personal Data?**

“ ** _Personal Data_** ” is information that, either alone or in combination with other information, identifies you. When we combine other information ( _i.e._ , information that does not, on its own, identify you) with Personal Data about you, we treat the combined information as Personal Data.

####  **3.   How We Collect and Use Personal Data**

 **A.   Personal Data You Provide to Us **

We collect Personal Data when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we may collect your name, address, email address, demographic information, and payment information, when you complete your online profile, submit a membership application, make a purchase such as a book or conference registration, complete a survey, send an email to us through our “Contact Us” feature, make a donation, or provide information via paper forms or in-person interactions (e.g., making a purchase at an on-site conference).

 ICMA uses contact information to inform you of new products, technical information and services, and upcoming events that may be of interest based on your participation in ICMA, expressed interests, selected industry codes, or industry engagement. After your membership expires, we may continue to send you occasional e-mails to provide you with offers to rejoin ICMA.  If you no longer wish to receive these emails, the opt-out process is described in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy. You may also unsubscribe from these e-mails by following the unsubscribe instructions found within the email.

We process your email and password to enable you to securely log into the Site, and we process information regarding your role with ICMA to appropriately control access to certain content.  We process this Personal Data only as necessary to provide you services on the Site under our and to further our legitimate interests in protecting the Site and content.

ICMA uses the information provided through membership forms to process membership applications and related requests. For example, based on your agreement to become a member, ICMA processes membership in other associations; information on your involvement in ICMA such as offices held, committees served on, etc.; educational background; professional background; and personal and professional references.  We process this information only as necessary to provide you with the benefits of membership.  We also archive membership information for historical purposes.

We allow users to post or provide content via the Site, including questions, comments, blog posts, file uploads, document submission, and wiki contributions, (collectively, “User Postings”) and you may choose to contribute User Postings to our community and on the Site. Because your User Postings are associated with your profile, they may be identifiable to us and to other users.  We are not responsible for any use of the Personal Data that you may include as part of your User Postings.

We also use the Personal Data we collect about you to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.
