Protecting the privacy and safeguarding the personal and financial information 

of our clients and website visitors is one of our highest priorities. The 

following Privacy Statement explains how iTrade Capital Markets ("ICM") collects 

and protects your personal information. References to "ICM" in this Privacy 

Statement include all ICM companies and divisions, including icmtrading.com.<br>

<br>

By opening a ICM account or by using ICM Web sites, you give your consent to the 

collection and use of personal information by ICM as explained in this privacy 

statement.<br>

<br>

Collection of personal information<br>

We collect information required to open an account, to transact business 

effectively and to safeguard your privacy. To do this, we gather information to 

help us assess your needs and preferences.<br>

<br>

The information we collect directly from you includes information required to 

communicate with you, including your name, mailing address, telephone number, 

e-mail address. In addition, we collect information required by law to identify 

who you are, including Passport number. We also collect demographic information 

when you open an account, including birth date, occupation and employment 

status. <br>

<br>

You directly provide to us the majority of information we collect. You do this 

by completing the account application and related documentation, by placing a 

trade, by sending us an e-mail, or by submitting information in response to a 

promotion or special offer. Other ways we obtain information are by (1) 

observing your usage of the Web site, and (2) providing products and services to 

you. This information enables us to offer you products and services that should 

be of interest to you.<br>

<br>

The information we collect indirectly from you includes your Internet protocol 

("IP") address, browser type, operating system, Internet service provider (ISP), 

time stamps, transactions placed, and banner ads you click. We do this through 

the use of cookies, which are small text files sent from the Web server and may 

be stored on your computer. Cookies help us to know you better by providing 

operational data we can use to aid your interaction with our Web site and 

improve its navigation and usability.<br>

<br>

Usage of personal information<br>

ICM may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and 

contact information. We may also use this information to establish and set up 

your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password, maintain 

your account activity, and contact you with account information. This 

information helps us improve our services to you, customize your browsing 

experience and inform you about additional products, services or promotions that 

may be of interest to you.<br>

<br>

Should you close your account with us, ICM will retain your information, but 

only use it to comply with regulatory requirements and to periodically contact 

you to offer you the opportunity to reactivate your account or participate in 

other valuable offers.<br>

<br>

ICM affiliates and partners<br>

ICM may share information with affiliates if the information is required to 

provide the product or service you have requested or to provide you the 

opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. ICM 

also forges partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing 

agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality products and services 

that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these products 

and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and 

relevant, ICM may share some personal information with partners, affiliates and 

alliances. This allows them to better understand the offers that are most 

relevant and useful. In our strategic relationships, we will require that it be 

identified that an offer is being extended because of the relationship with us. 

The use of your personal information is limited to the purposes identified in 

our relationship with the partner or affiliate.<br>

<br>

Non-affiliated third parties<br>

ICM does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal 

information to any third party for any reason, except as described below.<br>

<br>

ICM reserves the right to disclose your personal information to third parties 

where required by law to regulatory, law enforcement or other government 

authorities. We may also disclose your information as necessary to credit 

reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect our rights or 

property.<br>

<br>

To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help 

us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, 

fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys or other data 

collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with 

client information from our database to help us to analyze and identify client 

needs and notify clients of product and service offerings. Use of the 

information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request 

and for no other purpose. All third parties with which we share personal 

information are required to protect personal information in a manner similar to 

the way we protect personal information. Examples of information shared are 

identifying information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address and, 

telephone number, and information on account activity.<br>

<br>

If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another 

company, for example by clicking on an advertisement on a Web site owned or 

controlled by ICM, any personal information you share with that company will no 

longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the 

privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and we have no control of 

the use or protection of information provided by you or collected by those 

sites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded Web site or to a linked Web 

site, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note 

that the information you are providing is going to a third party, and you should 

familiarize yourself with the privacy policy published by that third party.<br>

<br>

Opting out of disclosures of non-public personal information<br>

You may direct us not to disclose non-public personal information to certain 

third parties. To opt out of sharing non-public personal information with third 

parties, please contact ICM as stated in the contact information listed below. 

Note that for joint accounts, an opt out election made by one account owner of a 

Joint account is applicable to all account owners of the Joint account. An 

opt-out election must be made for each separate account you hold at ICM.<br>

<br>

If we propose to share information in a manner not covered in this Privacy 

Statement, we will notify you of this change by posting an addendum on the ICM 

Web site, a notice in the "What's New" section of the Web site, and if 

appropriate, provide you an opportunity to opt out of such use.<br>

<br>

The security of your personal information<br>

We employ security software, systems, and procedures to offer you a safe and 

secure trading environment and protect your personal, financial and trading 

information.<br>

<br>

When you open an account with us, you are issued a unique account number, User 

ID and a password. Only a limited number of ICM employees who have a need to 

know this information will have access to your account number, UserID, and 

password. Remember: you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy 

of your account number, User ID, and password. We strongly recommend that you do 

not disclose this information to any one else.<br>

<br>

ICM may share Web site usage information about visitors to the Web site with 

reputable advertising companies for targeting our Internet banner advertisements 

on this site and other sites. For this purpose, pixel tags (also called clear 

gifs or web beacons) may be used to note the pages you've visited. The 

information collected by the advertising company through the use of these pixel 

tags is not personally identifiable.<br>

<br>

To administer and improve the ICM Web site, we may use a third party to track 

and analyze usage and volume statistical information, including page requests, 

form requests, and click paths. The third party may use cookies to track 

behavior and may set cookies on behalf of ICM. These cookies do not contain any 

personally identifiable information.<br>

<br>

Changes to this Privacy Statement<br>

In the event ICM materially changes this Privacy Statement, the revised Privacy 

Statement will promptly be posted to the Web sites and we will post a notice on 

our Web sites informing you of such changes. You agree to accept posting of a 

revised Privacy Statement electronically on the Web site as actual notice to 

you. Any dispute over our Privacy Statement is subject to this notice and the 

ICM Customer Agreement. If you have any questions that this statement does not 

address, please contact a Client Services representative.<br>
