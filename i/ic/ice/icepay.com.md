Do we need your consent to process Personal Data?
Whilst we always want you to be aware of how we are using your Personal Data, this does not
necessarily mean that we are required to ask for your consent before we can use it. In the day
to day business activities, we may use your Personal Data without asking for your consent, if:
•    processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, or is needed to enter into the
     contract;
•    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject to;

•   If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable
    law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,

Personal Data may be transferred to third countries or international organisations only if there
is an appropriate level of protection and the Customer has given specific consent for this in

perform Processing. In that event, ICEPAY shall notify the Customer of this provision prior to
the Processing, unless that legislation prohibits such notification for serious reasons of general
interest.
Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other
infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service
providers. ICEPAY makes sure that the parties we cooperate with has the same level of privacy
protection as required under the GDPR, and in case of a transfer outside of the EU, we will
rely on corporate rules and contractual protections.
