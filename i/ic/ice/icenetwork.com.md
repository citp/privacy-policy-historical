Some services on our Website require the submission of a credit card number along with personal information in connection with a purchase, other services on our Website require the submission of personal information to the Website. None of these services are available to children under the age of thirteen. If a child who the Providers know to be under the age of thirteen attempts to utilize a service on this Website which is not available to children, he/she will receive a message which states "You are not eligible" for the service.
