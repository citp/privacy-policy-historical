## Information Collected and Stored Automatically

If you visit the ICE Website to read or download information, the following information is collected and stored about your visit:

  * The name of the Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you are connecting from a university's domain) and the IP address from which you access our site; 
  * The type of browser and operating system that is used to access the ICE Website; 
  * The date and time the ICE site is accessed; 
  * The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the ICE Website; and 
  * The pages you visit and the information you request 



This information is primarily collected and used for statistical analysis and technical improvements to the ICE Website. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which may be used for such purposes as assessing what information is of the most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. In certain circumstances, however, ICE may take additional steps to identify you based on this information and ICE may share this information, including your identity, with other agencies.

## If You Send ICE Personal Information

If you choose to provide ICE with personal information, such as sending e-mail or filling out a form and submitting it through the ICE Website, ICE will use that information to respond to your message or to fulfill the requested purpose of communication. Remember that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication is sensitive or includes personal information you may prefer to send it via postal mail instead. 

ICE may share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency. In other limited circumstances, such as responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, ICE may be required by law to disclose information that you submit. Before you submit any personal information, such as an online form, you may be given more specific guidance as to how your personal information may be used. 

Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act, the regulations and records schedules of the National Archives and Records Administration, and in some cases may be covered by the Privacy Act and subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

## Terms of Use of Other Policies

## Linking Policy

The links located within the ICE website are there for the ease of users, however, it should be noted that these links may not adhere to the same privacy policy as stated by ICE. By clicking on one of the links on the ICE website you are leaving the ICE website and subject to a different privacy policy. The ICE agency is not responsible for content found on websites that link to the ICE website. These websites are maintained by both public and private entities of which ICE has no authority. 

ICE maintains its right to add or remove links on the ICE website without previously contacting the site or giving a reason as to why the links are being added or removed. The ICE website does include links to other government and federal websites that may help users better understand policies. ICE will only link to websites that are not federal or government websites if the website is sponsored by a legitimate organization that is affiliated with ICE or other government agencies. ICE will review each link quarterly to ensure the link is accurate and dependable. 

If ICE does link to a website then that website and information posted on that site is under no authority of ICE and ICE has no control over the content placed on that site. If the ICE Website links to another site that is not an endorsement of that site by either ICE or the Department of Homeland Security. That link is there to help the user and provide convenience.

## Public Service

The ICE Website is provided as a public service. Every effort is made to provide complete and accurate information.

ICE will do its best ensure that any errors brought to attention will be corrected as soon as possible. Errors found on the ICE Website can be emailed to the [web master](mailto:ice.publicaffairs@dhs.gov).

## Priorities and Schedule for Posting New Content

Section 207(f)(2) of the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to develop an inventory of information to be published on their Web sites, establish a schedule for publishing information, make those schedules available for public comment, and post the schedules and priorities on the Web site. As a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) this inventory can be found on the main DHS website.

## How to Make a FOIA or Privacy Act Request

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, requires the agency to make its records available to the public to the extent that those records are not otherwise exempt from the disclosure requirements of the Act (e.g., classified national security, business proprietary, personal privacy, and investigative information). 

The Privacy Act (PA), 5 U.S.C. § 552a provides lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens a right of access to records filed in an agency system of records, which are retrieved by their name or personal identifier. 

**ALL REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING**. [FORM G-639](https://web.archive.org/doclib/g-639.pdf) may be used for this purpose. Requests must be for access to existing records. The FOIA /PA Program Office will not "create" records for the purpose of responding to a FOIA or PA request.

Follow these steps to make a request:

  1. The request must be in writing, including a daytime phone number so that we may contact you. 
  2. Provide as much information as possible on the subject matter; this will help expedite the search process.
  3. Verification of Identity, Verification of Guardianship, Accompanying Persons, and Amendment Request are requirements for making a PA request. PA requests should be marked "Privacy Act Request."
  4. Mail your request to: 

> FOIA/PA Section  
>  Information Disclosure Unit   
>  Mission Support Division  
>  Office of Investigations  
>  U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement  
>  425 I Street, NW - Room 4038  
>  Washington, D.C. 20536 

  5. Requests can also be faxed to (202) 616-7612.
  6. Requests are deemed to constitute an agreement to pay any applicable fees that may be chargeable up to $25 without notice. Most requests do not require any fees; however, if fees exceed $25, we will notify you beforehand. 



An "[AFFIRMATION/DECLARATION](https://web.archive.org/doclib/affirmation_declaration.pdf)" form indicating your name, date of birth, name of the person you want your records disclosed to (where applicable) and their address and a statement indicating that **you understand that knowingly or willingly seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses and or without their consent is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000**. 

## Multi-Track Processing:

FOIA requests are placed on one of three (3) tracks. Requests are entered into tracks based upon the complexity of the request:

Track 1: Track one is for those requests which seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA.

Track 2: Track two is for those requests which do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with entities.

Track 3: Track three is for those requests which involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests which may involve sensitive records.
