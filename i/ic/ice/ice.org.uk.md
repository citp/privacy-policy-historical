## Privacy policy

Any personal information collected on ICE websites is protected under the eight data protection principles outlined in the Data Protection Act 1998. These principles protect the reasonable and lawful use of personal data without infringing user privacy.

Data we hold will be used confidentially, and to help us run our services and keep you informed - for example, to collect subscriptions, mail out publications and let you know about conferences and events. Members' names and grade of membership are published on the on-line Members’ Directory.

We may also share relevant data to third parties, but only those that been carefully screened, and can offer members and customers useful information and services. The revenue we receive from third parties helps us improve and enhance our services. Members' data will also be shared with the [ICE Benevolent Fund](http://www.icebenfund.com/).

Overseas members may have their data transferred to international country representatives, to help them administer local events in their home country. We may also use relevant information to target and promote journals, training, and recruitment services.

If you don't want to receive such information, please let our data protection officer know, in writing, or at the email address provided below.

Please note - some employers don't want our recruitment information to be sent to work email addresses. For that reason, you may wish to change your default email address to a home or private email address. Please check your employer's email policy.
