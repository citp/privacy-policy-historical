<h3><a name="how"></a>How Personal Information Is Collected and Used</h3>
<p>Information is collected in two ways: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us </li>
    <li>Information Collected Automatically </li>
</ol>
<h5><a name="voluntarily"></a>1. INFORMATION YOU VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE TO US </h5>
<p>We directly collect Personal Information from you when you submit an online form through our website or send an email to us requesting information or assistance, such as through the submission of a contact form, signing up for a mailing list, registering for an event, downloading a white paper, participating in the employee recruitment process, or by creating an <a href="/contact-us/partner-with-icf">online partner</a> or <a href="/myicf">myICF</a> profile. This Personal Information may be used to customize your view of the website in a registration-based area or to tailor information you receive from ICF. </p>
<p>We also collect Personal Information when you choose to participate in a forum, such as submitting a comment on a blog. Please note that when you voluntarily make your Personal Information available for viewing by third parties online, such as on a blog or public message board, your information can be viewed, collected, and used by individuals and companies outside of ICF International. ICF International is not responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information that is provided in a public forum.</p>
<p>ICF International may also collect and store Personal Information about your website usage when you voluntarily follow a link from an ICF email to a feature on our website. If we collect Personal Information from you at any other time on our site, we will state that Personal Information is being collected at that time and it is always a voluntary submission. Due to the open nature of the Internet, ICF International requests that no unsolicited proprietary or other confidential information be sent to us through our websites.</p>
<p>Persons who supply their email addresses or any other personal contact information online may receive direct mail, email, or telephone contact from us. ICF International may also contact you via surveys to conduct research. If you decline to supply certain information while using the website, you may not be able to access certain content or participate in some features. ICF International regards its databases, which may include your Personal Information, as a valuable asset. Should ICF International sell or transfer any of its business assets, this may include the sale or transfer of such databases of Personal Information to third parties. Personal Information is used only by ICF International and its subsidiaries, business partners, agents, subcontractors, or third-party vendors for purposes consistent with this Website Privacy Policy. In using ICF's websites, you consent to such use of your Personal Information.</p>
<h6><a name="third"></a>ICF's Contracted Third-Party Websites</h6>
<p>ICF International contracts with a number of third-party vendors to enhance your experience on ICFi.com and provide special features, such as online payment processing, online job applications, and investor materials. All such third-party vendors are prohibited from using your Personal Information except to provide these services to ICF, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In addition, these third-party vendors are subject to contractual prohibitions on selling or sharing any Personal Information. The&nbsp;<a href="http://investor.icfi.com" target="_blank">Investor section</a> is hosted by Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters' Terms of Use for Interactive Data can be accessed here: <a href="http://www.interactivedata.com/index.php/Contents/show/content/quoteTerms" shape="rect" target="_blank">http://www.interactivedata.com/index.php/Contents/show/content/quoteTerms</a>. The Career Opportunities section (or Career Center) is hosted by Taleo at <a href="/careers/apply-now">https://jobs.icfi.com</a>. Taleo's Privacy Policy can be accessed here: <a href="http://www.taleo.com/privacy/privacy-policy" target="_blank">http://www.taleo.com/privacy/privacy-policy</a>. Also see <a href="#auto">"2. Information Collected Automatically"</a> below for information on how these third-party sites may be using cookies.</p>
<h6><a name="jobdata"></a>Job Applicant Data</h6>
<p>When you apply to work at ICF International through our online Career Center at <a href="/careers/apply-now">https://jobs.icfi.com</a>, a third-party website (see "ICF's Contracted Third-Party Websites" above), we use your Personal Information to process the application and to monitor recruiting statistics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we disclose information to a third party, for example, to check a reference or obtain a background check, we will inform you beforehand and receive written consent. Personal Information about unsuccessful candidates will be kept on file by Human Resources for future consideration unless you request its removal. We also retain non-personally identifiable statistical information about applicants. Personal Information about unsuccessful candidates/applicants will be held for 12 months following submission in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil, and for 6 months in Europe and Asia.</p>
<h5><a name="auto"></a>2. INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY </h5>
<p>Information regarding your website experience is collected indirectly through the use of "cookies," a technology common to most websites. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to speed up performance of the website and tailor its contents. When you enter a URL or perform a search, or as you navigate through the site, your browser requests data from the website server. </p>
<p>The server automatically logs certain non-personally identifiable information, such as time, date, browser type, domain name, IP address, and referring website URLs. This information is used by ICF International for the operation of our websites, to maintain quality and usefulness of the sites, and to provide general statistics regarding use of ICF websites. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. </p>
<p>ICF International studies this non-personally identifiable data in our Internet access logs at both an aggregate and individual level to help us tailor content toward your interests and needs. For instance, to determine the usefulness of a particular website feature, we may analyze collective traffic to a portion of our site. This collective data contains no Personal Information and is used to help us operate and enhance our site and services. </p>
<p>ICF International also uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the website, for example, by remembering you and your preferences so you don’t have to give the same information again during your session or on subsequent visits to the site, such as a username/password or data for a registration form. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can learn more about cookies at <a href="http://allaboutcookies.org/" shape="rect" target="_blank">allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience fully the ICF websites or other websites you visit. </p>
<p>The list below shows the cookies that are set by ICF websites and the purposes for which such cookies are used. Some of our business partners, such as Taleo and Thomson Reuters, also use cookies when you interact with sections of the ICF International website that are hosted by these third-party vendors. We have no access to or control over these cookies. If you have any queries about these cookies or would like more information about them, please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>
<a name="cookies"></a>
<h6>Cookies Used on This Site </h6>
<p>Cookies are used for a variety of reasons, as outlined below. Some are "necessary" because they are required to make the website perform properly. Other cookies are "functional" and are used to improve the way the website functions for you. The majority of our cookies are "first-party," meaning that they are set by the same website where they are read. Third-party cookies are set and read by contracted vendors that provide services to ICF, such as web analytics or online advertising. Currently you cannot opt out of cookie tracking; ICF websites do not respond to “Do Not Track” preferences in your browser at this time.</p>
