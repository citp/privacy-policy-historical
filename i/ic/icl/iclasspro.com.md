We periodically review our collection, storage and processing procedures and policies to ensure that it is in compliance with applicable law.

**Information We Share With Third Parties**

Except as described in this policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties without your consent. For personal information received by iClassPro under the Privacy Shield and disclosed to a third party, iClassPro remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third party engages with the personal data in a manner inconsistent with the principles of the Privacy Shield, unless iClassPro proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We will only share your personal information with the following types of third parties for the following purposes:

  * Fulfilling services.  We share personal information with the relevant third parties related to providing the products or services you have purchased or subscribed to, which include without limitation, partners and subcontractors that are utilized for the purpose of operating the Website or fulfilling the products or services requested by you, and the facility that is associated with the iClassPro Parent Portal main account.

Additionally, be aware that we may be required to disclose an individual's personal information in response to a valid legal requirement, such as in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, search warrant, subpoena, court order; or in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property, or assert legal rights or defend ourselves in litigation.  If iClassPro is legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.

**TRANSFER OF DATA UPON SALE OR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OF ICLASSPRO**

In the event that the Website (or a substantial portion of our assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets and may be part of those assets that are transferred.

**How We Secure Information Transmissions**  
When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Website, a secure server software which we have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Website.

Other emails that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.

**How Do We Protect Your Information**

_Information Security_.  
We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction of personal information.

_Evaluation of Information Protection Practices_.  
Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality, and quality of our information.

_Employee Access, Training, and Expectations_.  
Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies, and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes, and transactions.

**HOW YOU CAN Access and Control YOUR Personal Data**

_Individual Rights to Access Personal Data_

Individuals have the right to know what personal data of theirs is stored by iClassPro and to ensure that such personal data is accurate and relevant for the purposes for which iClassPro collected it. iClassPro will make its best effort to allow individuals access to view their own data as well as to correct, to alter or to delete such data.

However, where such access is unreasonable, requires a disproportionate effort, jeopardizes the privacy of other iClassPro users, or contravenes the law, our policies, or reasonable business practice, requests to access data may be declined. User identification is required to access data for these reasons, and the process and procedures for various types of access may differ. Please contact us for further information.

_Choices Relating to Use of Personal Information_

We'll give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal information, and we'll respect the choices you make. Although signing up for some or all of our services may require you to submit personal information, we will ask for your consent if we intend to use that information for any purpose other than which it was provided to us.  You may object, restrict or withdraw consent for us to use your personal information at any time.

In the case of us wishing to use your private information for any purpose different than the purpose it was provided and set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will request your consent to use your personal information and will only use it if you affirmatively give us consent to do so through an opt in process.

You may choose to decline to submit any personal information for any of our products or services. Please note that this may result in our being unable to provide said service, including, without limitation, subscription services, even if time remains for your subscription. 

**California Privacy Rights**

Under Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information from companies with whom they have an established business relationship.  That information is about the personal information those companies have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.  The law requires companies to inform consumers about the categories of personally information shared with third parties, the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the services or products marketed by those third parties.  To request a copy of the information disclosure provided by iClassPro under Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, please contact us.

**Children’s Privacy Protection  **

iClassPro takes special care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 and iClassPro encourages parents to be an active participant in their child’s online activities.  iClassPro abides by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant laws.  The website does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13, and iClassPro will not knowingly collect personal information from them.  If iClassPro discovers personal data from a child gathered through the website, without parental consent, iClassPro will eliminate that data.  This website is not intended for persons under the age of 13.  If you are under 13 you must ask a parent or legal guardian for permission prior to submitting any information to this website.

**Do Not Track Notice   **

Your browser may provide you with the option to send a “Do Not Track” signal to websites you visit.  This signal is used to request that websites not send the requesting device cookies, but websites have no obligation to respond to such signal or to modify their operation.  At the current time, this website is not programmed to recognize Do Not Track signals, so this website will not treat you differently if we receive such signals from your browser and we may not comply with Do Not Track settings on your browser.

**  Third-Party Sites linked to the Website**  
We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Website nor the information or content contained therein.

**Data Portability**

If required by applicable law, iClassPro will comply with your request to obtain a copy of the information you have shared through our services.  If provided for by applicable law, you have rights to obtain a copy of some of the personal information that we hold on you and reuse or share it for your own purposes (“right to data portability”).

The above-stated right to data portability only applies:

  * to personal information you have provided to us (i.e. not any other information);
  * where we are processing your personal information because you have provided your consent for us to do so, or under a contract with you; and
  * when processing is carried out by automated means.



‍We can refuse your data portability request if the processing does not satisfy the above criteria.  Also, if the personal information concerns more than one individual, we may not be able to transfer the information to you if doing so would prejudice the other person’s rights.
