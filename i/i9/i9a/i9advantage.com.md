# Privacy Policy

[](http://export.gov/safeharbor/ "Safe Harbor Privacy Policy")

i9advantage.com respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, business partners, and others who may use our services.  Not only does i9advantage.com strive to collect, use, and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business, but we also pride ourselves in upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices.  This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) sets forth the privacy principles that i9advantage.com follows with respect to personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States. ****

**SAFE HARBOR**

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the “Safe Harbor Principles”) to enable U.S. Companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States.  Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, i9advantage.com adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.
