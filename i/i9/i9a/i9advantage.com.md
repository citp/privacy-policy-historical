# Privacy Policy

i9advantage.com respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, business partners, and others who may use our services.  Not only does i9advantage.com strive to collect, use, and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business, but we also pride ourselves in upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices.  This Data Security Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) sets forth the privacy principles that i9advantage.com follows with respect to personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States.

**PRIVACY SHIELD**

The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework was designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and European Commission to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission deemed the Privacy Shield Framework adequate to enable data transfers under EU law (see the [adequacy determination](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/eu-us-privacy-shield/index_en.htm)).

The Privacy Shield program, which is administered by the International Trade Administration (ITA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce, enables U.S.-based organizations to join the Privacy Shield Framework and benefit from the adequacy determination.  Upon voluntarily joining the Privacy Shield Framework, and publicly committing to comply with the Framework’s requirements, the commitment becomes enforceable under U.S. law. Consistent with its commitment to protecting personal privacy, i9advantage.com adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.

i9advantage.com complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  i9advantage.com has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>
