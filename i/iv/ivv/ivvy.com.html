	<h1>iVvy Privacy Policy</h1>
	<div class="content"><p>iVvy ("iVvy" "us" or "we") manage Personal Information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act") and the Australian Privacy Principles ("APP") contained therein. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of Personal Information that we may collect, how that Personal Information will be collected, used, disclosed, transferred and stored and sets out the measures that we take to comply with the Privacy Act.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
<p>By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to us collecting, using, storing and disclosing that information (within and outside Australia) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p>In our Privacy Policy:</p>
<p><strong>Associated Third Parties</strong> means individuals, companies and other entities with whom we work to provide products and Services (for example, companies offering products related to our services or other service providers).</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong> has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong> means this document as amended from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>Related Entities</strong> has the same meaning as under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong> means the services we provide in our business from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>Social Networking Sites</strong> means any social networking sites operated or utilised by us.</p>
<p>The meaning of any general language is not restricted by any accompanying example and the words 'includes', 'including', 'such as', 'for example' or similar words are not words of limitation.</p>
<h3><strong>Collection</strong></h3>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">When you interact with iVvy through the Services we provide, we may collect Personal Information from you, that is necessary for us to undertake our business and perform our functions and activities.&nbsp; If we do not do so or if the information is incomplete or inaccurate, we may not be able to undertake our business or the standard and quality of our business may be compromised. Although not an exhaustive list, the Personal Information we collect may include:</span></p>
<p><strong>Event Organisers &amp; Suppliers (Clients)</strong></p>

The Personal Information we may collect includes without limitation your name, email address, telephone numbers, address and other personally identifiable information. In some cases we may collect your credit card information to allow you to pay for the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Event Attendees</strong></p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be collected by iVvy if you voluntarily register for an event through an Event Organiser's account or if you request a booking or a proposal for a service through the iVvy systems, or your data is uploaded into the system by one of our Event Organisers. This Personal Information may include your name, email address, phone number, address, bank and credit card details (including expiry dates) if required for payments and other personally identifiable information. Event Organisers can also create event registration websites to collect virtually any information from you. If an Event Attendee voluntarily provides that information in connection with registration for an event or otherwise, it will be available to iVvy and will be held by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you access another website from our websites, you may be transferring to another country or to a website over which we have no control and take no responsibility.&nbsp; If you provide Personal Information using another website, you do so subject to the privacy laws (if any) in that jurisdiction and any privacy policy on that website.</p>
<p>While we have privacy rules in place to protect your Personal Information, the overseas recipient may not be subject to privacy obligations or to any principles similar to the Australian Privacy Principles.&nbsp; The overseas recipient may also be subject to a foreign law which could compel disclosure of Personal Information to a third party, for example, an overseas authority.</p>
<p>If you consent to the disclosure and the overseas recipient handles the information in breach of the Australian Privacy Principles, you will not be able to seek redress under the Privacy Act, may not be able to seek redress in the overseas jurisdiction and we will not be accountable under the Privacy Act.</p>

<h3>Integrity and access</h3>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Security</span></strong></p>
<p>iVvy will endeavour to protect the confidentiality of its client's information, account information and personal communications to the fullest extent possible and consistent with the law and the legitimate interests of iVvy, its partners, its resellers, its employees and other clients of iVvy. To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from clients, iVvy has physical, electronic, and managerial security procedures in place.</p>
<p><strong>Considerations when you send information to us electronically</strong></p>
<p>While we do all we reasonably can to protect your Personal Information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, including investing in security software, no data transfer over the internet is 100% secure. The open nature of the internet is such that information exchanged via the internet may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. If you send us any information, including (without limitation) Personal Information, it is sent at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you access another website from our websites, you do so and provide Personal Information in accordance with the terms and conditions under which the provider of that website operates.</p>
<p><strong>Modification of client information</strong></p>
<p>You may request access to your Personal Information or correct any inaccurate or out of date information (including unsubscribing from any mail lists) by contacting our Privacy Officer using the details below or by updating your information by logging into the iVvy software (https://www.ivvy.com/a/[youraccountname]).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may request the source of any information we collect from a third party.&nbsp; We will provide this at no cost, unless under the Privacy Act or other law there is a reason for this information being withheld.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a reason under the Privacy Act or other law for us not to provide you with information, we will give you a written notice of refusal setting out the reasons for the refusal (except to the extent it would be unreasonable or unlawful to do so) and advise you of the mechanisms available to you to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Deletion</strong></p>
<p>iVvy may retain your Client Information as long as you continue to use the Services. It may also be necessary for us to retain your Personal Information to comply with applicable law, guidelines, codes or regulatory requirements. You may close your account by contacting us. Even if we delete your Information it may persist on backup or archival media and other information systems.</p>
<p><strong>Third party websites</strong></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices or the content of any third party websites accessed from our websites and we make no representations or warranties in respect of those websites.&nbsp; You must therefore read the third party's privacy policy and satisfy yourself as to the content and appropriateness of that policy.</p>
<p><strong>How we modify this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>iVvy may from time to time update its privacy policy by posting an amended privacy policy that is always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on iVvy's homepage.</p>
<p>You should check the Privacy Policy through this link periodically (including on each occasion you provide us with Personal Information) for modifications by clicking on the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of material modifications and their effective dates.</p>
<p>If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with a complaint</strong></p>
<p>If you make a complaint about a privacy matter, our Privacy Officer will respond as soon as possible (but within 14 days) and advise you who in our company will have responsibility for investigating and managing your complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will try to resolve your complaint within 30 days of receiving it.&nbsp; If this is not possible, we will contact you and provide you with an estimate of the time it will take to investigate and manage the complaint.</p>
<h3><strong>Contact information</strong></h3>
