## How we protect your information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect User’s personal information, username, password, transactions information and data stored on our Site against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. Security of your personal identification information is of utmost concern to us. User’s ivipid videos and other content are limited-access where access is gained through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess the URL address of User’s video or content without an invitation from this User including the relevant URL. However, because videos and content are not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover User’s videos and/or content.

## Sharing your personal information

We do not sell, trade, or rent User’s personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information irrelevant to any personal identification information of Site’s visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes mentioned above. We may use third party service providers to help us to operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share User’s information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that a User has given us his permission.

## Accessing Web Account Information

A User must update his personal identification information promptly after it changes. A User may change this information by sending us an e-mail. A User may ask to have the information in his account to be deleted or removed at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to delete User’s information however, because we and our web hosting company have backup systems and keep track of past transactions and/or activities, it may be impossible to completely delete User’s information.

## Electronic newsletters
