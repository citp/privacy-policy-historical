# Privacy Policy | Ivideon

_Last updated: June 9, 2016_

MOBILE VIDEO SOLUTIONS INC (IVIDEON) is pleased to provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information we receive from you and other users of the IVIDEON service, through our software, mobile applications and our website located at [http://www.ivideon.com](http://www.ivideon.com/) (the Website). Such service, the software, mobile applications and the Website are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the Service. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service. By using the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. IVIDEON reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website at <http://www.ivideon.com/privacy>. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Service will be subject to the then-current privacy policy.

## Information We Collect

The data that we regularly collect about visitors to the Website (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not necessarily enable us to personally identify you, and that is not our intention.

We do collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, credit card and/or bank account information, business name and address or other information that allows us to identify you or that could reasonably be used to infer your identity, when you voluntarily provide it by registering with us or using the Service. For analytical and marketing purposes, and to prevent fraud, we also collect data related to your account, such as your IP-address and ISP name, referral links, client software configuration, and payments history with third party services. Once you become a user, you may provide additional information, such as your location, to allow us to provide location-based feature. Providing additional information is optional.

To facilitate your use of the Service, IVIDEON may automatically collect certain types of information listed above when you access or use the Service. In order to collect this data, IVIDEON may utilize automated tools and files such as cookies. These automated tools and files may reside on our servers or on your computer or device. If you restrict our ability to use automated tools and files, your ability to access and use all or part of the Service may be limited or disabled completely.

## Use of Information

IVIDEON uses your personally identifiable information primarily for the following purposes: (i) to provide, test and improve our Service, features and content, (ii) to administer the Service, including to verify your authority to access the Service, (iii) to provide customer support for the Service, (iv) to fulfill requests you may make, (v) to personalize your experience, (vi) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements, and (vii) to provide you with further information from us related to the services that we believe you may find useful or interesting.

You may opt-out of receiving some or all non-Service related communications by updating your profile on the Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive any such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications sent to you, or update your profile information.

We use information we obtain by technical means (such as the automatic recording performed by our servers or through the use of cookies) for the above purposes and in order to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to your needs, to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and website use behavior of our users, and to verify that users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.

## Controlling Your Personal Information

IVIDEON may make available to users chat rooms, forums, message boards, and other interactive features. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) via forums, postings, profiles or other areas of the Website, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of IVIDEON. Please do not post any personal information on the Website or in other areas that you expect to keep private.

## Disclosure

IVIDEON does not share your personal information with third parties or the public except as set forth herein.

Third Parties. We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers, such as data storage providers, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, and payment processing, which supplement and improve the Service. These service providers may have access to personal information as needed to perform their functions and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from disclosing your personal information, except for the purpose of providing the services in question. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.

Research. We may use and disclose to third parties information we collect in aggregated, non-personally identifiable form for research and informational purposes and to help us make sales, marketing and business decisions.

Mergers & Acquisitions. IVIDEON may disclose your personally identifiable information, as necessary, in connection with a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of IVIDEON stock or assets in IVIDEON line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization. We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to any new privacy policy of an acquirer of our business.

Special Circumstances. In addition, IVIDEON may disclose your personally identifiable information (a) when requested to do so by law enforcement agencies; (b) when obliged to do so under applicable law; (c) to protect the property rights of IVIDEON or a third party; (d) to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity that IVIDEON may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable, or (e) when given permission to do so by you.
