(“IvyConnect” or “we,” “us” or “our”) knows that You, our user (“You”) care about how information regarding You is used and shared, and we appreciate Your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly when You share information via www.ivyconnect.com, www.ivydate.com, www.ivygive.com, www.ivycard.com and www.ivysocial.com including all extensions of such URLs, subdomains and mobile versions thereof (the “Websites”).

If You have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), please contact us via the following link www.ivyconnect.com/contact.

## 2\. Information We Collect.

We collect information about You and Your use of the Websites. We may collect personally identifiable information such as Your name, address, age, picture, phone number, email address, demographic and biographical information as well as other information that does not personally identify You. We use this information to share Your profile information with other users of the Websites and to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior to better understand and serve You and our community. The following sections describe how we collect information:

(a) Registration.

When You register or subscribe to any of the services and features available on our Websites (the “Services”), You provide information to us and we collect a wide variety of information about You. Such information includes personally identifiable information such as Your name, address, age, picture, email address, phone number, demographic and biographical information and other profile information.

(b) Log Files.

Like many web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Websites traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Websites, to track users’ movements around the Websites and to gather demographic information about our user base. 

We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, as discussed below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Websites in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics to improve our Services to our users. 

(c) Cookies.

We use cookies to keep track of some types of information while You are visiting our Websites or using our Services. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We may also use cookies to automatically collect information about Your online activity on our Websites, for example, which web pages You browsed, which links You clicked on, which profiles You visited, or which searches You conducted on our Websites. While most browsers automatically accept cookies, You can usually modify Your browser setting to decline cookies. If You choose to decline cookies, please note that this may affect Your access to some features of our Websites and may make it more difficult for You to sign in. If You choose to decline our cookies, You assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality or access. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Websites only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Some of our business partners, including advertisers, use cookies on our Websites. We have no access to or control over such cookies. Please refer to Section 7(b) below for further information regarding third-party advertisers. 

(d) Web Beacons (Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags).

We employ and our third party advertising partner may employ a software technology called web beacons, also referred to as clear GIFs or pixel tags, that help manage content on the Websites by tracking what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users in order to further personalize our Websites for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We also may include web beacons in advertisements or promotional or other e-mail messages or to determine whether messages have been opened or acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If You would like to opt-out of such emails, please refer to Section 8 below for further information regarding opting out. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable information. Please refer to Section 7(b) below for further information regarding third-party advertisers.

(e) Purchase Information.

To process purchases, we may require personally identifiable information such as Your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Such information is used primarily to process Your order or as otherwise described herein. 

(f) Surveys or Contests.

We may provide You with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Websites. If You participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from You. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information. We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Websites traffic, or to personalize the Websites (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys).

(g) Information Regarding Your Friends.

We encourage You to refer a friend to our Websites by sending us a friend’s name and email address. We will collect and keep any such information about a friend. We will invite that person with a one-time e-mail with Your name, and a one-time reminder. You agree to use this feature only for friends who You believe are interested in our Services, and You agree not to abuse this feature. 

(h) Public Forums.

We may make discussion boards, forums and chat rooms available to You. You participate in these areas with the acknowledgement that any information You disclose becomes public information, including any personally identifiable information. Please review the guidelines for any of these areas when posting comments for terms and conditions and other specific information.
