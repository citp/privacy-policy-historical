**Personal Data  
** We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address ("personal data") through our site unless you have provided it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal data collected, please do not submit it to us.

When you do provide us with personal data, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may process that information in order to fulfill an order or request you have placed with us; we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; we (or a fulfillment house or other third party on our behalf in connection with a promotion) may use that information to contact you; and/or we may provide other third parties with aggregate - but not individual - information about visitors to or users of our site. We will not sell, rent, or market personal data about you to third parties.
