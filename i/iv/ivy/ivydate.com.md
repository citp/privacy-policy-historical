# IvyDate: Privacy

**IvyDate, Inc.**

### Overview

IvyDate, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly when you share information via IvyDate.com (the “Site”).

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact us at the following link [www.ivydate.com/contact](http://www.ivydate.com/contact).

## Information We Collect

We collect information about you and your use of the Site.  We may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, age, picture, phone number, email address, demographic and biographical information as well as other information that does not personally identify you.  We use this information to share your profile information with other users of the Site and to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. The following sections describe how we collect information:

### _Registration_

When you register or subscribe to any of our services, you provide information to us and we collect a wide variety of information about you.  Such information includes personally identifiable information such as your name, address, age, picture, email address, phone number, demographic and biographical information and other profile information.

### _Log Files_

Like many web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base. 

We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, as discussed below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate.  This service captures usage and volume statistics to improve our services to our users. 

### _Cookies_

We use cookies to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our Site or using our services.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your online activity on our Site, for example, which web pages you browsed, which links you clicked on, which profiles you visited, or which searches you conducted on our Site.  While most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.  If you choose to decline cookies, please note that this may affect your access to some features of our Site and may make it more difficult for you to sign in.  If you choose to decline our cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality or access. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.  See “Third Party Advertisers.”

### _Web Beacons (Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags)_

We employ and our third party advertising partner may employ a software technology called web beacons, also referred to as clear GIFs or pixel tags, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective.  Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users in order to further personalize our Site for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We also may include web beacons in advertisements or promotional or other e-mail messages or to determine whether messages have been opened or acted upon.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice/Opt-out.”  We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

To learn more about our advertising partners’ use of web beacons, see “Third Party Advertisers.” 

### _Purchase Information_

To process purchases, we may require personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information.  Such information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. 

### _Surveys or Contests_

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information.  We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic, or to personalize the Site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys).

### _Information Regarding Your Friends_

We encourage you to refer a friend to our Site by sending us a friend’s name and email address.  We will collect and keep any such information about a friend.  We will invite that person with a one-time e-mail with your name, and a one-time reminder. You agree to use this feature for only friends who you believe are interested in our services, and you agree not to abuse this feature. 

### _Public Forums_

We may make discussion boards, forums and chat rooms available to you.  You participate in these areas with the acknowledgement that any information you disclose becomes public information, including any personally identifiable information.  Please review the guidelines for any of these areas when posting comments for terms and conditions and other specific information.

## How We Use Your Information

In general, we may use information that we collect about you to: (i) share information with other users of the Site; (ii) deliver the products and services that you have requested; (iii) conduct research and analysis about your activities on our Site, including your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or those offered by third parties; (iv) provide customer support and manage your account; (v) provide you information via e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services offered by us or third parties; (vi) monitor surveys, discussion boards, forums and/or chat rooms provided to you on our Site from us or a third party; (vii) verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests; (viii) develop and provide content and advertising customized to your interests from us or third parties; (ix) contact your friends for whom you have provided us a name and an email address; (x) enforce this Privacy Policy, the Registration Agreement and other applicable terms and conditions; (xi) manage our business; and (xii) perform functions and activities as otherwise described to you at the time of collection of information.

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, web beacons, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences.  We may tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Site for you.

We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested.  To enrich our Profiles of individual customers, we may tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.  We may share your profile with third parties for promotional purposes, but will not share such profiles in any way that would identify you.

## Conditions Under Which We Share Information

We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.
