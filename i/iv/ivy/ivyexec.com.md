We use other third parties to provide Web analytics on the Websites. When you sign up for the Websites, we will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

### Internet Protocol Address

Like most Websites, we collect Internet Protocol ("IP") address from all visitors to the Websites. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Websites, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Websites, and deliver customized, personalized content.

### Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Tools

When you access the Websites, we may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your browser, which we use to help provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. We may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Websites, and to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests. In addition, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) and similar tools, which are used to track usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use these tools in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

### EU Privacy Rights

If you are in the European Union (EU), the General Data Protection Regulation grants you certain rights under the law. In particular, the right to access, correct, or delete the personal data Ivy Exec holds about you. Ivy Exec will retain your data for the length of time you engage with our services until you request deletion of such personal data.

Upon request, Ivy Exec will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. In addition, Ivy Exec will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information it holds about them. Ivy Exec also relies upon each individual to assist in providing accurate updates of his or her personal data. In order to access, correct, amend, or delete the personal data Ivy Exec holds about an individual, the individual should contact.

If you have a comment, question, or complaint about how Ivy Exec is handling your personal data, we hope that you contact us in order to allow us to resolve the matter. In addition, individuals located in the EU may submit a complaint regarding the processing of their personal data to the EU data protection authorities (DPAs).

### Other Websites

Ivy Exec contains links to other Websites over which we have no control and bear no responsibility.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. 

### Third Party Advertisers

We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Websites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Websites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to them, and we cannot control their activities.

### Security

The security of your personal data is important to us. We have implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal data. We also protect account information by placing it in a secure database that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Ivy Exec. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal data, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal data.

### Legal Disclaimer

We may disclose your Personal data when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us. As such, we cannot ensure that your Personal data will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
