In addition, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) and similar tools, which are used to track usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use these tools in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

### Third Party Advertisers

We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Web sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Web sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
