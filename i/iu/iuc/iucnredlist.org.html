<ul>
	<li>When you register on The IUCN Red List website for an account, we ask you to provide information such as your email, your name, and sometimes your institution and country.</li>
	<li>When you provide information through the feedback form, we ask you for your email and name.</li>
	<li>When you wish to donate to The IUCN Red List, we ask you to provide information relating to that payment, and this is dealt with by a secure third-party site.</li>
	<li>When you want to use the Red List API, we ask for your email, name, and institution.</li>
	<li>When you visit the Red List website, we may collect information about your online browsing behaviour and any devices you have used to access the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="article__header--h2"><a id="How we collect and use personal information" name="How we collect and use personal information">How and why we collect and use your personal information</a></h2>

<p class="article__text"><strong>1. Registering as a user</strong></p>

<p class="article__text">The personal information provided when registering as a user gives us a better profile of our user community and some idea of how The IUCN Red List data are being used. We need your email so that when a data export is completed, we can contact you and let you know.</p>

<p class="article__text"><strong>2. Feedback form</strong></p>

<p class="article__text">We need your email on the feedback form so that we can reply to you if needed.</p>

<p class="article__text">If you provide us with your institution information, it helps us understand the different types of users of the Red List, and subsequently to better improve how we serve our users.</p>

<p class="article__text"><strong>3. Donating to The IUCN Red List</strong></p>

<p class="article__text">When you make a donation to The IUCN Red List, we collect information about you to enable the donation to happen, and also your email so we can contact you to let you know about the transaction status. The payment is handled securely by a third-party. If you want to know more about the third-party, please contact us, as per <a href="#How to contact us"><span style="color:#0f456f;">below</span></a>.</p>

<p class="article__text">After a transaction, your personal details will not be stored on our servers.</p>

<p class="article__text"><strong>4. The Red List API</strong></p>

<p class="article__text">We need your personal information including email and institution, when you request a token for using our API, so we can reply to you if your request is accepted, and also to determine if your request is a valid one and is in accordance with the <a href="/terms/terms-of-use" target="_self"><span style="color:#0f456f;">Terms of Use</span></a> of The IUCN Red List. We may occasionally contact you to ask you to let us know how you are using the Red List data, as we are always interested to see how the data are being used.</p>

<p class="article__text"><strong>5. Analytics for The IUCN Red List website</strong></p>

<p class="article__text">We use Google Analytics to track how our website is being used. It enables us to get an idea of usage of the Red List website, and where our users come from and how the website is being used. This is important for us so that we can make appropriate changes to the website to better suit our users. We may share this information with the <a href="/about/partners" target="_self"><span style="color:#0f456f;">Red List Partners</span></a>.</p>

<p class="article__text">You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by following the guidance provided by Google <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_self"><span style="color:#0f456f;">here</span></a>.</p>

<h2 class="article__header--h2"><br>
<a id="Why do we process your personal information" name="Why do we process your personal information">Why we process your personal information</a></h2>

<p>We will only collect and use your personal information (as per the sections above), in accordance with data protection laws - and as such, our grounds for processing your personal information are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Consent</strong> - where necessary, we will only collect information and process that information if you have consented for us to do so. For example, we may have newsletters that you decide to subscribe to.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Legitimate interests </strong>- we may use and process some of your personal information where we have sensible and legitimate grounds for doing so. Under European privacy laws there is a concept of "legitimate interests" as a justification for processing your personal information. Our legitimate interests for processing your personal information are:

	<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<li>To enable you to access a section of the website i.e. saved searches and downloads.</li>
		<li>To communicate with you, when certain actions you initiated have reached a certain stage.</li>
		<li>To improve the website - we maybe use your usage information to make the website better.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="article__header--h2">&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="article__text">You have the right to object to our use of your personal information (according to the new <a href="http://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_self"><span style="color:#0f456f;">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations</span></a>) for these legitimate interests, including a right to object to profiling.</p>
