## Use of data

The personal information provided when registering as a User gives us a better profile of our user community and some idea of how the Red List data are being used. The Feedback form enables us to correct and improve the information presented. We may use your personal data to contact you about any feedback you have provided, or to follow-up on particular data exports you may have requested.
