<div class="redheading"><a name="q3"></a>II. Information We Collect</div>
<p align="justify">
Ecommerce may request or collect  personal information from online users in a variety of ways, including through  online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where  users are invited to volunteer such information.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The data we collect is information that identifies you personally, such as: name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone numbers, website URLs, credit card information and other billing information. This information is used for billing and service purposes for the products or services you. With this information, you can expect to receive billing notices, renewal reminders and important service related correspondence. If you do not wish to provide us with this information or do not wish to receive communications from us, do not signup.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Ecommerce may also collect information about how users access the website using a tracking ID unique to each user through the use of cookies. This information is for internal use only and does not personally identify you in any way.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Cookies may also be used by third party affiliate sites to verify any purchase you might make so that they make rightfully earn their duly earned commissions. The affiliate tracking cookies only tag your purchase from their referral site to ours and do not personally identify you in any way to the third party.

<div align="right" class="right"><a href="/privacy-policy/#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" vspace="10" width="76" height="13" border="0" alt="Back To Top" style="margin-bottom:25px;"></a></div>

<div class="redheading"><a name="q4"></a>III. What are Cookies?</div>
<p align="justify">
A cookie is a piece of data  stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use  both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once  you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A  persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for  an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and  instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by  Ecommerce to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website.  They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent  cookies may be used by Ecommerce to store whether, for example, you want your  password remembered or not, and other information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site
</p>
<p align="justify">
Some of our business partners (e.g., HumanClick) use cookies on our site.&nbsp; We have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by HumanClick (Domain: server.iad.liverperson.net, our Live Chat application) only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>

<div align="right" class="right"><a href="/privacy-policy/#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" vspace="10" width="76" height="13" border="0" alt="Back To Top" style="margin-bottom:25px;"></a></div>

<div class="redheading"><a name="q5"></a>IV. Log Files</div>
<p align="justify">
Like most standard websites, we  use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses,  browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform  type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the  site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use. None of the information stored in the log files  is linked to personally identifiable information.
</p>

<div align="right" class="right"><a href="/privacy-policy/#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" vspace="10" width="76" height="13" border="0" alt="Back To Top" style="margin-bottom:25px;"></a></div>

<div class="redheading"><a name="q6"></a>V. How we use this information</div>
<p align="justify">
Ecommerce may use the personally  identifiable information collected by Ecommerce to contact customers regarding  products and services offered by Ecommerce and, to the extent the user has  agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business  partners. We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the  effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales  efforts. Ecommerce will not in any way share this information with a third  party either for free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorize such  disclosures.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. No information will be collected or provided to third parties without your prior knowledge.
</p>

<div align="right" class="right"><a href="/privacy-policy/#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" vspace="10" width="76" height="13" border="0" alt="Back To Top" style="margin-bottom:25px;"></a></div>

<div class="redheading"><a name="q7"></a>VI. Disclosure of Information</div>
<p align="justify">
Ecommerce may also disclose  aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to  investors and potential partners. In such cases, only statistical information  will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept strictly  confidential. In case Ecommerce is sold, the information collected from users  may be transferred to the new owners.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Ecommerce may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by Ecommerce from its customers. In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as Ecommerce and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p align="justify">
We use various credit card processing companies to bill you for our services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. No other third party services are used to provide the services you purchase from us, thusly no personally identifiable information is provided beyond our service.
</p>

<div align="right" class="right"><a href="/privacy-policy/#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" vspace="10" width="76" height="13" border="0" alt="Back To Top" style="margin-bottom:25px;"></a></div>

<div class="redheading"><a name="q8"></a>VII. Special Offers and Updates</div>
<p align="justify">
Our customers and users will  occasionally receive newsletters or e-mails with information on products,  services, or special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users,  Ecommerce gives them the opportunity to opt-out from receiving these types of  communications.

<div class="redheading"><a name="q9"></a>VIII. Legal Disclaimer</div>
<p align="justify">
Though we make every effort to  preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when  required by law, if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary  and required to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order,  subpoena or other legal process served on Ecommerce.

<p align="justify">
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

<p align="justify">
The Ecommerce website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Ecommerce is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. The Ecommerce Privacy Policy as described herein applies solely to information collected by Ecommerce.

<div align="right" class="right"><a href="/privacy-policy/#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" vspace="10" width="76" height="13" border="0" alt="Back To Top" style="margin-bottom:25px;"></a></div>

<div class="redheading"><a name="q10"></a>IX. Maintenance and Security of Information</div>
<p align="justify">
The information provided to  Ecommerce is saved and may be stored on one or more databases directly or  indirectly maintained by Ecommerce. Ecommerce employs industry-standard  security measures and is CISP certified to protect the confidentiality of the  information. Machines that store sensitive customer information are kept in  compliance with CISP regulations. These machines are heavily secured and  firewalled, protected on an internal network. Backups are kept physically  protected in secure locations.
</p>
<p align="justify">
While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers collected for commercial transactions, is encrypted prior to transmission by you to Ecommerce.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you  enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security  number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using  secure socket layer technology (SSL).&nbsp; To  learn more about SSL, follow this link:<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssl" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssl</a>
</p>
<p align="justify">
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.&nbsp; No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <script type="text/javascript">eval(unescape('%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%77%72%69%74%65%28%27%3c%61%20%68%72%65%66%3d%22%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%69%6e%66%6f%40%65%63%6f%6d%6d%65%72%63%65%2e%63%6f%6d%22%20%3e%69%6e%66%6f%40%65%63%6f%6d%6d%65%72%63%65%2e%63%6f%6d%3c%2f%61%3e%27%29%3b'))</script><a href="mailto:info@ecommerce.com">info@ecommerce.com</a>.
