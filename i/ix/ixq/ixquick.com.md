# PRIVACY - Privacy Policy

###  In short: | Ixquick does not collect or share any personal information!  
Nada. Zilch. Nothing.  
---|---  
The longer version: | Ixquick is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. This privacy policy details the - very limited and non-personal - information Ixquick.com ("Ixquick") may gather and our disclosure policy.  
  
## IP Addresses

### The IP address that is associated with your search will NOT be recorded.  
The only exception is for “abusive” (automated) queriers that rapidly submit many queries to Ixquick in a very short time.

## Data Collection

### We don't collect any personal information on our visitors. Nada. Zilch. Zero.  
When you use Ixquick, we do not record your IP address, we do not record which browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome etc.), we do not record your computer platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), and we do not record your search words or phrases. In fact, the only information we do record is an aggregate total of how many searches are performed on our website each day (a measure of overall traffic), and those overall traffic numbers broken down by language, and statistics on a purely aggregate level.

Zero data collection policy.

IP

BROWSER

OS

SEARCHES

This zero data collection policy protects your privacy, since your IP address, browser, and platform information can be combined with other data to [uniquely identify](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) your computer, your location, or you. It is also important not to record search terms, since they can convey personal information as well. (Think of someone entering their own name and/or social security number.)

## Cookies

### Ixquick does not use identifying cookies.  
Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites. Ixquick uses only one anonymous cookie called "preferences". This cookie is to remember the search preferences you saved for your next visit. It expires after 90 days.

You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. It should be noted, however, that your Ixquick.com preferences will not work properly if your cookies are turned off. It is possible to accept cookies from selected sites only.

You can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site.

To promote a cookie-free internet, Ixquick has a [URL generator](https://web.archive.org/eng/urlgenerator-details.html) which eradicates the need for setting a cookie. It remembers your settings in a privacy friendly manner. It can be found at the bottom of the [SETTINGS](https://web.archive.org/do/preferences.pl?language=english) page.

## External Links

### Ixquick offers a proxy function that allows the users to see the information on external sites without disclosing their IP address to these sites.  
As a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various links on our site, including but not limited to search results and sponsored results. These sites are owned and maintained by independent companies, over which Ixquick has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Ixquick is not liable or responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection of information and its use. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the Ixquick.com website. Ixquick offers a proxy function that allows the users to see the information on external sites without disclosing their IP address to these sites. Further information on this great privacy tool can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/proxy/eng/help.html). 

## Email addresses

###  Ixquick will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties.  
When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Ixquick via email, and include an email address and/or contact information Ixquick may use this information to respond to you. Ixquick will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties. We may, however, very occasionally send emails to our users regarding Ixquick company information. This service is opt-in and includes the option to unsubscribe.

## Children Under 13 Years of Age

### Note that we do not collect any personal data at all.  
As a consequence Ixquick does not knowingly request, collect, or share personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13 either. We feel protecting children's privacy online is very important.

## Information Sharing

### Ixquick has no personal information to share.  
Ixquick does not share personal information with any third party search engine or the provider of its sponsored results. Click [here](https://web.archive.org/eng/information-sharing.html) for details.

## Governmental requests

### Ixquick is headquartered in The Netherlands, Europe. Any request or demand from any government (including the US) to deliver user data, will be thoroughly checked by our lawyers, and we will not comply unless the law which actually applies to us would undeniably require it from us. And even in that hypothetical situation, we would refer to the fact we have no personal user data to share. In the fourteen years we've been in business, we have never received such a request.

The only legitimate way that we see to make us start collecting personal information, is if there is a valid warrant or court order, obliging us to do so in relation to a specific user because that person is suspected to have committed a crime which is serious enough to warrant such a restriction of privacy.

## Your privacy, our future

### We strongly believe that we have the legal right to safeguard the privacy of our users by encrypting and not collecting their personal information, and to keep doing so.

Given the strong protection of the right to privacy in Europe, European governments cannot just start forcing service providers like us to implement a blanket spying program on their users. If that ever changed, we would fight this to the end.

Privacy  
It's not just our Policy - it's our Mission!
