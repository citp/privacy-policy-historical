The following describes some of the circumstances under which your information may be disclosed.</p><p><u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>.

No personal information will be transferred in the event of a merger or sale unless the recipient has committed to the SPP principles. </p><p><u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>. Under confidentiality agreements, IXL Learning may match non-student accountholder information with third party data. Also, IXL Learning discloses aggregated user statistics (for instance, the percentage of IXL users from a particular geographic region) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p><p><u>Vendors and Service Providers</u>. IXL Learning may disclose information collected from you to vendors or service providers who are under an obligation of confidentiality to IXL Learning for the purpose of providing services or products for us or on our behalf, including for purposes of analytics, billing, and marketing.

However, IXL will not knowingly use student information for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.</p><p><u>Educational Institution Affiliation</u>. IXL Learning may disclose information collected from users associated with an educational institution with other users designated by the educational institution, such as teachers and school administrators of that institution. </p><p><u>Other</u>. IXL Learning may release personal information if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of IXL Learning, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>

  <p>IXL Learning accounts are created by parents and educational institutions. IXL Learning does not permit children under the age of 13 to create an account and does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or educational institution. IXL Learning may collect and store question answers provided by users of accounts created by parents and educational institutions for the purpose of providing feedback to the user and educational institution and for compiling reports and awards. IXL Learning may also collect and store an e-mail address provided by users of accounts created by parents and educational institutions for the purpose of password reset. IXL Learning will not ask children under age 13 for more information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. Any disclosure of information collected from children under the age of 13 to third parties will be pursuant to an agreement of confidentiality and may be used for purposes of site analytics, billing and marketing. If any information is disclosed to IXL Learning by a child under the age of 13, that child's parent may contact IXL using the contact information below to ascertain the information collected and/or to request its deletion.</p>

The pages thus created may be accessed by anyone. Please do not include any information on your Web page that you do not want to disclose over the Internet.</p>
