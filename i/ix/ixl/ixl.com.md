**What personally identifiable information does Quia Corporation collect from me?**  
Quia Corporation collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. Quia Corporation asks for your name and e-mail address, and we also ask you to choose a username and password.

In addition to the information we collect when you register, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support team. Furthermore, when you send e-mail, user surveys, or other communication to Quia, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services.

**What are cookies and how does Quia Corporation use them?**  
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Quia Corporation uses cookies to temporarily store information about you. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to better display our Web site, to save you time, and to provide better technical support. For example, cookies help us to:

(1) keep track of whether a registered user is logged in so that we can display the "Log In" or "Log Out" link as appropriate

(2) remember the last tab you visited in the Instructor Zone so that if you leave the Instructor Zone and return, we can start you on the tab you left off at

(3) know your username when you submit a technical support request so that you don't have to type it in.

(4) remember that you have logged in, so that you don't have to re-enter your username and password every time you go to the Instructor Zone, Student Zone, or other area of our site that is restricted to registered users.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Quia features and services (particularly those that require you to log in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

**How does Quia Corporation use my information?**  
Quia Corporation's goals in collecting personal information are to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our sites and a high level of technical support. 

Quia Corporation does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users; for instance, this information often gives us ideas for improving our products. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

**Who is collecting information?**  
When you are on a Quia Corporation site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Quia Corporation alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected or maintained by any company other than Quia Corporation, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.

**With whom does Quia Corporation share my information?**  
As a general rule, Quia Corporation will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the reasons that your information may be disclosed. _Business Partners & Sponsors_. Quia Corporation will never disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, unless it is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. If Quia Corporation becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. _Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate_. Under confidentiality agreements, Quia Corporation may match user information with third party data. Also, Quia Corporation discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 8% of our users are from California) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. _Other_. Quia Corporation may release personal information if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Quia, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

Quia Corporation does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.

**What about children's privacy?**  
Quia Corporation does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. Quia Corporation does not gather information on the ages of our users and will never knowingly share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties. When contacting our users, Quia Corporation requests that anyone under the age of 13 forward the e-mail to a parent or guardian. All Quia account holders, including parents and children with Quia accounts, are subject to this Privacy Policy.

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas) that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

When creating materials on the Quia Web site, you may choose whether or not to show your name and e-mail address. If you decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making it available to others over the Internet. Furthermore, if you have chosen to have your name displayed on your Quia activity pages and you add one of your activities to the Quia shared activities area, your name will appear in the listing of activities. Remember that the choice of displaying your name and e-mail address on the Quia Web site is entirely up to you. By publishing your name and e-mail address, you may receive correspondence from other Quia users. For example, someone may send you an e-mail to let you know that your activity was helpful, or to point out errors in your activity. Many Quia users appreciate the opportunity to receive this kind of feedback; however, the choice to include this information is yours.

Additionally, Quia offers a web-page building tool, specifically designed to allow educators to build custom class Web pages. Just like any other web-page building tool, the pages created can be accessed by anyone over the Internet. Please do not include any information on your web page that you do not want to disclose over the Internet.
