By your decision to submit your personal information to Australia Immigration Professionals through its website and/or via the application and/or using any of the methods described in this Privacy Policy, you hereby declare and obligate the following:

A.  Personal information that you provide to Australia Immigration Professionals belongs to you and is accurate, complete and correct.

#### **Minors**

To the extent that your consent is a basis for collecting personal information about you, there is an age requirement for you to be at least 16 years of age (or to be at least 13 years of age, if this is what has been determined by the law in your country). In the event that you do not meet the minimum age requirements, you must receive consent from your parent or guardian so that information can be processed in adherence to this Privacy Policy, and if you lack such consent, Australia Immigration Professionals will not provide you with its services and/or products. Australia Immigration Professionals reserves the right, at the discretion of the company, to request information and proof regarding your age.

Australia Immigration Professionals recognizes the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information the company may process from children on our websites, channels and applications. Personal information for underage individuals (aged 16 and less) will be stored only after their legal guardian consents, and will be used only to deliver the application to the relevant authorities. Australia Immigration Professionals won’t register an individual 16 years old (or younger) as a client.

When you visit our website, our company system assigns an identifying number to the device that you used to access our website and a cookie file is installed on that device. There may also be times when our company permits the installation of cookie files on your device (either on a temporary basis or permanently) by third parties which are related to their websites, services and/or products.

#### **Data Controller**

Australia Immigration Professionals serves as the Data Controller of the personal information about you.

In the event that you have enrolled to receive services offered by Australia Immigration Professionals, but a portion of that service is provided by a third party, the third party will serve as a separate “Data Controller.”

Furthermore, Australia Immigration Professionals is part of a Group of companies that also includes: AbroadEd, Become A Canadian, Green Card Lottery Experts, Jobs Across the World, Natively Academy, and New Zealand Visa Expert.

Each company in the Group conducts certain activities that make up a portion of the Group’s overall activity, which involves relocation, immigration, and education. In this activity, the members of the Group share among themselves personal information about individuals for their internal purposes.

Thus, personal information that Australia Immigration Professionals collects about you may be shared with the other companies in the Group and these other companies may utilize that personal information only for their internal requirements. Similarly, personal information collected about you by other companies in the Group may be shared with Australia Immigration Professionals, which will utilize it only for its internal purposes.

In each of the above cases, Australia Immigration Professionals and the other companies in the Group will be considered “Joint Data Controllers” in regards to personal information about you, and they will be responsible individually and collectively for complying with the requirements to safeguard your personal information.

If you would like to realize your rights about personal information or should you have any questions about activities related to the processing of your personal information, please feel free to contact Australia Immigration Professionals, which will handle your request even if it involves another member of the Group, at the company’s address provided above, or by sending an email to: **[privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au](mailto:privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au)**

Additionally, you may contact members of the Group which process your personal information as well as Australia Immigration Professionals.

#### **Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties**

In addition to sharing personal information about you with other companies in the Group of companies that Australia Immigration Professionals is a part of, in support of general activities or internal needs of the companies in the Group (as discussed in the Data Controller section above), Australia Immigration Professionals may also share your personal information with third parties such as those listed below:

A.  Immigration agents, lawyers, consultants, or other third parties (among others) that facilitate the process for relocation/immigration/education services (as relevant);

B.  Third parties providing services or supplies that help our company to provide you with the services and/or products that you request (for example, accountants, IT services, legal advisers, payment processing services, etc.);

C.  Officials involved with certain legal or related matters (for example, public authorities dealing with immigration, customs, security, etc.);

D.  Officials in different countries in order satisfy certain legal requirements;

E.  We may offer you the services and/or products of third parties that are our company’s business partners and if you indicate an interest in these offers, we may provide your personal information to those third parties.

Please note that Australia Immigration Professionals will send your personal information to the third party on the date in which it is requested or when necessary (as relevant).

#### **Data Protection in the European Union**

For issues concerning European regulations for privacy protection, please contact our Privacy Officer by sending an email to: **[privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au](mailto:privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au)**

#### **Consequences of Not Providing Your Personal Information**

There is no obligation for you to provide your personal information to Australia Immigration Professionals. It should be noted, however, that Australia Immigration Professionals may not be able to provide you with the services and/or products that you request from our company unless you submit your personal information.

Although you are not required to provide Australia Immigration Professionals with your personal information, there are certain situations in which providing your personal information is a necessary condition for establishing a contractual relationship between you and Australia Immigration Professionals. Therefore, a decision by you not to provide Australia Immigration Professionals with your personal information may prevent our company from entering into a contractual agreement with you and consequently, we may not be able to provide you with the services and/or products that you asked to receive from our company.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned, these rules will apply concerning particular users: In general, with the exception of any lawful requirement for users to provide our company with specific information, you are not legally obligated to provide Australia Immigration Professionals with your personal information, and you have the freedom to decide whether or not to do so. In the event that you decide not to provide Australia Immigration Professionals with your personal information in accordance with the company’s requirements, Australia Immigration Professionals may be prevented from responding to your request and/or may not be able to provide you with the services and/or products that you ask to receive.

#### **You May Request That Your Personal Information Not be Used for Marketing**

Australia Immigration Professionals seeks to take into account the needs and personal preferences of its potential and current customers in order to provide them with relevant content and offers. With this goal in mind, Australia Immigration Professionals conducts analyses of personal information using certain technologies and techniques in order to reach conclusions regarding content and offers that you may find personally relevant. Furthermore, to the extent that you agree to be sent marketing offers from Australia Immigration Professionals, our company can refine its offers made to you by using the conclusions drawn from these analyses of your data.

You have the right to request at any time and without cost that Australia Immigration Professionals not use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, by sending an email with the subject line “Unsubscribe” to: **[privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au](mailto:privacy@immiproaustralia.com.au)** Please note that if you decide on this option, your personal information (such as your contact details) will still be saved by Australia Immigration Professionals, but our company will not use your information to send marketing materials, as discussed in the previous paragraph.

#### **You Have Rights Regarding Your Personal Information**

You have several rights regarding your personal information, such as the following:

**The Right to Review Your Personal Information –** You have the right to ask our company to confirm if it has personal information about you and if it does, you can also request to be sent a copy of your personal information, pending our company’s confirmation of your identity so as to prevent the transfer of your personal information to an unauthorized third party.

E.  your personal information needs to be deleted due to legal requirements placed upon our company;

**The Right to Object to Your Personal Information Being Used –** At any time, you have the right to object, for your own reasons, to your personal information being processed, given that the legal basis for your personal information being processed is the carrying out of a task or tasks for the public good, implementing official authority granted to our company or satisfying the legitimate interests of our company and/or a third party, such as producing a profile about you by virtue of the above lawful bases, and there are no decisive legitimate reasons to process your personal information that outweigh your rights, freedoms or interests.

It is important to note that your right to have your personal information sent to you or to a different Data Controller only applies to your personal information that was processed with your consent or to take steps at your request prior to signing a contract or based upon the requirement to implement a contract to which you are a party. It must also be stressed that it is not acceptable to impinge upon the right of our company to keep a copy of your personal information as determined by European regulations concerning privacy protection.
