Our Web server routinely collects and stores information provided by your Web browser such as the pages visited on our site, the date and time of the visit, the Internet address (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the IP address or your connection to the Internet, the version of browser used, and the capabilities of the browser. IAC makes no attempt to identify individual visitors from this information.  
IAC has taken steps to make information received from online visitors as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use. All information is protected by security measures that are periodically reviewed.  
This site contains many links to other websites not under the control of IAC. IAC accepts no responsibility for the privacy practices or failures of those websites.
