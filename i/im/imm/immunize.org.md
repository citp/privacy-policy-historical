Except for certain order pages that employ a third-party shopping cart, and certain survey pages, this site does not use "cookie" technology, including the  recording of visitor information on your computer system for automatic retrieval when you subsequently visit our website.  
Our Web server routinely collects and stores information provided by your Web browser such as the pages visited on our site, the date and time of the visit, the Internet address (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the IP address or your connection to the Internet, the version of browser used, and the capabilities of the browser.
