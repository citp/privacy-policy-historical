---  
The Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) treats the issue of privacy seriously. We do not sell, distribute, barter, or transfer email addresses or any other individually identifiable user information to third parties. Any information collected on this website is used only for the purposes stated.   
Only persons who ask to be added to email lists or request information receive email communications. You may request that your email address be removed from the IAC subscriber lists at any time and we will do so promptly.  
Except for certain order pages that employ a third-party shopping cart, and certain survey pages, this site does not use "cookie" technology, including the  recording of visitor information on your computer system for automatic retrieval when you subsequently visit our website.  
Our Web server routinely collects and stores information provided by your Web browser such as the pages visited on our site, the date and time of the visit, the Internet address (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the IP address or your connection to the Internet, the version of browser used, and the capabilities of the browser. IAC makes no attempt to identify individual visitors from this information.  
IAC has taken steps to make information received from online visitors as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use. All information is protected by security measures that are periodically reviewed.  
This site contains many links to other websites not under the control of IAC. IAC accepts no responsibility for the privacy practices or failures of those websites.  
The Immunization Action Coalition may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions and you agree that it is your responsibility to review the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your access to this website.
