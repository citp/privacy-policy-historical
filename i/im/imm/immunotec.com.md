         acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose the personal data we collect and
         maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention
         or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g. a subpoena or court
         order) or law; (b) enforce our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you,
         including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content

         on policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures to meet security objectives while supporting
         business and operational goals.
    •    To assist in Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or
         partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such
         transactions) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of
         Immunotec, Inc.’s assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer personal data
         (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such
         transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Immunotec, Inc.
         will comply with such restrictions.

our market research, but we will do so only after we “anonymize” or “pseudonymize” the data, i.e.,
remove information that would confirm your identity. We will not use your personal data, however, to
send commercial or marketing messages to you unless we have a legal basis for doing so, such as your
consent or a contract with us for which, in either case, you will have the ability to opt out of by sending
an email to info@immunotec.com

Transferring personal data from the EU to the US or other jurisdictions
The Company has its headquarters in Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec, Canada J7V 5V5. Personal data we
collect from you will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a
finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. The Company relies on
derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, the Company collects
and transfers to the U.S. personal data only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to
fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of the Company in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and
freedoms. The Company endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of
your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with the Company and the practices
described in this Privacy Policy. The Company also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by not
collecting or storing sensitive information about you.
The 8 Rights of Individuals
Under the GDPR, You will benefit from increased rights including:
1.         The right to be informed
The right to be informed encompasses the obligation to provide you with ‘fair processing information.’ It
emphasizes the need for transparency over how your personal data is used.
2.         The right of access
Under the GDPR, you will have the right to obtain confirmation that your data is being processed, access
to your personal data, and other supplementary information.


3.      The right to rectification
You are entitled to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
4.      The right to erasure
The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten.’ You may request the deletion or removal
of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.
5.      The right to restrict processing
We are permitted to store your personal data, but not further process it without consent.
6.      The right to data portability
The right to data portability allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes
across different services. You may move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment
to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.
7.      The right to object
You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in
the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling), direct marketing (including profiling);
and processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
8.      Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
The GDPR provides safeguards for you against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is taken
without human intervention.

This site, like many others, uses small files called cookies to help us customize your experience. Find
out more about cookies and how you can control them.
This page contains information on what cookies are, the cookies used by the Immunotec, Inc. ("us," “we,”
“our,” or “Company”) website, how to switch cookies off in your browser, how to specifically switch off
advertising cookies, and some useful links for further reading on the subject. If it does not provide the
information you were looking for, or you have any further questions about the use of cookies on the
Company website, please email info@immunotec.com
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored by the browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Safari) on
your computer or mobile phone. They allow websites to store things including your user preferences.
Think of cookies as providing a ‘memory’ for the website, so that it can recognize you when you come
back and respond appropriately.
How do we use cookies?
On our Site, you may encounter the following types of cookie:
Site performance cookies
Anonymous analytics cookies
Geotargetting cookies
Registration cookies
Advertising cookies
Third party advertising cookies
Site performance cookies
This type of cookie remembers your preferences for tools found on the Company’s website, so you don’t
have to re-set them each time you visit. Examples include:
– Volume settings for our video player
– Whether you see new content first
– Video streaming speeds that are compatible with your browser
Anonymous analytics cookies:
Every time someone visits our website, software provided by another organization generates an
“anonymous analytics cookie.” These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before.


Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies and, if you don’t, we generate new ones. This allows
us to track how many individual users we have, and how often they visit the site.
Unless you are signed in to the Site, we cannot use these cookies to identify individuals. We use them to
gather statistics, for example, the number of visits to a page. If you are logged in, we will also know the
details you gave to us for this, such as your username and email address.
Geotargetting cookies
These cookies are used by software which tries to work out what country you are in from the information
supplied by your browser when you click on a web page. This cookie is completely anonymous, and we
only use it to help target our content – such as whether you see a country specific home page – and
advertising.
Registration cookies
When you register with us, we generate cookies that let us know whether you are signed in or not. Our
servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access
to a particular service. It also allows us to associate any comments you post with your username. If you
have not selected “keep me signed in”, your cookies get deleted when you either close your browser or
shut down your computer. While you are signed into either of the sites, we combine information from
your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have
seen.
Advertising cookies
These cookies allow us to know whether or not you’ve seen a particular ad or a type of advertisement,
and how long it is since you’ve seen it. We also use cookies to help us use targeted advertising. We may
use cookies set by another organization so we can more accurately target advertising to you. These
cookies are anonymous – they store information about what you are looking at on our site, but not about
who you are.
Third party advertising cookies
Some content you see on the Site is provided by other organizations. Some of these organizations use
their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many
people have seen it more than once. The companies that generate these cookies have their
own privacy policies, and we have no access to read or write these cookies. These organizations may use
their cookies to anonymously target advertising to you on other websites, based on your visit to the Site.
Other third party cookies
On some pages of our website, other organizations may also set their own anonymous cookies. They do
this to track the success of their application, or to customize the application for you. Because of how


cookies work, our website cannot access these cookies, nor can the other organization access the data in
cookies we use on our website.
How do I turn cookies off?
It is usually possible to stop your browser accepting cookies, or to stop it accepting cookies from a
particular website. However, we cannot tell if you are signed in without using cookies, so you would not
be able to post comments.
All modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the
Options or Preferences menu of your browser. To understand these settings, the following links may be
helpful, or you can use the Help option in your browser for more details.
