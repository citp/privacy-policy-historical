# Privacy Policy :: Imhosted.com :: The world's web hosting solution.

Privacy for our customers is extremely important to ImHosted™. We strongly believe in individual's rights to privacy and that personal information is not a commodity and should not be treated as one. At all times we will never share your personal information with any third parties without your permission. 

Your email addresses are not for sale or trade and are strictly guarded. Our Acceptable Usage Policy prohibits our customers from sending unsolicited bulk commercial email (aka "spam") using our services. If it is brought to our attention that one of our customers is violating this policy, we take steps to stop them and ensure it doesn't happen again. We also do everything within our power to keep non-customers from using our email servers for spam. 

All client information such as email, phone numbers, addresses, etc is used only for internal purposes. This contact information is used to get in touch with you when necessary and for announcements and our monthly newsletter. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services.
