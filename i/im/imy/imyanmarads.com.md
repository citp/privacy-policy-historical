**1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology  
**  
iMyanmarAds currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, iMyanmarAds may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.

(a) Cookies

"Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of iMyanmarAds's websites, you need to accept cookies.

(b) Web Beacons

A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows iMyanmarAds to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. 

(c) IP Addresses

iMyanmarAds automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.

(d) Computer Profiles

iMyanmarAds may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, iMyanmarAds may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. 

(e) New Technology

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, iMyanmarAds strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.

**1.6. No Information Collected from Users under 13 Years of Age  
**  
iMyanmarAds requires its registrants be 13 years of age or above. iMyanmarAds will never knowingly collect any personal information about users under the age of 13. If iMyanmarAds obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, iMyanmarAds has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. 

**2\. Use of Individual Information  
**  
The following section describes how iMyanmarAds uses personal information. The uses described in these sections may change at any time. iMyanmarAds may also broaden its use of your personal information. iMyanmarAds may also use your personal information to provide commercial promotional offers to individuals or entities through, among other things, email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, banner advertising and package stuffers.

**2.2. Email  
**  
iMyanmarAds uses your personal information to provide promotional offers by email to you. iMyanmarAds may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. Because iMyanmarAds only sends emails when you have agreed to receive emails from iMyanmarAds or you have agreed to receive emails from third parties, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to email messages sent by iMyanmarAds.

**2.3. Profiling and Target Advertising**

iMyanmarAds uses your information to make and improve profiles of you and to track your online browsing habits and determine which areas of iMyanmarAds's websites are most frequently visited. This information helps iMyanmarAds to better understand your interests so that it can target advertising and promotions to you. iMyanmarAds may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.

**2.4. Storage of Personal Information  
**  
iMyanmarAds stores your information in a database on iMyanmarAds's servers. Our servers have security measures (provided by our hosting company) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under iMyanmarAds's control.
