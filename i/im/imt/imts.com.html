			    <p>
		      <strong>Effective April 2010</strong></p>
			    <p>
			     
			      Welcome to the website for  the International Manufacturing Technology Show (“IMTS”), which is brought to  you by AMT - The Association For Manufacturing Technology ("AMT").  This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected through the IMTS  website, www.imts.com, (the “Site”) and the ways in which AMT may use,  disclose, and protect that information. Please note that this Privacy Policy  does not apply to other sites and services operated by AMT.&nbsp; Please be sure to review this entire Privacy  Policy carefully before submitting any information through the Site. If you  have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this  Policy for information on how to contact us.<br>
  <br>
			      AMT may&nbsp;update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and  services. When we post changes to this Policy, we will revise the "effective"  date at the top of this page and the new version will be effective from the  time it is posted. This Privacy Policy outlines the online data collection,  use, and disclosure practices of AMT with respect to personal information  collected from you through the Site (a "User").&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
			      AMT receives and stores any information you enter on our website. This includes  information that can identify you ("personal information"), such as  your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing  information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date).&nbsp;We  also may request information about the company for which you work and your job  function. You can choose not to provide us with any personal information, but  some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member,  ask a question, or initiate other transactions on our site.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
			      In addition, when you visit the Site, your browser automatically transmits  certain information to AMT, such as the location of your computer on the  Internet, that could, in connection with other information, be identified as  coming from you. Further, as discussed below, AMT may use cookies and other Web  technologies on the Site, which may enable AMT to collect additional  information.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
			      AMT uses personal information collected on the Site for purposes  reasonably related to operating the Site, including to determine whether a User  is authorized for access to members-only or other restricted-access areas, to  fulfill orders for publications, to register Users, to provide customer support,  and to deliver other products and services to you. In addition, AMT may also  use information collected on the Site to communicate with you, to improve the  content and functioning of the Site, and for other internal business purposes.<br>
                </p>
			    <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br>
			      AMT may disclose your information to third-party hosting services, vendors,  suppliers, content providers, and consultants of AMT or its affiliates in order  to respond to requests made by you or to aid in the maintenance and operation  of the Site. AMT may also disclose your information to exhibitors at IMTS, who  may contact you about products and services in which we hope you are  interested.&nbsp; In addition, AMT may  disclose your personal information:<br>
  <br>
			      (a) In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order,  or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency, state and federal  regulatory agency, or other government agency; to establish or exercise our  legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or whenever AMT otherwise  believes that it is required by law to do so. In such cases, we may raise or  waive any legal objection or right available to us.<br>
  <br>
			      (b) When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate,  prevent, or take other action regarding suspected fraud or other wrongdoing;  to&nbsp;enforce&nbsp;our Terms of Use; to protect the safety or property  interests of AMT and its employees; or to protect the safety of the public. <br>
  <br>
			      AMT may use in any manner, and disclose to third parties, aggregated  information about Users in a form that does not personally identify you.<br>
  </p>
			    <p><strong>Tracking and Facilitating Site Usage</strong><br>
			      AMT may use cookies (small unique identifiers)&nbsp;and other technologies to  recognize you and facilitate your access privileges on the Site, as well as to  track Site usage. Users whose browsers are configured not to accept cookies may  not be able to access all or part of the Site. Some links found on the Site may  contain or result in the use of cookies that are set by third parties. AMT does  not control and is not responsible for such cookies. AMT also logs technical  information, such as the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems  administration and troubleshooting purposes.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
			    <p><strong>Protection of Personal Information</strong><br>
			      AMT employs a variety of security measures to help protect your personal  information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only  employees of AMT and employees of third-party hosting services, vendors,  suppliers, content providers, or consultants are permitted access to personal  information of Users in the course of operating the Site, and they may do so  only for permitted business functions. AMT also encourages its third-party  hosting services, vendors, suppliers, content providers, and consultants to  abide by this Privacy Policy. Although we take steps to protect your personal  information, please note that no Internet transmission is 100% secure or  error-free. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your  personal information or other communications will always remain private. AMT  cannot assume, and expressly disclaims, to the maximal extent permitted by law,  any responsibility or liability for any information collected by AMT or any  other party or for any use, misuse, disclosure, or improper disclosure of such  information.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Third-Party Websites</strong><br>
			      The Site may contain hyperlinks to websites of affiliates, advertisers,  or others. Such sites are operated by third parties and are not under the  control of AMT. Personal information that you provide to third-party sites is  not covered by this Privacy Policy, and AMT does not have any control over  third-party sites' collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information.  Likewise, disclosures made to third parties unaffiliated with AMT using any  feature of the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy with respect to  those third parties' uses or disclosures of your personal information. AMT has  no control over persons or entities to whom you may send personal information,  and it is your responsibility to protect against unwanted use or disclosure of  information provided to third parties using any feature that may be offered by  AMT.<br>
              </p>
			    <p><strong>Access to Personal Information</strong><br>
			      If you have provided personal information to register as a member or in  response to a specific request for personal information from AMT, you may  update or correct your personal information by contacting AMT through the means  listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.<br>
              </p>
			    <p><strong>Consent to Collection, Use, and Disclosure  of Personal Information</strong><br>
			      By providing personal information to AMT or otherwise using the Site, you  consent to AMT's collection, use, and disclosure of such information in  accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to the other statements in the Privacy  Policy, as it may be revised. You should check the Site regularly for changes to  the Privacy Policy. AMT may, in its sole discretion, use other or additional  means to notify you of changes in this Privacy Policy. If we make any material  changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the  e-mail address that you most recently provided to us, and/or by prominently  posting notice of the changes on the Site.<br>
              </p>
			    <p><strong>Site Use on Behalf of Another</strong><br>
			      If you enter information or otherwise use the Site on behalf of another person  or entity, you consent both on your own behalf and on behalf of that other  person or entity to AMT's collection, use, and disclosure of such information,  whether it is information of yours or information of such other person or  entity, in accordance with this Privacy Statement. You also represent and  warrant that you have the authority to consent on behalf of such other person  or entity.<br>
              </p>
			    <p><strong>Contact Information</strong><br>
	          If you&nbsp;have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or the collection  or use of personal information by AMT, or if you wish to opt out of any e-mail  list, you may contact AMT by writing a letter to IMTS Webmaster, 7901 Westpark Drive, McLean, VA 22102, or by sending an e-mail  to  <a href="/email_form.cfm?sect=#url.sect#&amp;eto=bgurney@amtonline.org">webmaster@imts.com</a><a href="dhtmled3:mailtamtwebmaster@amtonline.org"></a>.</p>
