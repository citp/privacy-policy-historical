# InsureMyTrip Privacy, Security and Legal Policies

### Introduction

This statement discloses the privacy practices of IMT SERVICES CORPORATION (IMT) and its owned and operated web sites which are located at URLs: InsureMyTrip.com and InsureMyTraveler.com. When you visit a web site, you expect to know what personal information is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use, distribution and disclosure of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of this information under the web site's control and the method for accessing the personal information that we have collected about you and request that such information be rectified or deleted. Questions regarding this statement, access requests or inaccuracies in the information should be directed to customercare@insuremytrip.com. We will respond to your inquiry or request within thirty (30) days.

This privacy statement is an Agreement. If you choose to provide personal information to us, the handling of your personal information will be governed by the terms and conditions contained herein. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions contained herein, please do not provide IMT with any personal information.

### Overview

IMT encourages you to visit our web sites knowing that you have complete control over your personal information. You can browse our pages without having to tell us who you are or revealing any personal information whatsoever. However, if you communicate with our customer service department via online chat, email or phone, you might supply us with personal information such as your name, email address and other contact information. Also, if you decide to purchase travel insurance, the applications will require you to input more information such as name and address, travel arrangements and credit card information in order for us to service you appropriately. We do indicate on these pages of the web site that we are collecting this information from you and the purposes for doing so, except where it is obvious. We will not use your personal information for other purposes without notifying you of our intention to do so and obtaining your consent.

IMT is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites on the Internet that are hyper-linked to or from our site.

For our Canadian visitors, we endorse and adopt in their entirety, the ten principles of the Canadian Standard Associations' Model Code for Protection of Personal Information.

### Information Gathering

The IMT web sites collect the following information only if you choose to provide it:

  * For a question or request ("Contact Us", "Service" and the "Live Chat" areas): 
    * Name, email address and any comments you make.
  * For a quote: 
    * Coverage limits, dates of travel, age(s) or date(s) of birth for each traveller, destination, trip type, and residency.
  * For a travel policy, on behalf of the insurance carriers, we collect from you and disclose to them the following information: 
    * Name, mailing address, telephone number(s), Email Address, trip deposit date, tour operator, airline and/or cruise line and trip departure hour.
    * Credit Card Information.
  * For user accounts: 
    * Name, email address, and password.



### Using Information Gathered

The information collected when you contact us with a question or a suggestion will only be used to respond to and/or resolve your question.

The information collected for a quote or for a travel policy is used to provide policy quotes and to issue your policy. The information is in turn sent encrypted, only to the insurance company underwriting the policy and the producing agent if applicable. The insurance companies employ standard encryption practices receiving such information.

IMT archives information provided by you for policy quoting and policy issuance on our servers located in the United States. This information is kept electronically, but is internal to IMT and not maintained on the web site. We collect and retain this information in accordance with all applicable laws, including without limitation insurance laws/laws governing insurance carriers.

### Sharing and Disclosing Information Gathered

In general, our sites will only collect data from you that will be used to respond to and/or resolve your question, to provide accurate quotes, and to issue policies.

We do track the domain name, IP address, browser type, and referring IP address of our site visitors through a site-reporting tool that runs on our servers and uses cookies. This information is used internally only to show activity and trends of our site usage.

We do not provide your personal information to mailing lists nor do we sell, share or trade your information to unaffiliated parties. From time to time, we may share your email address with third-party vendors to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited to marketing emails and email distribution of surveys. These vendors are not permitted to share your email address with anyone else nor use the information for any other purpose.

From time to time, we may be required to provide your personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law.

### Protecting Information Gathered

IMT uses Secure Socket Layer encryption (SSL) to protect the privacy of your information.

IMT does not control the privacy practices of the companies which we represent; however, all the companies use the information you provide for the purpose of issuing an accurate insurance policy. Quote information is not shared with any of the insurance companies. It is your choice whether to provide personal information to IMT. If you choose to give us the personal information, refer to this privacy statement for an understanding of how that information will be collected, used and/or disclosed or distributed.

You are entitled to access the personal information which we have gathered about you and to request corrections of that information. In order to do so, please direct your request to [customercare @ insuremytrip.com](mailto:customercare@insuremytrip.com) and describe your request or correction.

Please refer to the privacy policy statements of the individual insurance companies for their use of your personal information.

### Updates to the Privacy Policy Statement

We may amend this policy from time to time to keep up with changes in the law or corporate policies. If we make any substantive changes we will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address you have provided us or by posting a prominent announcement on our webpage.

This privacy policy statement was last updated on July 24, 2013.

When you trust us with your personal information, you can be sure that we're managing that trust responsibly. We closely follow industry standards and best practices to ensure that the security of our data won't be compromised.

### User Security

InsureMyTrip uses Secure Socket Layer encryption (SSL) to protect the privacy of your information. Encryption is a way of scrambling a message or a piece of data so that only a person who has the decryption key can view it. By encrypting your personal information, we're able to make sure no unauthorized persons can see what you've shared with us.

### Physical Security

Our data center is monitored 24/7/365. We use digital surveillance equipment to maintain efficient monitoring, and store all customer data exclusively on servers located within the United States.

### Availability

Our servers have redundant internal and external power supplies. By implementing backup power for our servers, we're able to make sure that data isn't lost due to power service issues in severe weather or other unforeseen circumstances.

### Network Security

Network firewalls are used to restrict traffic and access to sensitive information. We also use intrusion detection systems, which prevent access to our data from outside intruders.

### Storage Security

All data is stored on servers located in the United States. We run backups throughout the day and use an offsite storage system for backup. We also encrypt all information in our backup systems to prevent data from being viewed by unauthorized persons.

If you have any questions about our security policies or what we do to protect you, send us a message at [security @ insuremytrip.com](mailto:security@insuremytrip.com).
