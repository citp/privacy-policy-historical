would not tie or link your email address (Personal Information) with  
information collected by a cookie regarding the length of time you

Disclosure to Service Providers and Online Partners for Website  
Operations.  We reserve the right to disclose your Personal

use third parties to process payments, host our servers, provide

analytics, and reporting services.  We will take commercially  
reasonable efforts to cause these third parties to agree to hold your

transfer such  information as part of such merger,  
acquisition, sale, or other change of control.   In  
the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the  
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights  
generally, we reserve the right to transfer such information to protect  
our rights or as required by law.

SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

3rd Party Cookies for Web Analytics and Reporting.  We reserve  
the right to use web analytics services provided by 3rd parties. These  
services use 3rd party cookies (cookies passed by others, not by us) to  
collect Non-Personal about your use of this site.  These web  
analytics services may also transfer this information to third parties  
where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the  
information on the service’s behalf.

3rd Party Cookies for Serving Behavioral Ads.  We reserve the  
right to serve our ads and third party ads on our site that are  
targeted to your interests (“3rd Party Behavioral Ads”).  3rd  
Party Behavioral Ads are served by 3rd party advertising services that  
use 3rd party cookies (cookies passed by others, not by us) to collect  
Non-Personal Information about your use of this site and other  
websites.  This information is your  
â€œbehavioral  
dataâ€.  3rd Party Behavioral Ads do not  
use your Personal Information.  Instead, they associate your  
behavioral data on visited sites with your computer, so that the ads  
your computer sees on this site are more likely to be relevant to your  
interests.  These advertising services may also transfer this  
information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where  
such third parties process the information on the service’s  
behalf.  We will provide notice and the opportunity to opt-out  
of receiving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads.

Network.  We reserve the right to participate in Google’s  
AdSense network for purposes of serving 3rd Party Behavioral

DATA SECURITY

We follow reasonable and appropriate industry standards to protect your  
Personal Information and data.  Unfortunately, no data  
transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be  
guaranteed 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect  
your Personal Information by following generally accepted industry  
standards, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any  
information you transmit to us or archive at this site.

Any Personal Information which we may collect on this site will be  
stored and processed in our servers located only in the United  
States.  By using this site, if you reside outside the United

your country of residence to the United States.

UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION

Upon request, we will permit you to request or make changes or updates  
to your Personal Information for legitimate purposes.  We  
request identification prior to approving such requests.  We  
reserve the right to decline any requests that are unreasonably  
repetitive or systematic, require unreasonable time or effort of our  
technical or administrative personnel, or undermine the privacy rights  
of others.  We reserve the right to permit you to access your  
Personal Information in any account you establish with this site for  
purposes of making your own changes or updates, and in such case,  
instructions for making such changes or updates will be provided where  
necessary.

This site treats email messages and other electronic messages that are

private, except as required by law, including without limitation, the  
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. Sections  
2701-2711 (the “ECPA”).  The ECPA permits this site’s limited  
ability to intercept and/or disclose electronic messages, for example  
(i) as necessary to operate our system or to protect our rights or  
property, (ii) upon legal demand (court orders, warrants, subpoenas),

pertain to the commission of a crime.  This site is not  
considered a “secure communications medium” under the ECPA.

party sponsors for purposes of the mailing; we do the mailing for  
them.  However, if you do accept any of these promotional  
offers, any information that you provide in the process of registration
