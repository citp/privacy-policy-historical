    <h2 id="ourcommitmenttoyourprivacy">Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>We are committed to helping you, our Imikimi customer to</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>share your positive contributions</li>
    
    <li>express yourself creatively</li>
    
    <li>discover and deepen your connection with others</li>
    
    <li>easily and fully control your privacy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We charge you a small fee to make it possible to do those things. We do not sell or share your data with 3rd parties. That makes your privacy and your control over your digital social life SO much easier!</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>You pay us to work for you, our customer.</li>
    
    <li>Other, ad-supported sites get paid by 3rd parties you don’t even know, to package up all of the data of your digital life, for purposes you have little control over. You are not their customer, you are their product.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note: We do work with 3rd party services, but we do so solely for the purpose of serving you. These services include, but are not limited to: data storage, servers, analytics, and contacting you.</p>
    
    <h2 id="youcontrolyourprivacy">You Control Your Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>We invented “Streams” so you could control your sharing and privacy for each group of people you interact with. Your profile picture, your display-name and whether or not you are a 'member' are publicly viewable. The rest of your privacy is controlled Stream-byStream. Currently, there are two kinds of Streams:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Private Streams: By default, private streams are only viewable by you. You can share your private streams with others by sharing one or more posts from that Stream. Whomever you share a post with will be able to see and comment on any post in that same Stream. This allows you to choose, on a Stream-by-Stream basis, who sees your content.</li>
    
    <li>Public Streams: Anybody can see your public Streams.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="deletingandchangingyourcontent">Deleting and Changing Your Content</h2>
    
    <p>You can change your e-mail and your account name on your Profile page. You can delete Posts individually any time your are logged in, under the Stream Settings menu when you are on the Post. When you delete the last Posts in a Stream, the Stream will be automatically deleted as well. You can delete an entire Stream, with all its posts, from the Stream Settings menu.</p>
    
    <p>We are working on tools to help you delete your whole Account more easily. In the mean time, if you wish to delete your account, please contact us directly.</p>
    
    <h2 id="imikimiprivacypolicydetails">Imikimi Privacy Policy Details</h2>

    <p>We may store or process personally identifiable information using third-party companies. We do not share personally identifiable information for any reason. We require that these parties agree to
    process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we
    use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use

    our products.</p>
    
    <p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or
