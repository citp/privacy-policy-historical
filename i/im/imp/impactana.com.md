**Impactana Toolbar**

Together with the online app, our team developed the Impactana toolbar.

The Impactana content marketing toolbar (Alpha Version) is free and easy to use. It provides you with a very powerful set of metrics right in your browser.

You can identify powerful content, new trends and popular authors. For every new page, our toolbar will show you a wide set of Buzz and Impact metrics¹.

**By installing and using the Impactana Toolbar you agree to the following terms and privacy policy:**

To make the Impactana Toolbar features work, the extension collects information about the websites you visit and the date of your visit. Once you enable the Impactana Toolbar, our servers receive the URL²  you currently visit, so we can send you back the Buzz and Impact metrics.

We don’t do this to creep where you surf to and we will not keep  personalized records on your surfing habits longer than necessary. Honestly, we  don’t care where you surf to, but theoretically we would be able to track your  surf behavior with that information.  If you want to avoid us indexing some URLs you surf to, you can easily disable  the toolbar on a domain by domain basis by clicking “Disable toolbar on this  domain”. Then our servers won’t receive any data about your visit to the domains  you disabled the toolbar for. On those domains we won‘t show you the toolbar. This  means you can fine-tune which URLs you want to send to us.

²URL: Uniform Resource Locator: a protocol for specifying addresses on the Internet. An address that identifies a particular file on the Internet, usually consisting of the protocol, as http, followed by the domain name.
