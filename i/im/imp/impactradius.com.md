**Last updated: April 16, 2018**

**We Are Impact**

We are Impact Tech, Inc. (US) (formerly known as “Impact Radius, Inc.”), and the following affiliated companies (“Affiliates”): Impact Radius Limited (UK), Forensiq Limited (UK), Impact Radius SA Pty Ltd (Cape Town, SA), and Impact Radius Pty Ltd (AU).  We, and our Affiliates, are referred to as “Impact”.

Impact (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the website www.impact.com (“Website”) and provides Forensiq, Altitude, and Radius Software-as-a-Service products (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information relating to you that identifies you or by which you are identifiable (“Personal Information”) through the use of our Website, our Services, or that you otherwise provide to us. We will not use or share your Personal Information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Website and Services. By using this website, the Services, or providing Personal Information to us, you agree to our collection and use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Who may use our Website, Services?  
**Although certain areas of the Website can be accessed by visitors generally, access to our Services is not provided to the general public. Only persons or entities that are eligible to enter into further agreement(s) with us (our “Clients”) may, with our permission, access non-public areas of our Website. All such Clients are businesses and only adults may access our Services.

**Personal Information Collection and Use**

Our Clients that use our Services will be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information that can be used to contact or identify them (“Client Personal Information”). Such Client Personal Information will include, but is not limited to, name, postal address, email address, phone number and employer. We collect and use Client Personal Information to:

  * verify your identity;

  * provide Services to our Clients;
  * provide information and otherwise respond to your requests;
  * contact you periodically about other services and products we offer and with information on upcoming Impact events;

  * for any other purposes that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request your Personal Information, and pursuant to your consent.



If you submit information through our website to enquire about our Services, our organization, or an event or information posted on our Website, we will use such Personal Information to contact you in reply to your specific enquiry.  You may be asked at that time whether you would like to be on our mailing list to receive news and updates about our company and Services.  You may request to be removed from such mailing list at any time by using the “unsubscribe” function in our electronic communications or by contacting us as provided in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.

We may also process Personal Information of our Clients’ visitors and customers, and visitors to our Clients’ websites (or our Client’s application downloads) in performance of the Services on behalf of our Clients. This Personal Information may consist of Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, and/or email addresses, although we request that our Clients encrypt email addresses prior to sending to us.  We take security measures to protect all Personal Information, including by hashing IP addresses and further encrypting email addresses. We do not associate Personal Information with individuals and are subject to our Clients’ instructions regarding such collection and use of such Personal Information. As a vendor of our Clients, the bases for our collection and processing of Personal Information of their customers and visitors may be through consent obtained by our Client and/or legitimate interests.

Impact does not rent, sell, or share personal data about you with other people or companies that are not Affiliates, except under the following circumstances:

  * in order to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

  * if Impact sells any or all of its assets or their shareholders sell any or all of their shares to a third party in which case and subject always to compliance with applicable data protection legislation, you authorize that your Personal Information may be transferred to the buyer.
  * In relation to Client Personal Information and in the course of providing our Services, to our other Clients that you have relationships with.



**Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information**

Client Personal Data is accessible through our Client online accounts (“Client Portals”). Clients are able to access their Personal Information to update and correct their Personal Information.  If you no longer have access to the Client Portals, you may submit a request to remove Personal Information you provided to us by emailing a request to privacy@impact.com or contacting us by telephone or mail as further specified in the How to Contact Us clause of this Privacy Policy. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before removing your information.

We reserve the right to retain and use Client Personal Information as reasonably necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you, and in order to comply with applicable laws, including privacy and/or data protection legislation.
