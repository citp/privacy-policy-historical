We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site,

                  <strong>"Personally Identifiable Information"</strong>
                  <br>
refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify,
contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains,
including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number,
email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit
card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include
information that is collected anonymously (that is, without
identification of the individual user) <br>
or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What Personally Identifiable Information is
collected? </strong><br>
We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.
We collect the following additional information from our Authorized
Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of
Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the
nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized
Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What organizations are collecting the
information? </strong><br>
In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party
service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and
banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow
services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized
Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such
information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal
information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers.
Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as
links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the
information given to them.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable
Information?</strong><br>
We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to
make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling
requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers
about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or
information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use
Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized
Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested
information. <span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <a href="http://www.weblawgenerator.com/"><img alt="website legal forms" border="0" height="1" width="1"></a></span><br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>With whom may the information may be shared?</strong><br>
Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be
shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential
transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated
information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our
Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and
third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of
receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting
on our behalf. <br>

Such vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable
Information on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers
for service eligibility. <br>
Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this
information. <br>
Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law.
We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply
with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement
agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally
Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the
safety of our Visitors and Authorized Customers. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How does the Site keep Personally
Identifiable Information secure?</strong><br>
All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and
practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and
Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of
qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access to
the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a
regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or
social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place
to protect information sent over the Internet. While we take
commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic
communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering and
break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not
take place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized
Customers for any such occurrences. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in
Personally Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally
Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by
emailing us at bertuseng@yahoo.com <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally
Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</strong><br>
We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to
delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's
database by contacting bertuseng@yahoo.com. However, because of backups
and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's
entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who
requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will
have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell,
