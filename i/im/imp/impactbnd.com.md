### **9) EU Data Subject Rights**

In certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information:

  * Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information IMPACT holds about you and to check that IMPACT is lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the Personal Information. This enables IMPACT to have any incomplete or inaccurate data held about you corrected, though IMPACT may need to verify the accuracy of the new data provided.
  * Request erasure of Personal Information. This enables you to ask IMPACT to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for IMPACT continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask IMPACT to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where IMPACT may have processed your information unlawfully or where IMPACT is required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that IMPACT may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
  * Object to gathering of your Personal Information where IMPACT is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to gathering on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where IMPACT is gathering your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, IMPACT may demonstrate that it has compelling legitimate grounds to gather your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  * Request restriction of gathering of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask IMPACT to suspend the gathering of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want IMPACT to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where IMPACT’s use of the data is unlawful but you do not want IMPACT to erase it; (c) where you need IMPACT to hold the data even if IMPACT no longer requires it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to IMPACT’s use of your data but IMPACT needs to verify whether it has overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  * Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. IMPACT will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for IMPACT to use or where IMPACT used the information to perform a contract with you.
  * Withdraw consent at any time where IMPACT is relying on consent to gather your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any gathering carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, IMPACT may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. IMPACT will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
