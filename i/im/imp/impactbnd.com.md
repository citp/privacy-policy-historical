When registering for additional inbound marketing information, purchasing a product, or freely entering information on our website, personal data is collected and entered into our system. By means of cookies and various technologies, we then use your information to improve your overall site experience such removing the need to re-enter your information to access hidden content.

After receiving your information, it may then be used to communicate with you regarding your topic of interest, to inform you of new products or services, or other related content depending on the form you submitted. The chance to “opt-out” of e-mail communication is included on all of our registration forms. Collected information may also be used to develop our inbound marketing services through examination, research and analysis. In rare instances, your data may be shared with third parties in order to avoid fraud, adhere to legal processes, and protect our network. Our servers in the United States process all personal information.
