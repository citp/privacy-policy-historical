#### Security and Privacy

##### Identification

During the registration, the system will give each user a personal unique WM-ID - identifier in the system. 

Every user will choose a password that is required to enter the system. Each user will also create an entire path and the names of his private key files. Moreover, a user can provide and edit personal data. Using a WM-ID to identify a member, especially if he or she is a verified certificate holder, is an important component of the WebMoney mechanics. Without a WM-ID and appropriate credentials (key file) it is impossible to enter the system and acquire control of the purses. Without knowing your correspondent’s WM-ID, it is impossible to send a message and a bill, or view his credit history. Private key files mustn’t be given to third parties because they are the property of WM-IDs holders 

Along with identification based on WM-ID, there is authentication system based on secret key file and password. 

WebMoney provides a mechanism to verify a user’s identity. Availability of the [WM Verification Service](http://passport.wmtransfer.com/) with the automated data processing center and geographically wide agent network allows for WebMoney member identity verification based upon presentation of legally valid identification 

WM-identification features can be used not only within WebMoney. You can take advantage of the WebMoney system features that enable you to collect (also automatically), store, and process your client information, reliably identify your website visitors without requiring additional registration and authentication (go to the following web pages: [Webmasters](http://www.wmtransfer.com/pfmasters.shtml) and [Developers)](http://www.wmtransfer.com/pfdevelopers.shtml). 

##### Security

Considering the fact that the transactions are conducted online, WebMoney utilizes a multi-tiered system of protection. WebMoney uses adequate measures of security and protection for your funds. Let’s look at them in detail. 

Without a personal unique twelve-digit WM-ID, private key file and passport, it is impossible to enter the system and acquire control of funds.

The system technology virtually eliminates possibilities of unauthorized access to WM-ID, as well as possibilities of conducting transactions from purses with zero balance. 

All operations in the system including billing operations, transfer of funds, sending and receiving messages, etc, are conducted using a 1024-bit RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm. In addition, when conducting a transaction, the system utilizes unique session keys that prevent same data from being used twice, for example, when someone intercepts your connection and tries to use your data again. 

In case of connection malfunctions, when the system cannot complete the transfer, funds will remain in a sender’s purse. 

In addition to technological mechanisms used by WebMoney there are additional security services described on the website of [Security WebMoney](http://security.wmtransfer.com/). 

##### Privacy

You should not worry about the privacy issue. When you provide us with your personal data, you can be assured that it will only be accessible to the registrars and the Verification Center personnel. No one else, including other members of the system, will have access to any of your private data. Moreover, you can make all information invisible to the public. 

If then, your business partner wants to access your personal data, you can make it visible by using your WM Keeper interface. 

By your WM-ID it is impossible to learn numbers of your purses. You may register multiple WM-IDs if necessary.
