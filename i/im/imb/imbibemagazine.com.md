PRIVACY POLICY

When ordering a magazine subscription or single copy, we may ask you to supply certain personally identifying information, including: your name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, organization or any other identifying information. This information will be shared with logistics partners—with whom we have non-disclosure agreements—for the express purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested/purchased from _Imbibe_ or its affiliates.

Occasionally we may make our customers' names and addresses available to carefully screened companies whose products or services we feel may interest you. If you want to be excluded from such mailings, call us at 877-246-2423, [e-mail us](mailto:subscriptions@imbibemagazine.com?subject=privacy) or mail us a letter requesting that we not share your information with third parties. From time to time, we also offer e-mail updates to customers and other interested parties; however, we will never share your e-mail address with a third party.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect via surveys and site metrics to analyze site usage and improve the design and content of our site and our magazine. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer our website. 

We will disclose information in our database when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.
