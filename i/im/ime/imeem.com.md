# imeem! - Privacy

imeem, inc. operates the imeem service, imeem.com and imeem.net websites and distributes imeem software. The imeem service allows you to connect, communicate and collaborate with your friends across the Internet while enjoying the same privacy and security as a private network. Friends are people you choose to connect with and who agree to connect with you. Of course, friends can be social friends, business associates, classmates, members of your church, or teammates in your softball league. imeem is implemented as a peer network where every computer that a member downloads the imeem client onto is a peer. Peers can cache (i.e. store locally) certain information as described below. 

Your privacy is very important to us. To help you understand how your privacy is protected we provide an explanation of various parts of the system below: By using imeem, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in the Privacy Policy.

Users have the ability to choose who will be able to link, chat, and send notes to them, as well as who can invite them to join meems. Users may also have the option to edit their privacy settings.

## Information gathered by imeem

For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us, imeem requires you to provide your name, email address, and each subscriber has a user ID and password that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis. In addition, imeem may optionally ask you to provide your physical address and other demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation, as well as credit card information for verification purposes. We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or communicate with others through our systems.

imeem uses cookies to administer its website and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example, we may use cookies to count the number of unique computers accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse cookies.

## Profile information

Your user profile contains information about you that you may want to share with others. The list of privacy setting for your profile includes an option "myself" so that no one else will be able to view your profile. Other options allow you to specify how much and how broadly your profile information should be cached and viewable throughout the imeem network or via the web.

Protecting the privacy of your profile is your responsibility: We caution you not to share sensitive information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver's license numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place such information in your profile. We may use profile information for the purposes of providing our services to you, such as to analyze our demographics, or to better personalize our various offerings for users.

Additionally, any information you choose to display on imeem.com, including your profile, will be viewable by the entire Web (open to the world).

## Meems

Meems are topics that can be shared and discussed within the network. In many cases the meems we choose to connect with help define our personality -- hobbies, favorite artists, current events we are passionate about, and organizations we belong to. The creator of a meem may choose to make it open to everyone within the imeem network or to restrict membership to a specific group of people they choose.

## Instant messages

When you communicate with a friend in an instant message we endeavor to authenticate both sides to make sure they are who they say they are. The system is designed to encrypt the messages as they traverse the Internet to your friend, without being cached in the peer network. imeem enables chat participants to store copies of chat transcripts.

## Search

All search results in imeem are personally generated for you based not only on what is popular, but also on what interests you based on your profile, meems you connect to, and what your friends connect to. In an effort to maintain your privacy, search results are produced by an autonomous algorithm that runs directly on your computer as part of the imeem client. Advertising results are also designed to be most relevant to you and be separated from your search results. Search results may link to other locations within the imeem network or websites on the Internet. Data about searches and search results may be maintained by imeem to help in continually improving the service.

## Inviting others and sending notes

If you invite another person to join imeem, we will ask for that person's name and online contact information. We use this information to contact and inform that person that he or she has been invited to download our software. We will send reminders only with your express consent.

Invitations and notes are sent via email on your behalf by imeem. Emails can not benefit from the encrypted imeem network. Use of email in violation of the user agreement will result in account suspension.

## imeem's use of information

The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to provide our software and services to you. For example, even as we endeavor to protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to create a database of user profiles, select advertisements based on your information and for marketing analysis. In addition, we look at technical information to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the imeem.com site, to enhance our products and to provide our service to you.

We may share personally identifiable information about our users with third parties, including: (1) with your consent or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy; (2) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; (3) where required by law; or (4) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to respond to claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public, or to protect the rights or property of imeem or any third party.

In the event of a change of ownership or a direct merger with or acquisition by another entity, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. You have the ability and control to remove or alter your account specific information at any time.

## Third parties

imeem may provide links to third party websites or allow other companies, called third-party ad servers, to display advertisements to users. Ad server companies can write and read their own cookies on your computer, just as if you had requested a web page from their website. imeem is not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited.

## Updating or removing user information

You may choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to us by editing your profile or account information. If you remove your information, it will no longer remain in imeem's active database, though it may continue to persist on back-up media.

## Use by children prohibited

imeem complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

## Changes to our policies

imeem's Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will notify registered users by posting bulletins on the imeem service, by email at the address provided by you, or by posting notice of changes at [http://www.imeem.com/privacy.aspx](https://web.archive.org/web/20061230043847id_/http%3A//www.imeem.com/privacy.aspx). Your use of the website or the imeem Software after the changes constitutes your agreement with regard to information collected from you in the past and in the future.

## Information storage and security

imeem's computers store user account information, and may cache user profile information for backup and synchronization purposes. imeem also maintains peer servers that can provide access to cached information when peers that would otherwise provide it are logged off of the network. imeem employs industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

imeem allows folders to be shared privately with members of the imeem network. Only friends who have been authorized to share a particular folder can see that the folder exists at all, see what objects are inside or access those objects. The objects in the folder remain on your system and are not cached or indexed in any way by the network. The contents of a meem are cached within the network. When photos are shared with friends, they are not uploaded to imeem servers, unless the sharer grants explicit permission to do so. However, friends will be able to cache them. 

The imeem software is designed so that the content you generate within the network (meems, blogs, forums, photo albums, etc.) will each have an associated privacy setting. If the information being created has its own privacy control (i.e. when creating a blog), it is the users responsibility to select the desired privacy setting upon creation. Other items may inherit an existing privacy setting. In this case, it is the user's responsibility to understand the associated privacy setting before creating content to ensure the handling of their information meets their expectations.

Please note that information stored or cached on other users' computers is subject to those users security practices, which are beyond imeem's control. Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected or stored by imeem in a secure manner, we cannot guarantee complete security. Information held by imeem will be maintained for a length of time appropriate to our business needs.
