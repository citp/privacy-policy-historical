<h1 class="bigHeader">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>imeem, inc. operates the imeem service, imeem.com website and distributes imeem software. The imeem service allows you to connect, communicate and collaborate with your friends across the Internet. Friends are people you choose to connect with and who agree to connect with you. Of course, friends can be social friends, business associates, classmates, members of your church, teammates in your softball league or friends you discover on imeem through shared interests.</p>

<p>Your privacy is very important to us. To help you understand how your privacy is protected we provide an explanation of various parts of the system below. By using imeem, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Users have the ability to choose who will be able to connect with them on the imeem service, as well as who can invite them to join groups on imeem.   Users also have the option to edit their privacy settings.</p>

<p>Groups are topics that can be shared and discussed within the network. In many cases the groups we choose to connect with help define our personality -- hobbies, favorite artists, current events we are passionate about, and organizations we belong to. The creator of a group may choose to make it open to everyone within the imeem network or to restrict membership to a specific group of people they choose.</p>

<h2>Information Gathered by imeem</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>User Provided Information</b>: For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us, imeem requires you to provide your email address and birth date.   You will also be required to select a user ID and password. In addition, imeem may optionally ask you to provide your physical address and other demographic information, such as gender, interests or occupation, as well as credit card information for verification purposes. We may collect other personal information from time to time, such as when you provide feedback or comments, or communicate with others through our systems.</li>
	<li><b>Cookies Information</b>: imeem uses cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to administer its website and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example, we may use cookies to count the number of unique computers accessing our website.  imeem uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the imeem service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li>
	<li><b>Log File Information</b>: When you use the imeem service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, content play information, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How imeem Uses Information</h2>

<p>The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to provide our services to you. For example, even as we endeavor to protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to create a database of user profiles, select advertisements based on your information and for marketing analysis.  In addition, we look at technical information to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the imeem.com site, to enhance our products and to provide our service to you.</p>

<p>All search results in imeem are personally generated for you based not only on what is popular, but also on what interests you based on your profile, groups you connect to, and what your friends connect to.   Data about searches and search results may be maintained by imeem to help in continually improving the service.</p>

<p>Invitations and messages are sent via email on your behalf by imeem. If you invite another person to join imeem, we will ask for that person's name and online contact information. We store this information and use it to contact and inform that person that he or she has been invited to join the imeem.com service. We will send reminders only with your express consent.</p>

<p>When you communicate with a friend in an instant message we endeavor to authenticate both sides to make sure they are who they say they are. imeem enables chat participants to store copies of chat transcripts.</p>

<h2>How imeem Protects Information</h2>

<p>imeem's computers store user account information, and may cache user profile information for backup purposes. imeem employs the following industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control:</p>
	
<ul><li>Use of secure connections using SSL to safeguard information when transmitted from your Web browser to the imeem service.</li>
<li>Use of security controls to restrict access to databases housing personally identifying information.</li>
<li>Use of encryption for sensitive personal information, such as email addresses and user names.</li>
<li>Restrict employee access to databases containing personal information and impose confidentiality requirements upon employees who do.</li>
<li>Bind subcontractors with contractual, technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information.</li></ul>


<h2>When imeem Discloses Information</h2>

<p>We may share personally identifiable information about our users with third parties, including: (1) with your consent or following the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out for specific programs or features, or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; (3) as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy; (4) where required by law; or (5) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to respond to claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of imeem or any third party. We also share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous Log File information) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for our service.</p>
<p>In the event of a change of ownership or a direct merger with or acquisition by another entity, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. You have the ability and control to remove or alter your account specific information at any time.</p>


<h2>Third Parties/Advertisers and Your Information</h2>

<p>imeem may provide links to third party websites or allow other companies, called third-party ad servers, to display advertisements to users. Ad server companies can write and read their own cookies on your computer, just as if you had requested a web page from their website. imeem is not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited. For more information about how to “opt-out” of cookies from certain of our ad serving partners, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that information stored or cached on other users' computers is subject to those users security practices, which are beyond imeem's control. Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected or stored by imeem in a secure manner, we cannot guarantee complete security. Information held by imeem will be maintained for a length of time appropriate to our business needs.</p>

<h2>User Options and Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Your user profile contains information about you that you may want to share with others.   Protecting the privacy of your profile is your responsibility. We caution you not to share sensitive information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver's license numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place such information in your profile.</p>

<p>Any information you choose to display on imeem.com, including your profile, will be viewable by the entire Web (i.e., everyone).  For your own safety we caution you not to include home addresses, telephone numbers or any other personal information that could allow strangers to contact you outside of the imeem service.</p>

<p>To maintain privacy it is also important not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Identity theft is a serious concern to all of us.  To help protect yourself against identity theft, please remember that imeem will NEVER ask for your password in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to select the desired privacy setting upon creation. Other items may inherit an existing privacy setting. In this case, it is your responsibility to understand the associated privacy setting before creating content to ensure the handling of your information meets your expectations.</p>

<p>You may choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to us by editing your profile or account information. If you remove your information, it may continue to persist on back-up media.</p>
