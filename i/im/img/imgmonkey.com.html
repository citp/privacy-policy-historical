<center><h2>Privacy policy</h2><br></center>
        	
<h3>1. General</h3><br>

<p>ImgMonkey.com is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit 
ImgMonkey.co or use its services ("Services") as further outlined in this
 policy. As a condition of using the Services of ImgMonkey.com, you agree 
to provide ImgMonkey.com with certain personal information. This 
information includes, but is not limited to: email address and your 
computer's unique IP address (if any), financial information (email 
address used by your Paypal account) and demographic information (e.g., 
zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, purchase history information 
and age as well as IP addresses that are not unique to your computer). 
Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect contact 
information or financial information from children under the age of 13. 
Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may update it from 
time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on Dec 1, 2014. Each 
time you visit ImgMonkey.com, use the Services, or provide us with 
information, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy 
policy at that time. You agree that by using the Site you are expressly 
and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the 
information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as 
described below in this privacy policy.</p><br>



<h3>2. Change to Privacy Policy</h3><br>

<p>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the
 Site or as we incorporate suggestions from our users. If we are going 
to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner 
materially different from that stated at the time we collected the 
information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or 
disclose your information in this new manner. We will also post a 
notification that the Privacy Policy has been amended prominently on our
 Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how 
we might use that information, and under which conditions we will 
disclose it to anyone.</p><br>



<h3>3. How Your Information is Used</h3><br>

<p>We use contact information i.e. your email address to help us 
efficiently perform account tasks (changing passwords, retrieving lost 
passwords), to deliver the services you have requested, to perform 
quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, and to 
contact you in connection with any orders that you have placed with us. 
No other use of your financial information will be made except to 
satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order. 
When you make a purchase through the Site, or register with the Site, 
you will provide us with an email address where we, or these service 
providers, may contact you for the purposes described in this paragraph.</p><br>



<p><b>Contacting You for Offers and Promotions:</b></p><br>

<p>You agree, in consideration for the use of the Services provided by 
ImgMonkey.com, to allow ImgMonkey.com to use your personal information to 
send you marketing and promotional materials. ImgMonkey.co may also send 
you marketing and promotional materials that promote third party 
products. ImgMonkey.com will not rent or sell your personal information 
for use by third parties. These materials may include, but are not 
limited to: newsletters providing you with additional information on how
 to use the Services, and promotional offers for goods and services from
 ImgMonkey.com or third parties.</p><br>



<p><b>Use of Demographic Information:</b></p><br>

<p>ImgMonkey.com may use your demographic information to perform business 
analyses or to tailor the Site and communications to your interests. We 
may share anonymous, aggregated demographic information with advertisers
 and other third parties so that they can tailor their advertisements 
and communications to the appropriate audience. Any time that we are 
allowed under this privacy policy to share your contact information or 
financial information, we may also share your demographic information 
along with it.</p><br>



<h3>4. Disclosure to Governmental Entities</h3><br>

<p>ImgMonkey.com may disclose specific contact information when we 
determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to 
cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the
 interests or safety of ImgMonkey.com or other visitors to the site or 
users of the Services. Also, your contact information may be passed on 
to a third party in the event of a merger, acquisition, consolidation, 
divestiture, or a bankruptcy of ImgMonkey.com.</p><br>



<h3>5. Use of Cookies and Other Site Tracking Data</h3><br>

<p>Cookies : A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's 
hard drive that contains non-personal information. These cookies help to
 give you faster access to pages you have already visited. They also 
allow you to personalize your pages, and optimize your experience at our
 sites. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit 
our sites, which of our web pages they visit, and how long they stay 
there. This information helps us figure out which of our web features 
are highly successful and which sites might need improvement. You can 
disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences 
or options menus in your browser. Most browsers accept cookies 
automatically, but allow you to disable them. Disabling cookies may 
prevent you from properly using the Services or accessing the site.</p><br>



<p><b>Session IDs:</b></p><br>

<p>"Session IDs" allow us to identify a particular user across multiple 
web page requests. This Session ID is maintained within your cookie 
file, where possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if the user's 
internet browser program does not support cookies then ImgMonkey.com will 
place the Session ID in the requested web page. This allows the end user
 to avoid having to continually re-enter certain information such as 
account name and password for every web page request. This Session ID 
expires whenever the user closes their internet browser.</p><br>



<p><b>Web Site Tracking, Reporting:</b></p><br>

<p>Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a
 "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that allow us to gather only 
non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate 
information about visitors to our sites. ImgMonkey.com (through itself or 
third parties) uses this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous 
data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people 
visiting our web sites and, along with other information you provide, 
customize your future visits and improve our web sites. For example, we 
capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software 
(e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the 
user has them turned on or off), and search engine keywords (what key 
words did a visitor use to get to our site). We also record number of 
visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within 
ImgMonkey.com's web sites. Please keep in mind that none of this 
information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute this 
information to internal staff at ImgMonkey.com and to partners that have 
signed confidentiality agreements with us. Any information that we do 
share with partners reflects overall web site or Internet usage trends, 
not individual.</p><br>



<p><b>IP Address:</b></p><br>

<p>Each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP 
address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and
 optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we 
use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic
 information about you.</p><br>

<h3>6. Information from Other Sites</h3><br>

<p>ImgMonkey.com may place links to other web sites operated by other 
parties and from time to time may include information and links to third
 party web sites in our promotional email. Some of these other web sites
 contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property 
that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit 
these other web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our 
brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be 
aware that we do not control these other web sites or these other web 
sites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply 
to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of these other web
 sites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use
 and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it 
were collected on the Site. We encourage you to review their privacy 
policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their 
actions.</p><br>



<h3>7. Information storage</h3><br>

<p>You understand and agree that ImgMonkey.com stores and processes your 
information on computers located in Netherlands, and by providing any 
data to ImgMonkey.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to 
Netherlands. When you a delete a file from your ImgMonkey.com account, no 
link will remain between you and that file. Deleted files may stay 
cached in ImgMonkey.com servers to save bandwidth in case other people 
request them.</p><br>



            
<h3>8. How to Contact Us</h3><br>

<p>If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or 
information that you have submitted to us you can contact us using our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>. <br></p>
