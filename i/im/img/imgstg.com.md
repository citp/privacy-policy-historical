**Data Protection and Privacy Policy – SportsTG**

**INTRODUCTION**

We at Stack Sports and SportsTG (collectively, “Company” or “we” or “us” or “SportsTG”, including SportsTG Pty Ltd (ABN 76 608 341 260) and its wholly owned subsidiary companies in the United Kingdom (SportsTG (UK) Limited (Number 06809213) and in New Zealand (SportsTG Limited (NZBN 9429042499190)) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. Our aim is to continually ensure that data protection is embedded in every aspect of our technologies, with the fullest transparency and notice provided to data subjects, users, clubs, and sports organisations enjoying the benefits and advantages of SportsTG’s solutions.

Please read the following to learn more about how we collect, store, use and disclose information in connection with information collected through all our services including sports management solutions, websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), widgets, competitions, customer surveys and advertising services (collectively, the “Company Services”). In most cases, SportsTG acts as a data processor on behalf of our data controller clients, and we collect and process personal data only at their specific direction and indication. 

SportsTG is bound the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as well by the privacy laws applicable in the UK, New Zealand, and Australia in relation to the collection, storage and handling of your personal information.

**WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?**

This Privacy Policy applies to all persons who interact with us, including those who are registered and unregistered users of Company Services, subscribers to our products or services, and advertisers. This Privacy Policy applies to SportsTG’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e. “personal information”, or information about an identified or reasonably identifiable natural person, such as name and surname, postal address, email, etc.).

The Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information that we gather when our

Company provides various services to data controller sporting organisations, including national governing bodies, state federations, associations, leagues and clubs (“Sporting Organisations”) to assist those Sporting Organisations in administering their sports. The services we provide to Sporting Organisations may include online registration and payments, membership and competition management systems, operating and hosting of systems and websites, data collection and storage services, and other systems developed and/or operated by SportsTG. The collection of information about you by the Sporting Organisation, for example when you register as a member of a Sporting Organisation, and the use and disclosure of that information, is governed by the privacy policies of the relevant Sporting Organisation.

SportsTG, acting as data processor, does not use information collected by Sporting Organisations other than in providing services to the Sporting Organisations. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DOES SPORTSTG COLLECT?**

SportsTG collects the personal information needed to provide Company Services and for our business operations. The following are the main types of personal information collected by SportsTG and the main purposes for which they are collected.

**Registration Information**  is the information you provide to SportsTG in the course of registering for or acquiring a Company Service, for example, to create an account, become a subscriber, make a support inquiry, become an advertiser, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a competition. Registration Information may include, for example, name, delivery or postal address, email address, gender and birthday. Where possible, you may have the option of interacting with us anonymously, for example when browsing our digital products as a casual user.

**Health Information**  may also be collected in connection with registration on behalf of a Sporting Organisation or other client. Health-related information will be limited in scope, and generally will only be collected for insurance-related purposes or other legitimate interests on the part of our Sporting Organisation clients. Your explicit consent is required for the collection and processing of any health-related information. 

**Public Information and Posts**  consist of comments or content that you post to the Company Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, tweets, status, profile information and picture(s). Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines. Public information is collected in order to complete users’ member profiles. We will only collect and use your public personal information and posts after we have received your opt-in consent to do so. 

**Information from third party Social Media.**  If you access or log-in to a Company Service through a third party social media service or connect a Company Service to a third party social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the third party social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address, followers or friends lists, and any information you have disclosed in connection with that social media service. We do not collect your passwords other than in relation to our own services. We will only collect and use your personal information from third party Social Media after we have received your opt-in consent to do so.

**Activity Information – cookies and other technologies.**  When you access and interact with Company Services, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Company Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Company Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information from that device.

Moreover, when you visit websites that we operate or host for Sporting Organisations, SportsTG collects certain de-identified or anonymous information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information, and if you access those websites from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information from that device. SportsTG uses that information as if your access to those websites was a Company Service provided to you. The collection and processing of activity information, including the use of cookies, will be subject to your opt-in consent.

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We use the information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:

**To provide Company Services to you.**  SportsTG will use your information to provide Company Service and features to you including:

  * to measure and improve Services and features. 



Personal information may also be collected in order to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services, for customer service, support and maintenance, surveys, product improvement and client relationship purposes, as well as to enter into contracts with you or third parties. We may also use your information to improve Company Services including through research and data analysis by us and our service providers. Where your information is contained within an advertisement which SportsTG publishes for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the initial publication of the advertisement. Where your personal information is contained in a user generated post we may publish your name and suburb to identify you as the author of the comment if we choose to publish comment in any media. We may use and disclose your personal information in other ways expressly disclosed at the point of collection. If you are a competition winner we may disclose your information to relevant regulatory authorities and publish your details in accordance with the competition terms. We will only use your personal information in this manner after we have received your opt-in consent to do so.

**To allow social sharing functionality.**  If you log in with or connect a social media service account with Company Services, we may share your user name, picture, tweets and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Company Services users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your Company Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy. We will only collect, use, and share your personal information from third party Social Media after we have received your opt-in consent to do so.

Where we share your information with our related companies, they may use your information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Policy.

**HOW DO WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?**

As a data processor, we do not rent or sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share and disclose information (including Personal Information) to third parties in the following limited circumstances:

**To allow service and content providers to assist us in providing and managing the Company Services.**  SportsTG may make your information available to certain third party service and content providers, such as providers of data cloud services, website hosting service providers, direct marketing services, who help us manage or provide the Company Services or provide SportsTG with related services. 

SportsTG shall remain responsible for ensuring that such third party service or content providers processes your Personal Information in accordance with the GDPR and  other applicable privacy laws (see the sections below headed “Additional Information for Users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”)” and “International Data Transfers”). Unless we tell you differently and you consent, our third party service and content providers do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond the specific service they are providing to you and/or SportsTG. 

**To provide co-branded services and features.**  We may offer co-branded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions together with a third party (“Co-Branded Services”). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on Company Services or on the third party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy. We will advise you when this is occurring or obtain your opt-in consent to share your personal information in these circumstances.

**To protect the rights of SportsTG and others.**  There may be instances when SportsTG may disclose your information, including situations where SportsTG has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of SportsTG, our related companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Company Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process in any country; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

**To complete a merger or sale of assets.**  If SportsTG sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, we may transfer or disclose your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction and as part of any due diligence processes which take place in contemplation of a potential transaction.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?**

We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures to protect any information we hold in our records from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  Unfortunately, no company or service can guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Among other practices, your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

Please note that we may still use any de-identified Personal Information that does not identify any individual, and may also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**International Data Transfers**

Personal Information you submit on the Websites or through the Services is sent to Australia and will be primarily processed by us in Australia and potentially in other countries, on our servers or on our hosted service providers’ cloud servers on our behalf. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those in your country of residence. However, we will always protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed. Each affiliate or supplier outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) receiving your Personal Data is bound by  **Standard Contractual Clauses  **that comply with the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to controllers and processors established in third countries set out in the European Commission Decision 2010/87/EU.

**OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR YOU**

**Updates to Privacy Policy.**  SportsTG may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Please look at the Last Updated date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on Company Services. If the changes affect any agreement between us, you will be entitled to terminate our agreement if those changes are not acceptable to you, on reasonable grounds.

**Linked Services.**  The Company Services may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, competitions or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. SportsTG is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Company Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.

**Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service**. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

**Data Retention.**  We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.  
Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or other policies. We do not always completely remove or delete all of your information for a number of reasons including due to technical and systems constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.

**Sensitive Information.**  We ask that you do not send or disclose to us any sensitive personal information (such as information related to racial or ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) that we haven’t specifically requested from you. If, contrary to this request, you do provide any sensitive information, in doing so you consent to us collecting and handling that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Complaint.  **If you think we have breached the privacy laws in your jurisdiction, you may complain to us by contacting our Privacy Officer using the below contract information. When you contact us, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and clearly describe your complaint. We may need to share your information with others who can assist in responding to your complaint. We will respond to your complaint as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 5 business days, by making contact with you to inform you whether we need further information. We will also let you know the next steps in resolving your complaint. If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint, or at any time, you may refer your complaint to the privacy regulator in your jurisdiction, including the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (www.oaic.gov.au), the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (www.ico.org.uk) and New Zealand Privacy Commissioner (www.privacy.org.nz)
