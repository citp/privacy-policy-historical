# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Privacy

IMAX Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “IMAX” or “we”) value your time, respect your privacy, and seek to earn your trust. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (the “Website”).

We collect information about you through the Website in an effort to improve your IMAX experience and to tell you about our products, services, contests and promotions. Your trust is essential to us, and we are not in the business of selling or renting information about our customers to others.

In line with these values, our privacy policy may change from time to time. If it does, we will post an updated policy on the Website and change the “last updated” line above. For this reason, we ask that you check periodically to review our policy for such changes.

If you have any unanswered questions about our privacy policy, click this [info@imax.com](mailto:info@imax.com) to reach our Privacy Officer.

## How does IMAX collect this information?

We receive and store any information from your visits to the Website or that you give us in any other way. 

As is true of most web sites, we gather and store certain information automatically, including IP addresses, browser types, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information does not identify individual users, and is used to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

To do this, we use ‘cookies’ or alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features that improve the performance of the Website for you. If you are concerned about cookies, the “help”, “options” or “preferences” functions on most browsers will allow you to limit or disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of our interactive features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

To ensure we are sending our e-mails to the right address, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities.

Last, to provide customer service, we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive address information from these sources to correct our records and contact you more easily.

We will correct any personal information we store whenever possible and delete stale information on an ongoing basis and are very happy to hear from you to ensure that our information is as complete and accurate as possible.
