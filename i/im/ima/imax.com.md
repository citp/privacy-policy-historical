To do this, we use ‘cookies’ or alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features that improve the performance of the Website for you. If you are concerned about cookies, the “help”, “options” or “preferences” functions on most browsers will allow you to limit or disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of our interactive features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

To ensure we are sending our e-mails to the right address, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities.

Last, to provide customer service, we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive address information from these sources to correct our records and contact you more easily.

We will correct any personal information we store whenever possible and delete stale information on an ongoing basis and are very happy to hear from you to ensure that our information is as complete and accurate as possible.
