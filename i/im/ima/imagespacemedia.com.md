### 2\. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGY

_Overview of the Technology._ Our Clients may use our Technology to deliver digital advertisements and other content that are intended to align with consumers' current interests. This form of advertising, called "Interest Matching", delivers advertisements that are more relevant, interesting, and useful for consumers. Our Clients may also use our Technology for other purposes including to help measure the effectiveness of a campaign or to optimize other campaigns.

_Collection and Use of Information._ Our Technology is designed to facilitate the delivery of contextual and interest-based advertising. We may use our Technology to identify a visitor's interests by gathering web viewing data (e.g., web pages visited, interactions with ads, words or other content displayed in a browser or device) and other non-PII (e.g., browser type, referring URL, Internet service provider, computer's or device’s operating system, and date and time of visits) via cookies and other technologies. We may also collect and use other Non-PII including a data set of keyword interactions, which we may use to provide more relevant advertisements and help manage our advertising campaigns. This data set may include keywords recently displayed on a computer or device, the time and date one of our Client's advertisements was clicked on or displayed, and the web pages viewed after interaction with our Client's advertisements. We may use this information to make inferences about the interests or preferences associated with a particular browser or device. These inferences are used to help make the online advertisements that visitors see more relevant to them. Web viewing data and non-PII is also used for other purposes including ad delivery and reporting, measuring the effectiveness of a campaign, optimizing a campaign, and for operational purposes.

We may combine non-PII with information (e.g., demographic data) provided by other entities to help make our clients' advertising more relevant. Some of these entities that provide data to us participate in self-regulatory programs including the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") program. To learn about the DAA program as well as exercise choice with respect to those entities participating in the DAA program, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/ "About Ads").

Visitors may encounter our Technology when they visit a web site: (1) where one of our Clients has enabled our advertising solution; (2) where Vibrant Media, or one of our Clients, purchases online advertisements; and/or (3) where one of our Clients places a web beacon or similar functioning technology. A consumer may "opt out" of certain practices as explained below. 

_Storage of Non-Personally Identifiable Information._ We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 13 months. After 13 months, we remove the cookie identification number and IP addresses and store it for up to 5 years to maintain financial records as well as for data analytics purposes. For more information about how we use cookies, please visit our Cookie Statement [www.vibrantmedia.com/cookies.asp](http://www.vibrantmedia.com/cookies.asp "Vibrant Cookies page").

### 3\. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties 

_General._ We may at our discretion disclose PII and Non-PII (" **Information** ") to third parties if we believe disclosure is necessary by law, or to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. We also may disclose Information when necessary to comply with a court order, legal process or other legal proceeding. Finally, we may transfer Information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, partial or total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.

_PII._ We may share PII with service providers who provide services for us. These service providers are restricted from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services at our direction.

_Non-PII._ We may share aggregate Non-PII collected by us with third parties for a variety of purposes such as analytics. For example, we may disclose to our Clients that 'blue banner ads' receive more clicks than 'orange banner ads.'

### 4\. CONTROLLING THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION

If you'd like to learn how to opt-out from having Vibrant Media collect and use Non-PII from your computer or device in connection with our Technology for Interest Matching advertising, please [click here](http://intellitxt.com/opt_out/ch_optout.asp "Opting Out from Interest Matching"). When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your browser. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect Non-PII from a particular browser or device to tailor our online advertisement campaigns. You will still receive ads if you opt out from Vibrant, but these ads may be less relevant to you. In addition, we may continue to collect certain data for basic ad serving and other purposes such as counting the number of times a keyword has been clicked or other analytic purposes. Please note that if you delete or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. If you block cookies, your opt-out choice also may not be effectuated.

### 5\. PARTICIPATION IN SELF-REGULATORY PROGRAMS

We support the cross industry, Self-Regulatory Principles as managed by the DAA (" **DAA** ") (for more information [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/ "About Ads")).
