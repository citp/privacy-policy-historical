We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ImageComics.com collects information from our users at several different instances.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Registration</strong><br><br>In order to become a registered user at ImageComics.com, a user must first complete the registration form.

For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback to rejecting cookies is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
