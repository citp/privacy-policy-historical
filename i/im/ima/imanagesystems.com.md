For instance, by registering for IMS newsletters or alerts, you agree to receive the correspondence to which you have subscribed at the e-mail address that you provided at registration. Only IMS or its consultants will contact you using this e-mail address. We will send e-mails to this address related to your registration.

_Information collected via mobile devices_

In connection with our mobile applications, we may use third-party service providers to analyse non-personally identifiable user activity to fix errors, monitor usage, and improve the performance of our mobile applications. For example, we receive reports on some of our mobile applications’ aggregate usage and browsing patterns, including information about the type of device used, pages and articles accessed, and other events occurring within our apps. We also receive reports on certain errors occurring within mobile applications. None of these third-party service providers gathers information in a manner intended to identify any particular user personally.
