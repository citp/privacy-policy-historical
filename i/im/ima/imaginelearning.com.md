Imagine Learning
Privacy Policy
Imagine Learning’s mission is to teach language and literacy to the children of the world.
We are constantly innovating in order to improve the lives of children, and we recognize
our moral and legal responsibility to protect student privacy and ensure data security.
This policy outlines Imagine Learning compliance with federal privacy laws and details
our data stewardship and security practices.
COPPA compliance
The primary users of Imagine Learning are young children. The Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of 13. School officials and
teachers are authorized under COPPA to provide consent on behalf of parents; therefore,
Imagine Learning does not obtain parental consent directly. A teacher or school district
official provides consent for a child under the age of 13 to use Imagine Learning when
they create an Imagine Learning account for that child.
For more information about COPPA, you may visit OnGuard Online.
FERPA compliance
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provides parameters for what is
permissible when sharing student information. Imagine Learning is authorized by schools
and districts under the FERPA “school official” exception to receive and use educational
data to provide educational services. This data has significant educational value; apart
from enabling the creation of accounts with which students access the Imagine Learning
individualized learning path, the data allows teachers to track student growth and
identify students who need intervention. This information is used only for academic
purposes. We do not collect data for collection’s sake, and access is limited and
appropriate. See Data Stewardship for more information about how we use and protect
data we collect.
Data Stewardship
This section provides information about Imagine Learning data stewardship practices
and explains how we collect, use, and maintain student personal information.
Data collection
When a school or district creates a student account, Imagine Learning begins to collect
information about students. Some of the data stored is personally identifiable information
(PII).
Copyright © Imagine Learning, Inc.


The following is a list of data fields that are populated to create a student account.
    •   First name
    •   Last name
    •   Grade level
    •   Language
    •   Student number
    •   Student username
    •   Password
    •   Organization number
    •   SSO ID
As students use Imagine Learning, additional data is collected, including assessment
scores, curriculum progress, student audio recordings, and student responses to writing
prompts.
Imagine Learning also collects some personal information about teachers and
administrators when a school or district creates accounts. This data potentially includes
first and last name, e-mail address, and school or district name.
Data use
Data we collect is used to provide educational services. For example, Imagine Learning
makes audio recordings of a child reading and speaking. The audio recordings are played
back to the child so she hears how she sounds. Teachers listen to the audio files for an
accurate and descriptive measure of student progress. These audio recordings
dramatically increase student reading and language fluency.
Imagine Learning tracks and assesses a student’s development as they progress through
the curriculum. This data is used to generate reports that allow teachers to evaluate
student progress, identify students who need intervention, and discover students that
can be taught together as a group. Imagine Learning does not sell student personal
information, nor do we use or disclose the student information we collect for behavioral
targeting of advertisements to students.
We retain some de-identified data (data we have made anonymous by removing all
personally identifiable information) to conduct statistical research. This research helps us
evaluate the effectiveness of Imagine Learning and improve our product.
Data disclosure and access
Imagine Learning acknowledges the right parents and legal guardians have under FERPA
to review any educational data we collect pertaining to their children. Upon request, and
after verifying identity, we will provide parents and legal guardians access to this data
within 45 days. However, we recommend that parents first contact their child’s school.
PII data collected by Imagine Learning is accessible only to a limited number of Imagine
Learning employees who need the data to perform their job.

Data retention and management
Data maintained by Imagine Learning is protected in a secure environment. See Security
Overview for more information about Imagine Learning security practices.
All PII provided to Imagine Learning will be destroyed upon termination of our
relationship with the school or district, or when it is no longer needed for the purpose for
which it was provided.
Data destruction
Imagine Learning employs United States Office of Education best practice
recommendations for data destruction.
Imagine Learning uses these processes for data destruction:
    •   Data is destroyed within 90 days of termination of a relationship with a school or
        district.
    •   Data is destroyed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
        clear method sanitization that protects against non-invasive data recovery
        techniques.
    •   Sensitive data will not be disposed of using methods (e.g.; file deletion, disk
        formatting, and one-way encryption) that leaves the majority of data intact and
        vulnerable to being retrieved.
    •   The individual who performs the data destruction signs a certification form
        describing the destruction.
    •   Occasionally, non-electronic media used within Imagine Learning may contain PII.
        When these documents are no longer required, the non-electronic media is
        destroyed in a secure manner (most typically using a shredder) that renders it
        safe for disposal or recycling.
Security overview
At Imagine Learning, we are serious about our data stewardship responsibilities. We have
implemented several security measures to protect PII from unauthorized disclosure.
Software security
Imagine Learning has implemented privacy and security practices which are compliant
with FERPA and COPPA; however, to achieve comprehensive protection of student PII, it
is necessary for each school or district to use secure practices as well.
        Data encryption
        Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
        File Transfer Protocol
        Data is securely transferred to Imagine Learning using File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
        over secure (SSL/TLS) cryptographic protocol.

        Firewalls
        Anti-virus software and firewalls are installed and configured to scan our system.
        The firewall is periodically updated and configured so users cannot disable the
        scans.
        Security audits
        Imagine Learning conducts security audits and code reviews, both by outside
        providers and by executive summary.
        Secure programming practices
        Imagine Learning software developers are aware of secure programming practices
        and strive to avoid introducing errors in our application (like those identified by
        OWASP and SANS) that could lead to security breaches.
        Account protection
        Each user of Imagine Learning is required to create an account with a unique
        account name and password. Single Sign-On (SSO) users are authenticated with
        secure tokens.
Facility security
Imagine Learning is located inside the continental United States. Physical access is
protected by electronic access devices, with monitored security and fire/smoke alarm
systems.
Employee compliance with security procedures
Imagine Learning has designated a chief security officer to oversee employee security
training and compliance. The chief security officer also oversees the storage and
destruction of sensitive data.
Changes to our privacy policies
Imagine Learning periodically reviews the processes and procedures described in this
document to verify that we act in compliance with this policy. If we determine that a
change is necessary to improve our privacy practices, we may amend this policy.
Changes will be posted 30 days prior to their implementation.
Privacy policy effective: January 1, 2015
Policy last updated: January 23, 2015
