Our websites also use cookies and web beacons.

### International Data Transfers

We have our headquarters in the United States and we also have a presence in Canada, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, Australia and India. Personal information we collect from you will be primarily processed in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the EEA. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which any member of the iManage companies has operations for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will ensure that an adequate level of protection is provided for the information by using one or more of the following approaches:

### Data subject rights

Under data protection laws, you have various rights, such as the right of access, that gives you the right to ask us for copies of any of your personal information that is in our possession; the right to rectification that allows you to rectify and complete information that you think is inaccurate or incomplete; and the right to erasure that gives you the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. You also have the right to restriction of processing, to object to processing and to data portability.

These rights available to you may depend on our reason for processing your information and the circumstances. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights, unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We will respond to any legitimate requests within one month. In the event that your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or if we are not in a position to identify you, we are entitled to refuse to act on your request.

### Security of your personal information

To help protect the privacy of personal information you transmit to us, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that personal information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your personal information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees’ privacy responsibilities.

### Children’s privacy

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [privacy@imanage.com](mailto:privacy@imanage.com).

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here, with an updated revision date. If we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy that materially alter our privacy practices, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on our corporate website and/or social media pages prior to the changes taking effect. Your continued use of our websites or services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates. This Privacy Policy was last updated in August 2019 (with previous edits in May 2019 and May 2018).
