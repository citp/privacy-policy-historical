This means your credit card number is scrambled during the transaction process, so that the information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information in the interest of improving our site and service.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a unique identifier collected by the site to verify a return visitor’s identity, or to understand how visitors navigate the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept the cookie.

A “cookie” does not tell us who you are, your email address, or any other personal information. We use the information it provides to help us improve the site and our service, and to provide our visitors with a better experience, while on the site.

For example, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to view your orders on-line, store or update your user profile, or take advantage of promotional discounts.

Some of our business partners who provide services associated with our site, like banner advertising or email promotions, may use cookies. Since these partners set and read cookies using their own servers, we have no access to, or control over them. However, cookies do not permit access to confidential personal information about site visitors; rather they are used to keep track of traffic to the site.
