ImageComics.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ImageComics.com collects information from our users at several different instances. 

 **Registration**

In order to become a registered user at ImageComics.com, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to provide a valid e-mail address and to create a username. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. All other information, is optional, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized user experience. 

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on ImageComics.com. Once the user closes his or her browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback to rejecting cookies is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site through their banner advertisements and through their affiliate links. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

 **Log Files**

ImageComics.com uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

 **Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

When ImageComics.com partners with another party to provide specific services, and a user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

 **Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ImageComics.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by ImageComics.com. 

 **Surveys & Contests**

From time to time, ImageComics.com requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice as to whether or not he or she will disclose personal information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of ImageComics.com. 

 **Special Offers**

ImageComics.com sends all new members a welcome e-mail to verify password and username. Only members who opt to receive such correspondence will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and/or a newsletter. ImageComics.com always offers members the ability to opt-out of correspondence. Please see our choice and opt-out guidelines below. 

 **Site and Service Updates**

ImageComics.com also sends registered users site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their membership via e-mail. 

 **Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a registered user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a registered user wants to terminate his or her membership, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove that user's personal information from our database. This can usually be done at the member information page or by e-mailing us at info@imagecomics.com. 

 **Choice/Opt-out**

ImageComics.com's users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to ImageComics.com at the point at which we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by e-mailing us at info@imagecomics.com. 

ImageComics.com users are always notified when their information is being collected by outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. 

 **Membership Cancellation**

Image does enforce a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of members who are repeat infringers. If you believe that a member is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact Image and provide information sufficient for us to verify that the member is a repeat infringer. 

 **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
