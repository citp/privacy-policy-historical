**Security**

IMN maintains reasonable precautions designed to ensure the security of personal information covered by this Policy, and to protect such personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, alteration, destruction or disclosure. IMN has a written Information Security Policy and Data Protection Procedures by which data security is to be maintained. Although IMN makes every effort to ensure security of its customer information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

**Data Integrity**

**INFORMATION RECEIVED OR USED BY IMN ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS**

**Notice of Information Received and Stored by IMN on behalf of IMN's Customers**

IMN's services allow IMN's customers to send email communications to their customers ("end-customers"). In order for these services to be delivered, IMN's customers upload certain personal information about their end-customers to IMN's servers. Such information includes email addresses, and may also include other information such as names and physical addresses of the end-customers to whom the email communications will be sent. IMN does not control the categories of information that an IMN customer may choose to upload to IMN's servers. IMN stores this information on its servers on behalf of its customers, and acts merely as a data processor with respect to this data. This information is controlled by the IMN customer on whose behalf the information is stored.

IMN uses personal information about end-customers stored by IMN customers solely for the purposes of delivering services to IMN customers. This includes sending email communications to the end-customers and providing analytical reports to IMN customers relating to IMN services. IMN uses web tracking technologies to track the online behavior of end-customers as they interact with the electronic marketing materials sent on IMN customers' behalf. IMN associates such online behavior with personal information and provides this data to the applicable IMN customer; for example, if an end-customer clicks on a particular product featured in an email communication sent by IMN, the IMN customer may receive a report from IMN identifying the product interest of its end-customer. End-customer behavior data can also be shared for usage by IMN email campaigns and affiliate services if the IMN customer has enrolled in those services.

Because information held on behalf of IMN customers is controlled by IMN customers, IMN cannot delete or modify that information. If you wish to opt-out with respect to information stored or used by IMN customers, you should contact the applicable IMN customer directly.

**Disclosure of Information stored by IMN on behalf of IMN's customers**

IMN does not disclose any end-customer personal information stored on behalf of its customers to any third party except to a) the IMN customer on whose behalf the information is stored, b) to third parties that the IMN customer has agreed, in writing, may receive such information, and c) to IMN subcontractors performing services on behalf of IMN. Any subcontractor to whom personal information is disclosed is subject to written agreements of confidentiality. Any subcontractor that receives any personal information of individuals resident in the European Union upholds the terms, conditions, and principles of this policy. Information stored on behalf of any IMN customer is under the control of the applicable IMN customer.

**Security**

IMN maintains reasonable precautions designed to ensure the security of end-customer personal information covered by this Policy, and to protect such personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, alteration, destruction or disclosure. IMN has a written Information Security Policy and Data Protection Procedures by which data security is to be maintained. Although we make every effort to ensure security of end-customer information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. IMN Customer accounts are password-protected so that only IMN or the applicable IMN customer has access to personal information of end-customers. It is incumbent on the IMN customer not to divulge their password to anyone. IMN will never ask for a customer's password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.

**Data Integrity**

IMN is not responsible for the data integrity of data held by IMN on behalf of IMN customers, because IMN acts solely as a data processor for such customers.

**Access**

IMN cannot offer end-customers access to information stored by IMN on behalf of its customers. Such information is under the control of the relevant IMN customer, and you should contact that IMN customer if you wish to obtain access to any personal information about you which is held by them.

**SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES**

In order to utilize certain IMN services, you will need to permit IMN applications to access your accounts with social media websites and services that are owned and/or controlled by third parties (including, without limitation, Facebook, and Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest) (such Websites and services, collectively, the "Social Media Services"). IMN applications require access to your accounts with Social Media Services in order to post content and provide reporting data. When you elect to permit the IMN services to have access to your accounts with the Social Media Services, you will be authorizing the sharing of your information (which will include personal information if you elect to share such information) with those Social Media Services. It is important to note that the information that you share with the Social Media Services will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the providers of such Social Media Services and not by IMN policies and agreements. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities, including IMN. When you authorize the IMN service to exchange information with the Social Media Services we will collect relevant information necessary to enable our website and service to access that Social Media Service, however you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to IMN). As part of such integration, the Social Media Service will provide IMN with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of the applicable Social Media Services provider, and, as a result, IMN shall not have liability nor any responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the IMN website(s) and/or services. In addition, from time to time, our customers may offer certain contests, promotions and other offerings that will be integrated with various Social Media Services. In order to participate in these contests, promotions and other offerings, you will need to opt-in to share your Social Media Services contact information with our customers and their service providers.
