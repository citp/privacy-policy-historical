for such virtual goods, the profit you make by selling such virtual goods
(collectively, "Transactional Data"). We may link this aggregate

record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Site. We do not link the

<h2 id="share-pii">How Do We Share Your PII?</h2>

<p>IMVU
does not sell, share, rent, or trade your personal information with third
parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We
reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law and when we believe
that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a
judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or on our Site.</p>

<p>IMVU
may also report to law enforcement or other appropriate government authorities
any actions that may be suspicious or illegal, and any reports it receives of
such conduct and in conjunction with such report, may disclose your PII to law
enforcement or other appropriate government authorities. When legally required
or at IMVU's discretion, IMVU will disclose your PII and may cooperate with law
enforcement or appropriate government agencies in any investigation. </p>

<p>We may
transfer your PII to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other
corporate reorganization in which IMVU participates or to a purchaser of all or
substantially all of IMVU's assets to which this Site relates. You will be
notified via prominent notice on our Site for 30 days of any such change in
ownership or control of your PII.</p>

<p>Additionally,
if you "opt-in", we may provide your PII to certain companies with
which we have a relationship to allow them to send you targeted offers and
pre-populate offers that they believe you may be interested in receiving.</p>

<p>We use
other third party service providers such as a credit card processing company to
bill you for goods and services or an email service provider to send out emails
on our behalf and we will provide your PII to such service providers so that
they can assist us in providing our service to you. These third parties are
contractually prohibited from using your PII for their own promotional
purposes.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-ads">Third Party Advertisements</h2>

<p>Certain
advertisements that appear on this Site are sometimes delivered (or
"served") directly to users by third party advertisers. Some of these
third party advertisers automatically receive certain of your PII through your
interaction with an advertisement. These third party advertisers may also
download non-personally identifiable cookies to your computer, or use other
technologies such as "web beacons" to measure the effectiveness of
their ads and to personalize advertising content. Their use of your PII will be
governed by the terms of their privacy policies and their privacy policies may
explain the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by
their advertisements.</p>

<p>For
more information about online advertising, please visit the Digital Advertising
Alliance webpage at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/</a>.
Additionally, certain third party advertisers may adhere to the Network
Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Principles. You may learn more about
the NAI Principles and opt-out of receiving targeted ad programs certain third
party advertisers provide at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="third-party-offsers">Third Party Offers</h2>

<p>If you
wish to complete a third party offer in order to earn free credits on the Site
you will be redirected to the third party site for the offer you wish to
complete. The information collected on these third party sites is not covered
by our Privacy Policy, for third party offer sites collection and use of your
information please read their privacy policies. These third party sites share with
us your name and email address once the offer has been completed so that we may
credit your account with the credits you have earned for completing that offer.</p>

<h2 id="co-branded">Co-branded sites</h2>

<p>Some
pages may have the look and feel of our Site (i.e. www.imvu.com), however the
these pages are served by a third party and information collected on these
pages is not covered under our Privacy Policy. For example, all information
collected on www.jobscore.com is owned and controlled by that company's Privacy
Policy.</p>

<p>At
times we may enter into other co-branded relationships. When we enter into
these types of relationships we will share your name and email address in order
for our co-branded partner(s) to provide you with a better experience, to
deliver our products or services, or to allow you to apply for a job.</p>

<p>Our
Privacy Policy does not apply to the information collected on these co-branded
sites. You should read the privacy policy or statement of our co-branded
partner on the co-branded site.</p>

<h2 id="connect">Facebook Connect</h2>

<p>The
Site allows users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to
share on Facebook. If you are already logged into the Site and Facebook, when
you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to merge
your profiles. If you are already logged into Site but not logged into
Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be
prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for
Facebook." By proceeding, you are allowing the Site to access your
information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of
the Site. Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a Site user and
you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to
enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and
join Site. Once you register on the Site and Connect with Facebook, you will be
able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook. You have the
option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into "Account
Settings" and clicking on "Manage OpenID auto-signins." Further,
you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or
disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.</p>

<h2 id="pii-secured">How is your PII retained &amp; secured?</h2>

<p>We
employ procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to
help protect your PII from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or
destruction. IMVU may use firewalls, password protection, secure socket layer,
database encryption, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized
access to your PII.</p>

<p>The
security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter
sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we
encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<h2 id="eu-notice">Notice to European Users</h2>

<p>The
information you enter on this Site or otherwise provide to IMVU may be
transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America and
other jurisdictions which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to
that required in the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the
United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies
on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article
26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995
O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union
to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the
transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of
protection. By agreeing to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, you
consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America
which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the
European Union and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers
located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="update-pii">Correction/Updating PII</h2>

<p>IMVU
provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete the PII that you
have provided to us in your account. If you wish to review or correct any
information you have provided to us, you may access your account and review,
correct, and/or delete your PII by logging into your account and selecting
"Account Settings".</p>

<h2 id="children">IMVU and Children</h2>

<p>IMVU
recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and
guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and
interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. IMVU
does not target its services or this Site to children under 13. IMVU does not
knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13.</p>
