When you come to our website, we will only use the information described above to improve our website and will not store it with any other information that we could use to identify you.

**Links**  
Our website contains links to other sites. Although the IMD logo and references to IMD may appear on some third party websites, please be aware that we, IMD, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our website. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

**Security**  
Our website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit personal information via the website, their information is protected both online and offline. For example, when our registration form asks users to enter personal information, that information is protected during transmission by an industry-standard high level of encryption - 128-bit SSL. You can examine our security certificate and learn more about this security from our security provider.

While we use SSL encryption to protect personal information online, we also take precautions to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the personal information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. In addition, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

**IMD Web Community Membership**  
Joining the IMD Web Community is optional. Membership in the IMD Web Community is automatically provided for participants in IMD programs. You may also choose to join the IMD web community independently. If you choose to register, we will ask you for the following minimum required information:

\- Your name and email address so that we can allow you to access IMD Web Community members-only areas of the website;  
\- A unique login and password to help keep your information secure, which you can use to update your information at any time in the future

We do not sell, rent, or otherwise make available to third parties any personal information for marketing purposes. IMD does on occasion partner with third party organizations and individuals to deliver small portions of IMD programs and services. We share your personal information with these parties, to the extent necessary, and for the sole purpose of delivering IMD programs and services.

We reserve the right to disclose information to local, regional, national or international authorities when required to do so in connection with legal or regulatory proceedings.

**Learning@IMD (IMD program web pages)**  
You may be eligible to access online program materials and services provided as part of an IMD program via your registration in an IMD program. In this case, you may be provided with the option of completing an online profile. The personal information you may provide in this profile is available to your fellow program members as well as IMD faculty and staff associated with the program. We encourage you to complete this profile information to facilitate contact between program participants.

IMD unifies the personal data that it collects by connecting different registration databases. Therefore, registration in an IMD program also provides you with IMD web community membership.
