### Website Security Policy

iModules Software treats the security of its client’s data with utmost importance. We take many precautions at the infrastructure and software layers to deliver the highest level of protection for your constituent data and sensitive information. iModules owns and operates the database and Web servers that host clients' websites and store their data. These servers are protected by securely configured firewalls that prevent data from being accessed via the Internet. Each client's data is stored in a dedicated database; this prevents the intrusion or corruption of data. In addition, clients' data catalogs cannot see or access each other's data.

**SSL**  
Login, electronic commerce, and administrative activity is transmitted over an industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

**Logins and Passwords**  
Strong passwords are required for each login, and they are stored in a salted, hashed format that cannot be read by administrators or employees. Multiple failed logins or lost login requests are challenged by reCaptcha. An administrative rights system restricts authenticated but unauthorized access to constituent data.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**  
The collection, storage, or display of Personally Identifiable Information is discouraged. Social security numbers and driver license numbers are disallowed from being stored. All birthdate data values are stored in an encrypted state.

**PCI Compliance**  
iModules maintains compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and is certified compliant as a Level One Service Provider by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council. iModules' processes, procedures, network configuration, and overall environment conform to all of the security guidelines as defined in the PCI DSS standard and are verified by a yearly third party audit. This Level One compliance, the highest level of PCI DSS compliance, ensures that your e-commerce transaction data is securely protected, transmitted, and stored by iModules.

**Platform Architecture**  
iModules delivers Software as a Service (SaaS) technology developed on the Microsoft® .NET Framework with Microsoft® SQL Server® database server technology. Using the SaaS model, iModules hosts its technology securely online, so our clients do not have to deal with day-to-day hardware, software, and operating-system maintenance. This model provides our clients with faster, up-to-date, reliable technology; protection of sensitive data; valuable software enhancements and automatic product updates; and instant access to online training and support. In addition, clients do not have to worry about additional costs for upgrades or downtime, nor the risk of lost data due to onsite network problems or power outages.

**Email Practices**  
iModules is accredited by the Return Path Certified SenderTM program, increasing our email delivery rates to more than 35,000 domains. The Certified SenderTM program is the largest, most comprehensive "whitelisting" service on the Internet and the leading complete solution for identifying legitimate email. In addition, iModules monitors the latest legislation and regulations to ensure your emails comply, and email templates are designed and tested to ensure deliverability for HTML and text in various email environments.
