2\. Collection of personal data through Online Services**

We collect information you provide directly to us, including when you sign-up to our newsletter, download a guide or brochure, communicate with us, request customer support, send us an email or otherwise interact with us. The types of information we may collect about you includes your name, email address and any other information you provide or if we receive your information as a referral from a partner company. Our legal basis for this processing is either your consent in accordance with art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or our legitimate interest in accordance with art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR since you enter our Online Services voluntarily or otherwise express interest in iMotions, e.g. when you hand us your business card, join a product demonstration, or send us an unsolicited email.

When you access or use our Online Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:

  * Log Information: we log information about your use of our Online Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
  * Device information: we collect information about the device you use to access our Online Services, including information about the device’s software and hardware, Media Access Control (MAC) address and other unique device identifiers, device token, mobile network information and time zone.
  * Usage information: we collect information relating to your use of our Online Services, including which applications you use
  * Information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies: we use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Reference is made to section 8.



We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Online Services.

**  
3\. Collection of personal data through Products**

When you buy and/or subscribe to one of our Products we may collect and process your contact details and professional information. Our legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in being able to deliver the Product you have purchased and/or subscribed to in accordance with art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, as well as the performance of the contract in accordance with art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR.

If you are a test person, we will always collect your consent in accordance with art. 6(1)(a) and 9(2)(a) of the GDPR before processing your personal data. This is due to the given circumstances involving the processing of biometric data for the analysis of test results.

During the performance of our Products at the premises of our clients it may occur that the personal data of other people – not taking part in the Product and survey in question (“third party person”) – is unintentionally processed, e.g. during a mobile eye-tracking study. We will in such cases blur the faces and redact any other identifiable elements of the third-party persons in question, immediately after the recording has taken place – thus rendering the characteristics unidentifiable. Our processing therefore relies on the legitimate interest as legal basis in accordance with art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. We will in any case install a specific and visible sign at the entrance of the client’s premises during the performance of any such Products, whereas any third-party will be informed of the processing activities in question in accordance with art. 14 of the GDPR.

You are of course always welcome to contact us (see details in section 1) should you have any questions.

When you purchase iMotions Learn through our website, your payment information is stored in our website host’s database (WooCommerce plugin hosted on WordPress).
