<h3>Credit Card information</h3>

<p>In general, sensitive data on the credit card such as credit card numbers and card verification codes are never stored on our server.  Only the last 4 digits of the credit card number are kept for reference.  </p>
	
<p>In the premium edition, we can use Imonggo to process your customers' credit card payments. When you enable this feature, we automatically enable the SSL feature as well. This means that we use industry standard 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) software to encrypt all of the data sent to us so that only your web browser and the Imonggo server can decipher them.
Likewise, sensitive data such as credit card numbers and card verification codes of your customers' credit cards are never kept on the server, so there is no chance of them being misappropriated.</p>
