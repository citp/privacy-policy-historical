<p>By using Imonggo.com, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. You should know:</p>

<ol>
<li>We collect limited account – store information and maintain your account data our secure servers. </li>

<h3>Types of information collected</h3>

<p><i>Account-Store information.</i> When you register with Imonggo.com, we will request your full name, email address, store name, company name and a login name and personal password.  This data is needed to create your Store – account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted form.</p>

<p><i>Store Product, Sales and Inventory transaction data.</i> The contents of your Imonggo.com account are stored and maintained on Imonggo.com servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of your store data may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. Imonggo.com employees do not access the content of any task lists unless you specifically request them to do so (normally for technical support reasons) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect Imonggo.com or the public.</p>

<p>We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of Imonggo.com. Information displayed or clicked on in your Imonggo.com account is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Imonggo.com user interface.</p>

</p>

<h3>Credit Card information</h3>

<p>In general, sensitive data on the credit card such as credit card numbers and card verification codes are never stored on our server.  Only the last 4 digits of the credit card number are kept for reference.  </p>
	
<p>In the premium edition, we can use Imonggo to process your customers' credit card payments. When you enable this feature, we automatically enable the SSL feature as well. This means that we use industry standard 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) software to encrypt all of the data sent to us so that only your web browser and the Imonggo server can decipher them.
Likewise, sensitive data such as credit card numbers and card verification codes of your customers' credit cards are never kept on the server, so there is no chance of them being misappropriated.</p>

<p>Imonggo.com may send you information related to your Imonggo.com Store - account or Imonggo.com services. Because such information is important accepting such information is a precondition to using our services.</p>
