# Privacy Policy - PHP Encoder, protection, installer and performance tools from ionCube

### PRIVACY POLICY FOR IONCUBE.COM

As providers of the ionCube.com Online PHP Encoding Service, the ionCube website, community forum, support helpdesk, members' area, and other facilities that may be made available from time to time, collectively termed the "Service", we regard the privacy of our members data as crucial to all concerned, and this statement reflects our sincere commitment to providing a secure and safe Service and environment for every member.

### INFORMATION GATHERING AND USE

The Service gathers and keeps only the minimal information as is necessary to provide a reasonable and satisfactory service. Members' information will not be imparted in any form whether for profit or otherwise in ways different from those disclosed in this statement. Currently this means that the information is not disclosed to anyone. We may use the contact information you supply through the Service at ioncube.com and ioncube24.com to contact you with pertinent information relating to your account, usage of the Service or with relevant marketing information.

### INFORMATION FOR ONLINE PURCHASES

For your security, information gathered and processed for effecting a purchase is handled on a secure server by third parties specialising in payment processing. Processing information is passed back to the Service for the purposes of order matching, however no information is returned concerning account details of credit or debit cards.

### THE USE OF COOKIES

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a visitor's computer containing information sent from the Service. It is passed to the Service when the user requests pages. The Service uses a cookie to establish and authenticate a private session between a member and the Service. Cookies cannot be used to obtain any information from the users computer other than that which was stored in the cookie by the Service in the first place. The cookie is invalidated and may be deleted by the member's browser when the member elects to log out of the Service. For more details, see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180513010824id_/http%3A//www.ioncube.com/cookies_policy.php).

### TRANSACTION AND LOG FILES

Web server log files are kept for the purpose of analysing patterns of usage, and to detect problems with the Service. Log files contain the IP address of the user. The IP address is not currently used for any purposes, but can be informational in providing broad demographic information. Transaction logs are kept for the purpose of detecting site problems and to assist in effecting an accurate restoration of state in the event of site failure.

### LINKS

Whilst the site may contain links to other sites and services, the Service is not responsible for nor endorses any such sites or services, and such sites may very well have privacy policies and practices different to those of ionCube.com. Members are encouraged to review and be aware of any such policies in effect by other sites.

### SECURITY

In particular because using the Service requires a member to disclose the very code that is desired to be protected, we take protection of this information very seriously. We provide a 128 bit strong encryption server for access to the members area, which encrypts transactions from and including the member login, file uploads, and viewing of file archive contents and encoded jobs. We are looking to also support PGP encrypted files.

The site stores source code in a secure area that is unique to each member, and in a way that prohibits access in or out during encoding and archive unbundling. Source files are kept purely for the purpose of encoding, and once encoded, whether successfully or unsuccessfully, source files are removed. Despite being tested, this process will be monitored to ensure that no unforseen event occurred that caused the removal process to fail. In the event that it did, we will investigate this thoroughly until the cause can be identified and resolved.

### TRACKING and MONITORING

ionCube works with third parties for the purposes of fault detection, performance measurement, targeted information based on users' interests and conversion tracking. Third party services and interest-based advertising can sometimes be opted out of through the Do Not Track functionality of the web browser (if provided). Twitter promotions may be run from time to time, and can be opted out of as described [here](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405).
