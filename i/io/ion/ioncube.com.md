PRIVACY POLICY FOR IONCUBE.COM 

As providers of the ionCube.com Online PHP Encoding Service, the "Service", we regard the privacy of our members data as crucial to all concerned, and this statement reflects our sincere commitment to providing a secure and safe service and environment for every member. 

INFORMATION GATHERING AND USE 

The Service gathers and keeps only the minimal information as is necessary to provide a reasonable and satisfactory service. Members information will not be imparted in any form whether for profit or otherwise in ways different from those which are disclosed in this statement. Currently this means that the information is not disclosed to anyone. 

INFORMATION FOR PURCHASE OF CREDITS 

For your security, information gathered and processed for effecting the purchase of credits is handled on a secure server by a trusted company whose proven business is performing such transactions. Contact information is passed back to the Service for the purposes of order matching and contacting you in the event it is necessary in relation to a particular order, however no information is returned concerning account details of credit or debit cards. 

THE USE OF COOKIES 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the members computer containing information sent from the Service, and it's passed to the Service when the user requests pages. The Service uses a cookie to establish and authenticate a private session between a member and the Service. Cookies cannot be used to obtain any information from the users computer other than that which was stored in the cookie by the Service in the first place. The cookie is invalidated and may be deleted by the members browser when the member elects to log out of the Service. 

TRANSACTION AND LOG FILES 

Web server log files are kept for the purpose of analysing patterns of usage, and to detect problems with the Service. Log files contain the IP address of the user. The IP address is not currently used for any purposes, but can be informational in providing broad demographic information. Transaction logs are kept for the purpose of detecting site problems and to assist in effecting an accurate restoration of state in the event of site failure. 

LINKS 

Whilst the site may contain links to other sites and services, the Service is not responsible for nor endorses any such sites or services, and such sites may very well have privacy policies and practices different to those of ionCube.com. Members are encouraged to review and be aware of any such policies in effect by other sites. 

SECURITY 

In particular because using the Service requires a member to disclose the very code that is desired to be protected, we take protection of this information very seriously. We provide a 128 bit strong encryption server for access to the members area, which encrypts transactions from and including the member login, file uploads, and viewing of file archive contents and encoded jobs. We are looking to also support PGP encrypted files. 

The site stores source code in a secure area that is unique to each member, and in a way that prohibits access in or out during encoding and archive unbundling. Source files are kept purely for the purpose of encoding, and once encoded, whether successfully or unsuccessfully, source files are removed. Despite being tested, this process will be monitored to ensure that no unforseen event occurred that caused the removal process to fail. In the event that it did, we will investigate this thoroughly until the cause can be identified and resolved. 

As stated above, secure credit card processing is performed by a third party who specialise in such transactions, and who use 128 bit encryption on an SSL server. In testing we have noticed that the latest Opera browsers on at least Linux incorrectly report that the checkout page is unsecured. This is incorrect, and is a bug in Opera that we have reported, although to which we have received no feedback. Rest assured that the page is secure, as shown by other browsers, and that refreshing the page with Opera then correctly shows the page to be secure, and can be done before any sensitive information is passed for processing.
