In most cases, these credentials means you can use the same credentials to sign in to many different IObit sites and services, as well as those of select IObit partners. By signing in on one IObit site or service, you may be automatically signed into other IObit sites and services. If you access our services via a mobile phone, you may also use your telephone number and a PIN as an alternative credential to your username and password. As part of creating your credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate email address. Some services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. Finally, a unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials which will be used to identify your credentials and associated information. </font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">At some IObit sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, that is used to create a IObit billing account.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with IObit sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with IObit, information collected through one IObit service may be combined with information obtained through other IObit services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Use of Your Personal Information</font></span></b></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">IObit collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some IObit services, such as IObit Newsletter, may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from IObit and its affiliates. </font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Personal information collected on IObit sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which IObit or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a IObit site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. IObit abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Sharing of Your Personal Information</font></span></b></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of IObit and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some IObit sites allow you to choose to share your personal information with select IObit partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers. Other sites do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from IObit on behalf of external business partners about a partner's particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the third party). </font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Some IObit services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.

Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on IObit; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of IObit (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of IObit services or members of the public.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Accessing Your Personal Information</font></span></b></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information online.

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</font></span></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</font></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">IObit cares about children and understand that they have special privacy needs.

However, we allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on IObit Web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. IObit does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Controlling "Spam" or Unsolicited E-mail</font></span></b></p><p style="line-height: 14.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">IObit is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." IObit has a strict Anti-Spam Policy prohibiting the use of customer account to send spam. IObit will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While IObit continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using tools such as the Inbox Protector and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive.</font></span></p><p class="f"><font face="Arial"><b><span lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Enforcement</font></span></b><span lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font></span></font></p><p class="f"><span lang="EN-US"><font style="font-size: 12px;" face="Arial">IObit regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy.
