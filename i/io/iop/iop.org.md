# Privacy policy

References to “IOP” mean the Institute of Physics and/or IOP Publishing as appropriate.  References to “this website” are to the specific IOP website from which the user is linking to this Privacy Policy.

IOP respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and recognises the importance of protecting the information collected about visits to this website.  It has adopted a Privacy Policy that guides how it collects, stores and uses the information provided.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, as, once you use this website, you will be deemed to have read and accepted it.  This Privacy Policy was last updated on 22 June 2010.

 **Information collection, security and use**  
IOP collects information from its users at several different points on this website.  This is for customer service purposes and IOP also collects data so that it can customise this website according to individual selections.

Save where otherwise stated, IOP is the controller of the personal data collected from this website.  In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, IOP follows strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal data which users provide to it, to prevent unauthorised access.  Save where it has a user's express consent, it will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, except that it may make the information available to other companies within its group.

 **Registration**  
In order to receive and/or access some services, users have to complete a registration form.  During registration, a user is required to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address).  This information may be used to contact the user about the services for which they have expressed interest and also about other goods, services and features IOP believes that the user will find interesting.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but it is encouraged so that IOP can provide a more personalised experience.  If a user chooses not to provide such information then they will not be able to access parts of this website and/or will not be able to use all the services offered by this website.  A user may contact IOP about use of their personal information, edit it on this website and/or tell IOP not to use it in certain ways by sending an e-mail message to [data.protection@iop.org](mailto:data.protection@iop.org).

 **Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file written to a user's hard drive and does not contain any personally identifiable information.  The use of cookies is now widespread.  The reason IOP uses cookies is to save its users time on this website (so that they do not have to log in more than once) and also so that IOP can personalise a user's experience of this website.  If a user sets up their browser to reject the cookie, they may still use this website although functionality will be impaired.

 **Log files**  
IOP uses IP addresses to analyse trends, administer this website, track users' movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

 **Links**  
This website contains links to third party websites.  Please be aware that IOP is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites.  It encourages its users to read the privacy statements of these third party websites.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by IOP websites.

 **Surveys and contests**  
From time-to-time this website may request information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information requested.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address) and demographic information.  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of this website.

 **Correcting/updating personal data**  
If a user's personal data changes (such as their postcode), or if a user no longer desires IOP's service, IOP will correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to it.  This can usually be done by the user within any personalisation options of this website or by sending an email to [_custserv@iop.org_](mailto:custserv@iop.org).

 **Notification of changes**  
If IOP decides to change its Privacy Policy, it will make the updated version available via this website so its users are always aware of what information it collects, how it uses it and under what circumstances, if any, it discloses it.  If, at any point, it decides to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, it will notify users.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not IOP uses their information in this different manner.  IOP will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.

 **Your privacy is important to us**  
IOP strives to do everything it can to protect the privacy of its users.  IOP will not sell or rent personally identifiable information obtained via this website to any third parties.

If a user would like to ensure that they are not contacted by IOP with any promotional marketing information as a result of having accessed this website, please contact IOP at [data.protection@iop.org](mailto:data.protection@iop.org), stating the name of this website in the subject line of the e-mail.  Please note that, if a user is a subscriber to an IOP product or service, and/or a member of IOP, sending such an e-mail will not affect any existing contract and IOP shall continue to send the information covered by such a contract until the contractual relationship between IOP and the user comes to an end.
