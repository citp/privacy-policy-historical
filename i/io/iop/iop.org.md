# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

References to “IOP” mean the Institute of Physics and/or IOP Publishing Limited as appropriate.  References to “this web site” are to the specific IOP web site from which the user is linking to this Privacy Policy.

IOP respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and recognises the importance of protecting the information collected about them. It has adopted a Privacy Policy that guides how it collects, stores and uses the information they provide.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, as, once you use this web site, you will be deemed to have read and accepted it.  This Privacy Policy was last updated on 21 June 2006.

 **Information Collection, Security and Use** IOP collects information from its users at several different points on this web site.  This is for customer service purposes and IOP also collects data so that it can customise this web site according to individual selections.

Save where otherwise stated, IOP is the controller of the personal data collected from this web site.  In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, IOP follows strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal data which users provide to it, to prevent unauthorised access.  Save where it has a user’s express consent, it will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, except that it may make the information available to other companies within its group.

 **Registration** In order to receive and/or access some services, users have to complete a registration form. During registration, a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to contact the user about the services for which they have expressed interest and also other goods, services and features IOP believes that users will find interesting.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but it is encouraged so that IOP can provide a more personalised experience.  A user may contact IOP about use of his or her personal information, edit it on this web site and/or tell IOP not to use it in certain ways by sending an e-mail message to data.protection@iop.org.

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file written to a user’s hard drive and does not contain any personally identifiable information.  The use of cookies is now widespread.  The reason IOP uses cookies is to save its users time on this web site (so that they do not have to log in more than once) and also so that IOP can personalise a user's experience of this web site. If a user sets up his or her browser to reject the cookie, he or she may still use this web site although functionality will be impaired.

 **Log Files**

IOP uses IP addresses to analyse trends, administer this web site, track users’ movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

 **Links**

This web site contains links to third party web sites. Please be aware that IOP is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites.  It encourages its users to read the privacy statements of these third party sites.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by IOP web sites.

 **Surveys and Contests** From time-to-time this web site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address) and demographic information.  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of this web site.

 **Correcting/Updating Personal Data** If a user’s personal data changes (such as his or her postcode), or if a user no longer desires IOP’s service, IOP will correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to it.  This can usually be done by the user within the personalization options of this web site or by sending an email to custserv@iop.org.

 **Notification of Changes**

If IOP decides to change its privacy policy, it will make the updated version available via this web site so its users are always aware of what information it collects, how it uses it and under what circumstances, if any, it discloses it.  If, at any point, it decides to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, it will notify users.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not IOP uses their information in this different manner.  IOP will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
