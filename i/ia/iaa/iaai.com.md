Website Privacy Policy
    The following is the manner in which Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc. ("IAA") handles information gathered about you from your visit to this web site (“Site”) through our web pages, newsletters, discussion lists, and announcement lists or when you fill out any of our forms within this Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use or disclosure of information that is collected or obtained by us through means other than this Site. 

By accessing, browsing and/or using this Site, you acknowledge you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the policy provided herein. If you do not agree to this policy, do not use this Site and exit immediately. 

IAA reserves the right to revise this policy at any time without prior notice. If, at any time, you do not agree with the Privacy Policy of this Site, or of any subsequent revisions to the Privacy Policy, immediately discontinue using and accessing this Site. By using this Site, you agree to be bound by any such revisions and you should therefore periodically visit this page to determine the then-current Privacy Policy to which you are bound. 

Personally Identifiable Information  

    You can browse our Site without entering any personal information and thereby remain anonymous during your visit. However, there are cases where we may ask you for personal data. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. For example, IAA may collect names, addresses, email addresses and the like for the purposes of conducting a survey, communicating with a visitor, or to provide additional services such as viewing auction lists, subscribing to newsletters, entering contests or providing requested information relating to new products, web site updates, or inquiries. Whenever we request the identity of a visitor or customer, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested and then only use the information for the purpose for which it was obtained. For example, when you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. If you choose not to give information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, contests, offers, and services. 

When you purchase products from us, request product information or otherwise provide us with personal information, we may automatically place you on our list to receive e-mail regarding product updates, special offers, important issues and new products. If you do not wish to receive these e-mail messages, you can simply respond by telling us that you do not want to receive any future communications or contact our Customer Support organization at the contact points specified below. We maintain a "No-Spam" policy and once you are on one of our mailing list we will not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise give your email address to a third party without your consent, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. 

In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete personal information (such as your address), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting our Customer Support organization at the contact points specified below. 

Collective Data and Cookies  

    IAA’s Site deposits certain bits of information called "cookies" in a visitor's computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. Cookies are sent back only to the web site that deposited them when a visitor returns to that site. We use cookies to identify which areas of our Site you have visited or used. Cookies can tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. This technology does not collect personally identifiable information, only information that is in aggregate form or that does not otherwise reveal your identity. With this information, we learn about visitor’s browsing habits within this Site, and we hope to improve our Site with this technology. 

Third paty vendors may show our ads on sites on the internet. These third party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website. You may opt out of this use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol address" also known as the "IP address." When a visitor requests a page from our Site, our web servers automatically receive that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Site. We use this information to examine our Site traffic, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our web servers do not record the email addresses of the visitors to our Site unless you voluntarily provide that information to us. 

Purchasing and/or Registering Products or Services   

    If you are purchasing merchandise from IAA we need to know your personal information, including your name, email address, mailing address, shipping address, etc. This allows us to process your transaction and to notify you of your purchase status. In addition, we may use this information to notify you of related products and services, however your information will not be shared or sold to any third parties for any purpose except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. For all purchases, we use a shopping cart feature that safeguards your order information using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. This type of technology is also called a secure web site or a secure server. You will know when you are on a secure web site when the front of the web address has "https" instead of the normal "http".

IAA does not share any of the personal information you provide with the sites to which IAA links.
