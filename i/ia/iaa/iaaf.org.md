If you believe that any information we are holding for you is incorrect or incomplete, please e-mail us as soon as possible to the addresses below. 

**6.      EU Data Protection Rights**

If you are from the European Union then it may be that the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016 applies to how the IAAF handles your personal information. The IAAF has several obligations in relation to how it handles your personal data. The IAAF is committed to the key principles of transparency, consent (where applicable), security and data minimisation. Alongside relying on the IAAF meeting it obligations, you have several rights that you are entitled to exercise under these regulations. These are:

The right to object

One key right is the right to stop processing (right to object): This allows you to do three things:

  * You object to the disclosure of your information to the third parties listed above, but we must inform you that it will be difficult to process your application/registration for the purposes of providing the services on which you engage with the website and be provided with information without that information being disclosed.
  * You have the right to object to IAAF processing information about you where we process based on 'legitimate interest'. We have stated above that the legal basis on which rely to process your personal information is consent and we do not currently rely on ‘legitimate interests’ to process it.
  * You have the right to ask the IAAF not to process personal data for purposes of sending you direct marketing.



The other rights are:

  * Right of access: In accordance with the provisions of the data protection laws, you have certain rights to request a copy of your own personal information held by the IAAF. You can request to receive a copy of your personal information in a readily understandable format within a reasonable timeframe (one month from the date of the request).
  * Right to rectification: You have the right to ask to rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal information which it has about you after you have been registered for accreditation. Where the IAAF positively knows that the personal information that it is processing is inaccurate or incomplete, the IAAF shall, as appropriate, rectify, amend, complete or update the relevant personal information as soon as possible. Where appropriate, if the personal information in question has been disclosed to a third party that is known or believed to continue to process the personal information, the third party shall be informed of the change as soon as possible.
  * Right to erasure: you have the right to ask to erase your personal information in some circumstances, including where the information held by the IAAF is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, you withdraw your consent to its use, or we can no longer lawfully process the data. However, if you do exercise this right during the accreditation process then it will make providing the basis for you to participate in events difficult.
  * Right to restriction of processing: you can restrict our processing of your data in some circumstances. This applies where, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the personal data we use or object to us using the information based on a 'legitimate interest' (see part 1, above (the right to object)). Please note that where you ask us to restrict processing, we can still store it subject to the retention period, and use it to establish or defend legal claims, which may run beyond the retention period stated.
  * Right to data portability: This permits you to receive from the IAAF a copy of your personal information in an electronic file or format that commonly be used on different devices and machines, and to transfer your personal data from the IAAF to another data controller or have the data transmitted directly between two data controllers.
  * Right to object to automatic processing: you have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing which significantly affect them (at time of writing, the IAAF does not process your personal data on its systems for the purposes of making decisions based on automatic processing).
