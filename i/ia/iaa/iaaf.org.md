WEBSITE – PRIVACY POLICY

 **1.         Introduction**

Your personal information is being processed by the IAAF.  The IAAF respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.  This Privacy Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us through the IAAF network of websites and/or other services provided by the IAAF.

In order to provide you with the full range of services, we may request and/or record information about you.  This Privacy Policy explains the following:

  *  **the type of information we collect;**
  *  **how the information is used;**
  *  **where the information is stored;**
  *  **when we may contact you;**
  *  **whether we will disclose your details to anyone else; and**
  *  **the use of cookies.**



IAAF websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy notices and we encourage you to review them. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

 **2.         What type of personal information is collected?**

When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from any IAAF website, such as a newsletter, competition or forum, we will ask for limited personal information. This can include information such as your name, postal address, telephone or mobile number, email address, gender or date of birth. Different IAAF websites may ask for different pieces of personal information. By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable IAAF and its service providers to provide you with the services you select.

 **3.         How will the information be used?**

IAAF will use your personal information for a number of non-marketing purposes including the following:

  1.  **we may contact you for service related reasons that you have subscribed to, signed up for, or participate in**
  2.  **to invite you to share your opinions and comments through a research study about the level of service you receive from us;**
  3.  **to track traffic flows and to make our websites easier for you to use;**
  4.  **to fulfil subscription orders;**
  5.  **to provide a user online community; and for**
  6.  **planning and managing our business activities by understanding aggregated analysis on behaviour and habits;**



 **4.         Where will the information be stored?**

Information that we collect from you may be transferred and stored outside of Monaco for the purposes of supplying our goods and services to you.  By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

We will always take all reasonable precautions to make sure that your data remains secure and is handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You should be advised however that the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically.  Any transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk.  Where we have given you (or you have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of the site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

  1. 


Yes. The IAAF may use the information you have provided to promote the products and services of the IAAF or others.

However, be assured that we understand the irritations of unsolicited communications and are fully committed to ensuring your rights and obligations are respected.

 **If you don’t want it, you won’t get it**.  Any marketing communication you receive will always include a clear, simple option to refuse, or ‘opt-out’ of such future communications. You may also opt-out at ANY time by contacting us (see below).

 **5.         Will ****IAAF share my information with anyone else?**

IAAF may disclose your personal data where it believes it is compelled to do so by law; in particular for the prevention or detection of crime, the capture or prosecution of offenders; and the assessment or collection of tax or duty.

Occasionally, we may share your contact information with carefully selected third party companies whose products and services we feel may be of interest to you.  We will keep these offers relevant to your interests.  It is easy to unsubscribe from any email or mobile messages you no longer want by contacting us (see below).

We use a number of third party organisations to help provide a professional service to our customers. These organizations act as data processors and are strictly controlled in how they may/may not use your personal data.  We remain responsible for the protection of your data.

Please note that some of our partners may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Countries outside the EEA may not be required to protect personal information as stringently as countries inside.

 **6.         Can I find out what personal information the ****IAAF holds on me?**

Yes.  You have the right to request a copy of the personal information that the IAAF holds about you. There will be an administration fee associated with this request and we will require two pieces of identification to prove your identity. 

If you believe that any information we are holding for you is incorrect or incomplete, please e-mail us as soon as possible to the address below.  We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect. 

**7.         Changes to the ****IAAF Privacy Policy?**

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time with or without notice, including in order to comply with new practices or regulations.  This policy was last updated on 31 October 2012.  You may wish to visit this page every time you submit personal information to one of the IAAF’s websites.

 **8.         Cookies and your privacy**

In order to enable us to provide you with a personalised browsing experience, this website uses 'cookie' information collection technology. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are issued to your computer when you enter a website.  Cookies are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive, and they can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as identifying your computer's previous visits to a website, and to ascertain the most popular features of a website.

This website uses cookies as they enable us to identify your computer when you visit the website. For example, cookies can make it possible for us to identify and automatically log in registered users of certain services on the website without the need for us to ask users for their registration details and password each time they visit. We also use cookies to develop a clearer picture of which parts of the website are the most popular to its visitors, and your preferences.  

Overall, cookies help us to provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not.  A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data that you have chosen to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  Please note however that this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
