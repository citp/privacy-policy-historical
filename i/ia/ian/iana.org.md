  6. ### International Transfers

By using our Website or providing us with your Personal Information electronically, the User is directly transferring Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information to us in the United States. The User's Personal Information also may be transferred and Processed in other countries where our staff or third-party service providers are located. The United States and such other countries may not have the same level of information protection as the User's jurisdiction.

Whenever such transfers are by one of our location in a country outside the United States to another of our location in the United States, they are based on contractual commitments, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement), or other applicable data transfer arrangements, in order to contractually provide that your Personal Information is subject to adequate levels of data protection. You may request further information concerning such contractual commitments by sending a request to [privacy@icann.org](mailto:privacy@icann.org).

The User is solely responsible for compliance with any information protection or privacy obligations in the User's jurisdiction when using the Website or providing us with Personal Information. By submitting Personal Information, the User agrees to such Processing.

  7. ### Information Security and Integrity

We will use reasonable industry standard safeguards (which may include physical, procedural and technical measures) to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information it collects and holds. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information collected is complete and relevant to its intended use.

The Website contains links to other third-party websites, which are subject to the respective privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such linked third-party sites, and their owners and operators.

The Website may contain social media widgets including Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, and other features that may collect a User's Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information, and may set Cookies on the User's devices unless the device or browser settings prevent such Cookies from being stored. Such social media widgets and features may be hosted by a third party. We are not responsible for the operation of such widgets and features, and any information collection will be subject to the privacy policy of the provider of such widgets and features, and not this Privacy Policy.

Due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot represent, warrant or guarantee that communications stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties, loss, misuse, or alterations. While we will take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Personal Information received, **WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OR COMPROMISE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. USERS ARE ADVISED THAT THEY SUBMIT SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION AT THEIR OWN RISK**.

Users also may be entitled to withdraw any consent given with prospective effect with respect to the Processing of their Personal Information. Users can exercise these rights or learn more about the Processing of Personal Information by us, by sending a request to [privacy@icann.org](mailto:privacy@icann.org).

If a User no longer wishes to receive certain electronic communications from us, the User may opt-out from such communication by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of such communication or by accessing any available preference setting functionality in the Website.
