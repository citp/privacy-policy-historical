<p>Deloitte Global Services Limited (<b>DGSL</b>) operates this website and is a privacy conscious organization. The following privacy statement explains how DGSL protects visitors' information gathered via this website. If you as a visitor choose to register or submit information to this website, you agree to the use of such data in accordance with this privacy statement. Please note that this site contains links to other web sites, including, without limitation, web sites maintained by member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (each a "<b>DTTL Member Firm</b>") or their affiliates, which may not be governed by this privacy statement. </p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this privacy statement or do not feel that your concerns have been addressed, please direct your questions to <a href="mailto:info@iasplus.com"><b>info @ iasplus.com</b></a>. </p>
<p><b class="b">Information Collection </b></p>
<p>As a visitor, you do not have to submit any personal information in order to use this website. The site collects only personal information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors. Such information may consist of, but is not limited to, your name, current job title, company address, email address and telephone and fax numbers. </p>
<p>DGSL does not usually seek sensitive information (e.g., data relating to race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental health, or sexual orientation) from visitors. DGSL will, where necessary, obtain visitors' explicit consent to collect and use such information. </p>
<p><b class="b">Cookies and Web Beacons </b></p>
<p>To ensure that this website is well managed and to facilitate improved navigation within the site, DGSL or its service provider(s) may use cookies (small text files stored in a user's browser) or Web beacons (electronic images that allow the website to count visitors who have accessed a particular page and to access certain cookies) to collect aggregate data. DGSL may use such devices to track information on our systems and identify categories of visitors by items such as IP address, domain, browser type and pages visited. This information is reported to our webmasters who use the information to analyze the number of visitors to different areas of the site and to help make sure that this website is serving as a useful, effective information source. </p>
<p>Neither our cookies nor Web beacons collect any personal information such as your name or email address. Further, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. Learn more about cookies and how to reject them. However, under specific circumstances, visitors may be denied access to some parts of our site if their browsers are set to decline cookies. </p>
<p><b class="b">Information Use </b></p>
<p>Personal information is used only for limited purposes. For example, when you register to gain access to premium content, sign up for e-learning, respond to a survey, or request future communications about specific areas of interest, such as publications or marketing campaigns, the information you submit may be used to:  create a personal profile that will allow us to manage our relationship with you; provide you with information we feel would be of interest to you;  facilitate responding to further requests or inquiries from you; or otherwise personalize your website experience. In addition, the webmasters may, where necessary, use your information for various site related tasks.

<p><b class="b">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties </b></p>
<p>Although DGSL may provide visitors' information to service providers that handle information on its behalf, DGSL will usually not share the information with third parties for secondary or unrelated purposes unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. </p>
<p>Personal information may be transmitted internationally through the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited worldwide network of firms or to third parties for the purposes identified above. This may include transfer to countries without data protection rules similar to those in effect in a visitor's country of residence. By providing information through this website, you are consenting to such transfers. Where appropriate, personal information may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory or other government agencies, or third parties where necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests or for the purposes identified above. </p>
