					<p align="left">IATA respects your privacy and recognizes the need to protect the personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number) you share with us . We would like to assure you that we follow appropriate standards when it comes to protecting your privacy on our web sites.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">In general, you can visit IATA web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. </p>
<p align="left">Some of our web pages use "cookies" so that we can better serve you with customized information when you return to our site. Cookies are identifiers which a web site can send to your browser to keep on your computer to facilitate your next visit to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the option to decide whether or not to accept it. The information we collect and analyze is used to improve our service to you. </p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. Generally, you will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the IATA web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services. </p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">IATA will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any information derived from the registration for, or use of, any online service (including names and addresses) without the consent of the user or customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the user or others). When IATA uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, IATA will ensure that the company protects your personally identifiable information consistent with this policy. </p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">IATA will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us. We have implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use or disclosure. IATA will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available.</p>

<p align="left">The IATA Online Store: <br>Privacy Protection Measures</p></i></b>
<p align="left"></p><b>
<p align="left">Your personal information</p></b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">The <b>IATA Online Store</b> believes that your personal information deserves protection. IATA's Online Store provides such protection through its policy of minimal usage of personal information for online purchases and reliance upon advanced data encryption.</p><b>
<p align="left">Email Privacy at the Online Store</p></b>
<p align="left">We ask for your e-mail address for online purchases in order to communicate with you about your order. We do not currently rent, sell or exchange e-mail addresses. We may use your e-mail address to communicate advance notice of events, new products and services.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">What does the IATA Online Store use your personal information for?</p>
<ul>
<p align="left">
</p><li>
<div align="left">To build your <b>IATA Online Store</b> account.</div>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
</li><li>
<div align="left">To process your orders. </div>
<p align="left"></p></li></ul>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">The <b>IATA Online Store</b> is committed to keeping your personal information confidential. Below are details about the information we collect, when we collect it and how we use it:</p>
<p align="left"></p><b>
</b><p align="left"><b>When you place an order</b> with the <b>IATA Online Store</b> we collect your name, address, telephone number, credit card information and your e-mail address. We use this information to fulfill your order and to communicate with you about your order.</p>
<p align="left"></p><b>
</b><p align="left"><b>When you register </b>with the <b>IATA Online Store</b> we collect your name, address, telephone number and your e-mail address. If you're a registered customer, you enter your billing and shipping information only once each time you shop and you can also access your Order History (under "My Account") to review information about past online purchases.</p>
<p align="left"></p><b>
</b><p align="left"><b>You can review or revise your personal information at any time</b>. Simply click "My Account" at the top of any page on our site.</p>
<p align="left"></p><b>
</b><p align="left"><b>You can create a list of products </b>you may want to buy later. Simply click "My Products" at the top of any page on our site.</p>
<p align="left"></p><b>
<p align="left">Cookies</p></b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Depending on how you have configured your browser, when you shop at the <b>IATA Online Store</b>, a small file - a "cookie" - is stored on your computer. You have the option on your browser to notify you when you are sent a "Cookie" and decide whether to accept it. Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to your computer's hard drive to help make shopping online easier and to tailor and keep records of your visits to the site. The use of cookies is common on the Internet and many major web sites use them. When you visit the <b>IATA Online Store</b> , your cookie allows us to recognize you as a repeat customer. This allows us to retrieve certain information you provided previously so that you do need to re-enter this information every time you shop with us. Cookies also enable us to store items in your shopping bag between visits and provide you with access to your account information. If you request to receive e-mail updates from us your cookie helps us deliver messages that we think might be of interest to you. </p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">If you arrive on the <b>IATA Online Store</b> with your Cookies turned off, you won't be identified until you register and sign-in.<b></b></p><b>
<p align="left">Does the IATA Online Store disclose personal customer information to third parties?</p></b><u>
<p align="left"></p></u>
<p align="left">Users' non-aggregated specific personal information is not currently sold, rented or made available to anyone other than the <b>IATA Online Store</b>, but we may decide to do so in the future. If this were to happen, the <b>IATA Online Store</b> would announce such a plan and ask you to "opt in". By default, we'd assume that you don't want in - if you wanted to share your personal information, you would have to respond positively. In the absence of such a response, your information would not be shared with anyone other than the <b>IATA Online Store</b>.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">The <b>IATA Online Store</b> reserves the right to cooperate with local, provincial and national law enforcement officials in any investigation requiring either personal information -- including any personal information provided online through the <b>IATA Online Store</b> -- or reports about lawful or unlawful user activities on this site.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">The <b>IATA Online Store</b> also reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We also reserve the right at any time to disclose any information in an individual's account: </p>
<p align="left">i. to satisfy any law, regulation, law enforcement investigation or subpoena; <br>ii. to protect the rights or property of the <b>IATA Online Store</b> and its users, sponsors, providers, licensors or merchants.</p><u>
<p align="left"></p></u><b>
<p align="left">Shopping at the IATA Online Store is safe and secure</p></b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">At the <b>IATA Online Store</b> protecting your information is a priority. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. When you provide us with any personal information - your name, address, e-mail and credit card number - it's done on a secure server. One of today's most advanced security systems, SSL encrypts all information you provide before sending it to our own server. </p>
<p align="left">Only when it reaches the <b>IATA Online Store</b> servers is your information decrypted. <br></p>
<p align="left">How can you be sure any connection is secure? Simply look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing a server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), the SSL is active and your information is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from 'http' to 'https.' Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication even though the server is secure.</p><b>
<p align="left"></p>
</b><p align="left"><b>Comments or questions</b> </p>
<p align="left">If you have any comments or questions about our Privacy Policy and its application to transactions on the Online Store, send us an e-mail at the following address: <a href="mailto:privacy@iata.org">privacy@iata.org</a><u>.</u></p>
