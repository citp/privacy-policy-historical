# IAFSTORE - Customer Care - Privacy Policy

**Optional or compulsory communication of personal data**

Communicating your personal data to IAFSTORE when requested in any of the many instances where personal data is collected through the site may be essential in order to achieve the purposes set down by the communication itself, or not prejudicial in this regard.  
The compulsory or optional nature of the data provision is specified each time – with reference to the specific data requested – at the point of input for each data collection, by marking compulsory information with an asterisk (*).  
If you refuse to communicate the information marked as compulsory to IAFSTORE, it will be impossible to achieve the main purpose of the specific data collection: such a refusal might, for example, make it impossible for IAFSTORE to fulfill the product sale agreement on IAFSTORE.COM or provide the other services available on IAFSTORE.COM (assistance, forwarding of the IAFNEWS newsletter).  
Communicating additional data to IAFSTORE, other than those marked as compulsory, is optional and will not produce any consequences with regard to the main purposes of the collection (such as using the web site and its services or purchasing the products on sale, for example).

**Data supervisors**

Currently some of the data supervisors charged with processing your personal data are the following:

United Parcel Service, BRT S.p.A. that processes the data required to organise and carry out shipment, delivery and return of products purchased on our web site;

certification that the operations described at letters a) and b) have been notified, even with regard to their contents, to the persons to whom your data has been communicated or disseminated, except in those instances where such certification turns out to be impossible or would require a clearly disproportionate deployment of means compared to the right protected.

You do, in any case, have the right to totally or partially oppose:lower-alpha

processing of your personal data, for valid reasons, even if pertinent to the purpose of collection;
