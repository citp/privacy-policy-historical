# Privacy Statement

_Privacy_

iaf.net promotes responsible use and dissemination of information. We fully support and adhere to the Individual Services Group Principles (IRSG), the GLB act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

All information provided by iaf.net is either from public records or publicly available information. The products provided are intended to be used for locating individuals for various lawful purposes, e.g. reuniting old friends, finding lost relatives, re-establishing business contacts, adoption reunification, class reunion searches, and other harmless activities of sorts.

But we don't stop there. As a self imposed rule, we also DO NOT maintain nor sell information on known minors, celebrities, government officials, or members of law enforcement. Additionally, we NEVER provide full social security numbers or full date of births to anyone in any of our reports.

Furthermore, we at iaf.net have put in place another level of scrutiny. Although the order taking process is automated, the order processing part isn't. Another filter for inappropriate requests is placed on all incoming orders which are reviewed by a live person in our Compliance Dept. who runs the order through a series of checks and balances which allows us to catch suspicious orders.

To enable this level of filtering, all orders placed with us require full disclosure of buyer's identity, including name, address and phone, which many of our competitors do not. This allows us to enforce the various filtering and alarm mechanisms we have in place, and often to check with the buyer on the validity and motive of their order. We cannot reveal what these filters are in this page so as not to give someone a chance to circumvent them, but they do work and as a matter of extremely safe and conservative practices on our part, we end up turning down approx. 1% of all orders. These same mechanisms are also used to protect both the buyer and us from online fraud.

We are committed to protect your privacy and credit while providing the highest quality data possible to our customers, and  maintaining a high degree of respect for the sensitive nature of the information provided. As a matter of policy, iaf.net will not sell information to individuals who do not agree to its lawful use, nor to anyone under the age of 18. Nor will it sell information about individuals who it knows to be under the age of 18. 

__What about me the buyer?__  
iaf.net does not use, sell, compile, nor in any way record information from the visitors to our web site for marketing or any other purposes other than strictly for the purposes of billing/collection and services as represented by our web site, or for voluntary subscriptions to our mailing list via a separate independent subscription database. Your private information remains private.
