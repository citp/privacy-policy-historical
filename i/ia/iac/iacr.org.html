<h2>IACR Privacy Policy</h2>


The following statement discloses the IACR's information gathering and 
dissemination practices.

<p>

The IACR maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and 
member profile information, as well as a record of each member's 
registrations for conferences. The information in these databases is used 
by authorized officers and board delegated organization staff to process 
registrations; mail invoices, renewal notices, and announcements; and 
respond to member inquiries. Member records are maintained as long as an 
individual is an IACR member and for at least three years following a 
membership lapse. Registration databases may be retained for up to three years.

</p><p>

IACR does not log any accesses from your IP address to our Web site
Personal information is stored in a relational database and standard 
security methods are used to protect it. We require confirmation of 
identity before releasing information back to the user for update over the Web.

</p><p>

Commercial information (such as credit card numbers) is obtained using our 
secure Web server and may be stored on our machines for as long as is 
needed for processing. Such information is deleted using reasonable 
diligence as soon as is practical after it is no longer required, for 
example after the conference has occurred.

</p><p>

The IACR does not rent or sell email addresses. The IACR may use email 
addresses to contact members to answer member questions or to acknowledge 
the receipt of membership applications and conference registrations, to 
send membership renewal notices, and to send occasional announcements about 
IACR events to those members who have not opted out of receiving such 
announcements. These announcements are short straightforward messages that 
contain pointers to online resources where members can explore the 
information more fully.

</p><p>

The IACR may use the postal addresses of its members to mail invoices, 
products, and announcements from the IACR. IACR member names and mailing 
addresses are never rented or sold. Membership lists are sent to the 
members periodically.

</p><p>

Our site gives you the opportunity to opt out from either receiving email 
communications or from having your name and address made available to 
anyone other than the IACR. When registering for a conference, you have the 
option not to be on the Attendee list. You have the option not to be listed 
in the annual membership list.

</p><p>

The IACR site gives users the opportunity to update information previously 
provided by using the online form found at http://www.iacr.org/iacrmem/, or 
email to <a href="mailto:iacrmem@iacr.org">iacrmem@iacr.org</a>, or by
physical mail to:
</p><blockquote>
   IACR General Secretariat
   Santa Rosa Administrative Center
   University of California
   Santa Barbara, CA  93106-6120
   USA
</blockquote>
Note: Information is always updated whenever a new conference registration 
is submitted or upon renewal of a membership.

<p>

This site contains links to other sites. The IACR is not responsible for 
the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
