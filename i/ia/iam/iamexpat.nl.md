# Privacy policy

_This Privacy Policy was last updated on  March 31, 2019._

IamExpat Media (hereinafter “ **IamExpat** ”), is an English-language online media platform, providing up-to-date information, news, job listings, housing services and lifestyle tips for internationals in the Netherlands and Germany through the operation of the IamExpat.com, IamExpat.nl and IamExpat.de websites (“hereinafter “IamExpat Website(s)”). IamExpat also organises the annual IamExpat Fair in Amsterdam and The Hague, an event designed to connect and support the expat community in the Netherlands.

In order to achieve our mission of providing the IamExpat community with our websites and services, we collect certain personal information from users of the IamExpat Websites (hereinafter “ **Users** ” or “ **you** ”) for the purposes specifically described and under the conditions laid down in this Privacy Policy.

Providing personal information is optional; however, Users opting not to share such information may not be allowed access to certain features of the IamExpat Website. Users are responsible for filling in correct and truthful information, and are thus responsible for any actual or potential economic or legal lawsuit against IamExpat, should this occur as a consequence of their wrongdoing or mismanagement of their profile. User accounts are for personal use and may not be used by, assigned, or otherwise transferred to any other person or entity. Users are responsible for the security of their password and will be solely liable for any use or unauthorized use of said password.

Our Users’ privacy is of paramount importance to us. We therefore strive to be transparent about how we collect, use and share information about you. We endeavour to provide you with the highest standards of security for any personal information you submit to us.

This Privacy Policy provides details about the information we collect about you when you use our websites and services, or otherwise interact with us (for example, by attending our events), unless a different specific policy is displayed. 

## 1\. User Information That We Collect

When using specific features on the website, such as the IamExpat “Find a Job” feature (hereinafter “ **IamExpat Jobs** ”) and the IamExpat Housing feature, you may be asked to submit additional information. This information is necessary for you to be able to apply for a job vacancy or make an enquiry for a property (see Section 4 below in detail). In such cases, as well as when participating in competitions running on the IamExpat Websites, or when wishing to contact authors of website content, you will specifically be asked to submit additional information through separate online forms.

### 1.5 Facebook visitor action pixels

We use the “visitor action pixels” from Facebook Inc on our websites. This tool allows us to understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with [Facebook’s Data Usage Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). You can allow Facebook and its partners to place ads on and off Facebook. A cookie may also be stored on your computer for these purposes.

You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads).

## 2\. How We Use the Information We Collect

We may occasionally conduct research and analysis of Users’ behavior to improve our websites content and services.

  * _Ensuring  legal compliance:_

We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.

### 4.6 Legal Compliance and Enforcement of Rights

## 5\. Information Storage and Security

We work hard to protect our Users from unauthorized access to, or alteration, disclosure or destruction of, your personal information. Our data hosting service providers are based in Germany and in the Netherlands.

Access to User data is not available to unauthorized IamExpat employees. All IamExpat employees comply with the IamExpat employee privacy policy and undertake training on privacy and security.

While we implement safeguards designed to protect our Users’ information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

## 6\. How Long We Keep Information

We retain your IamExpat account information for as long as your account is active. You may select to cancel your account at any time. After selecting to cancel your account, we implement a safety retention window of thirty (30) days. During this period, account information will be retained, although the account will, of course, not be visible on our services anymore. We will delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) unless:

  * We must keep it to comply with applicable law;
  * We must keep it as evidence of our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consent to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents);
  * There is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved;
  * The information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a User who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.



## 7\. Your Rights

We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:

### 7.1 Access and update your information

Our websites and services give you the ability to access and update certain personal information. For example, you can access your profile information using the “My Account” feature.

If you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent. This will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.
