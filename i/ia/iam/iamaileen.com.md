### ADVERTISERS & SPONSORS DISCLOSURE

This blog is also open to forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, paid insertions, and other forms of compensation and/or projects. But even though this blog is open to advertising, I will never recommend and write about products or brands that I don’t personally use nor believe in. I will always disclose whether I will be receiving any commissions or products for free, or if a trip was sponsored or not.

But I am definitely not responsible for the actions of my advertisers or sponsors. If you purchase a product or service based upon a link from my website, you must take action with that company to resolve any issues and NOT with me. Any product, claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.

What’s more is that some of the links on the website are affiliate or referral links. At no additional cost to you, I will earn a small percentage of the sale if you make a purchase through my affiliate link or I will earn a bonus from your registration through my referral link. In fact, the cost for you will sometimes even be cheaper due to my partnership with a certain brand — so it’s a “win-win” situation for the both of us. Rest assured, I only support things that I trust and have personally used. Ultimately, I hope for your understanding that this is a way for me to keep this website running in tiptop shape; so your purchases or registration through any of my affiliate links is much appreciated!

### CONTACT
