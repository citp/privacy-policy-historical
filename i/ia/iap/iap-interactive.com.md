## 1\. What information do we collect about you?

We collect the information you provide by email and in completing our recruitment questionnaire when you decide to join our panel.

We collect your Facebook basic profile information (meaning your name, e-mail address, gender, birthday and location) that you have consented to our using when you connect to, and use the Ipsos Access Panels Facebook Applications within your Facebook account.

We also collect information when you voluntarily complete any of the surveys we invite you to participate in, or you provide feedback, comments or other information on our panel members’ website.

## 2\. How will we use the information you provide?

We will use the information you provide to:

  * Keep a record of all panel members.
  * Send you invitations to participate in surveys that are relevant to you based on the information you provided in response to our recruitment questionnaire(s).
  * Append personal information about you to your responses to any surveys you participate in, such as geographical location, ethnicity, occupation categories etc for the purpose of analysing the survey responses and producing anonymous, statistical research results.
  * Enter you into any prize draws that you are eligible to take part in or, where invited to do so, have asked to be entered into.
  * With your explicit consent when asked in a survey, to pass your individual survey responses together with your personal information to the client who commissioned the survey. The client will use this information only for research purposes as explained in the survey. The client may also use this information to contact you in order to invite your participation in further research they conduct, but only where you have been informed of this and have explicitly consented to your information being used by the client for this purpose.
  * To create anonymous, statistical profiles of panel membership based on the information provided by panel members.
  * With your consent, to pass your information to other Ipsos Group companies so that they may invite you to participate in research studies they are carrying out that may relevant to you.



We may also send your information to our sub-contractors who may carry out some of the work we do on our behalf, and under our control.

We will NEVER use your information for any purpose other than research. We will NOT try to sell you anything, nor use your information for marketing purposes. Nor will we ever pass your information to third parties for marketing purposes.

For more information about our panels, panel membership or information related to your membership of one of our panels, please contact our Panel Support Team. They can be contacted by:

Email sent to: [epanel-uk@ipsosinteractive.com](mailto:epanel-uk@ipsosinteractive.com)

## 3\. Children

For any panels or surveys aimed at children, we will always seek consent from a parent, legal guardian or other person legally responsible for the child before inviting them to join a panel or take part in the research.

## 4\. Use of Cookies and similar code?

Some on-line surveys collect information through the use of 'cookies'. These are small files stored on your computer. These files are used as sparingly as possible and only for quality control, validation and, more importantly, to prevent us sending you reminders for any on-line survey you have already completed. It is possible for you to delete 'cookies' or to prevent their use by adjusting the browser settings on your computer.

We also automatically capture information about your IP Address, operating system, screen display settings, browser type, and use of Flash and Java. We use this information to:

  * Ensure that the survey questionnaire is delivered in a form suited to the software your computer is using.
  * Assist in providing support to you should you have difficulty accessing or completing a survey.
  * Anonymised information is also used for research purposes. For example to determine the percentage of our panellists in a specific country who use a certain type of browser.



With your prior agreement, we may also install advanced cookies or similar code that can identify tags attached to certain web-sites or on-line advertisements relating to our clients and/or their products. Alternatively, again with your prior agreement, we may scan for and read cookies or code installed by other websites that you may have visited. The information obtained in this way will be used to help us send you surveys that are relevant to you (for example, you may be asked your opinion on ads that you've actually seen), or for other research into internet usage.

## 5\. Use of Digital fingerprinting?

We may use digital fingerprinting technology, also known as "Machine Identification" digital fingerprints, to gather certain information about your computer hardware and software, for example, your IP address, the display settings of your monitor, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, etc. This information is sent to our trusted third-party partner who converts it into a unique serial number – the digital "fingerprint" – and determines if it matches previous fingerprints. The data collected in this process and the digital fingerprint created is not tied to any of your personal information, is stored on secured servers, and is only used for quality control purposes and to help prevent panellists from completing the same survey many times.

## 6\. How long will we keep the information you provide?

We will keep the information you provided when you joined our panel, together with any information you provided in response to a recruitment questionnaire for as long as you remain a member of the panel. You can leave the panel at any time you wish. We may also remove you from our panel if you are not taking part in any surveys, are no longer eligible to be a member of any other reason, or the panel is closed. Before removing anyone from our panel, we will contact them to let them know and provide details of how to remain a panel member where appropriate. However, in the event we consider you breach IIS' rules or terms and conditions, IIS may remove you from our panel without any notice and your access to the panellist website and to your points account will be closed.

When you leave the panel, are removed, or the panel is closed, we will delete all your contact details, together with any other information that could be used to identify you, leaving only anonymous responses to surveys that you participated in.

## 7\. How can you get access to your information and/or correct it?

## 8\. How do you ensure my personal information is secure?

These precautions include appropriate physical security of our offices, controlled access to computer systems, and use of secure, encrypted internet connections when collecting personal information.
