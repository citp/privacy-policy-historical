We may also track usage through cookies. A cookie is a small data file written to a user's hard drive.

We may also collect information about your job history and experience, and your education when you submit your application for employment with IGT or our subsidiaries or affiliates on or through our Site.

IGT may analyze or disclose aggregated information that does not identify our users to third parties for marketing and promotional or other purposes.

We also share user information with our subsidiaries, affiliates, business partners and service providers. These third parties may provide you information, products, or services on our behalf or to help us provide our customers with better products and services.

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if all or substantially all the assets of IGT or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates assets were acquired, user information would be one of the transferred assets. We do not offer for sale personally identifiable information other than in connection with business-related transfers.

IGT reserves the right to disclose user or visitor information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) IGT's rights or property, other users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. IGT may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
