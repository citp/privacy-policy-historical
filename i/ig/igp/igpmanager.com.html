                only process your personal data if at least one of the following basis
                applies:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    you have given consent to the processing of your personal data for one
                    or more specific purposes;
                </li>
                <li>
                    processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you
                    are a party or in order to take steps at the request of you prior to
                    entering into a contract;
                </li>
                <li>
                    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
                    we are subject;
                </li>
                <li>
                    processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or of
                    another natural person;
                </li>
                <li>
                    processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
                    the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
                    controller; and/or
                </li>
                <li>
                    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
                    pursued by us or by a third party such as our credit card payment
                    processing, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental
                    rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of
                    personal data.

                misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you. We store
                your personal information on secured servers in secured facilities with
                restricted access, protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure
                the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to
                personal information to iGP Games employees, independent contractors and
                agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and
                maintain the Site and the Game. All iGP Games personnel who have access to
                this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use additional security measures to enhance security, such as analysing
                account behaviour for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behaviour, may
                limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may
                remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend
                or disable accounts for violations of our Terms of Service.

                Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your
                information, please be aware that no server, computer or communications
                network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
                to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user

                you transmit to us through the use of the Game or the Site and we make no
                assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss or misuse to you or

                information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. You can
                reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as
                choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different
                services, and using up to date antivirus software.

                Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. In certain
                instances, some entities also have their own policies regarding privacy and

            <h2>V. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

            <p>
                A. You agree that should any dispute or claim arise out of, or relate to,
                this Policy ("Claim"), you will attempt in good faith to negotiate a
                written resolution of the Claim directly with us. You agree that if the
                matter remains unresolved for thirty (30) days after one party has provided

                mediation services in England with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt

            <h2>VI. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND PROFILING</h2>

            <p>
                A. We use automated decisions and profiling to offer discounts and certain
                products.
            </p>
            <p>
                B. In the event that we use personal data for the purposes of automated
                decision-making and those decisions have a legal (or similarly significant
                effect) on you, you have the right to challenge to such decisions under
                GDPR, requesting human intervention, expressing their own point of view,
                and obtaining an explanation of the decision from us.
            </p>
            <p>
                C. The right described in section VI.C does not apply in the following
                circumstances:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    the decision is necessary for the entry into, or performance of, a
                    contract between the you and us;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the decision is authorised by law; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    you have given you explicit consent.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                D. Where we use your personal data for profiling purposes, the following
                shall apply:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Clear information explaining the profiling will be provided, including
                    its significance and the likely consequences;
                </li>
                <li>Appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures will be used; </li>
                <li>Technical and organisational measures necessary to minimise the risk of
                    errors and to enable such errors to be easily corrected shall be
                    implemented; and </li>
                <li>All personal data processed for profiling purposes shall be secured in
                    order to prevent discriminatory effects arising out of profiling. </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>VII. ACCOUNT DEACTIVATION AND DELETION</h2>

            <p>
                If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate or delete it.
                When you deactivate and account, no user will be able to see your manager
                profile but it will not be deleted and can be reactivated. When you delete
                an account it is permanently deleted from the Game and cannot be recovered.
                To request deactivation or deletion of your account, contact the <a href="mailto:contact@igpmanager.com">Support Team</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you remove information from your profile or delete your account,
                copies of that information may remain viewable to the extent it has been
                shared with others or was copied or stored by other users. However, if you
                delete your account, your name will no longer be associated with that
                information on the Game. For example, if you post something to another
                user's profile and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but
                be attributed to another name, such as "Unknown".
            </p>
            <p>
                Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies but will not
                be available to any second or third-party organisations. We may retain your
                Account information for a reasonable period of time afterwards for the
                purposes for internal account management and fraud prevention activities.
            </p>
