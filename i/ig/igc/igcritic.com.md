PII, as used in the United States and International privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. Throughout this agreement words such as ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ or ‘igcritic.com’ refer to More Click Media Ltd, registered International Business Company, Seychelles.

## What personal information do we collect from visitors to our website and/or app?

### Personally Identifiable Information

IGCRITIC.COM collects personal information during (i) personal profile, contest or sweepstakes registration; (ii) subscription registration for services that require a subscription; (iii) certain surveys or polls conducted on our web site.  Personal information includes, among other things, a user’s name, date of birth, gender, email address or other internet address (collectively referred to as ‘personal information’).

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

In addition to the use of personal information to operate the site, IGCRITIC.COM may also gather non-personally identifiable information, which may be used by More Click Media Ltd. Generally ‘non-personally identifiable information’ means information that is collected through ‘traffic data’ and may entail the use of ‘cookies’, ‘IP addresses’ or other numeric codes used to identify a computer or monitor how a user accesses a site. This non-personally identifiable information helps us determine how our customers use the site so that we can improve our site and ensure it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of our users as possible. We also provide statistical ‘ratings’ information to our partners about how our users collectively, use the site. We do this so that they too can understand how people use our site in order for them to make business decisions directed towards providing you, the user, with the best possible experience. This information is also used to generate advertising rates and may be shared with advertisers, sponsors, and other IGCRITIC.COM corporate partners. We may also provide an advertising partner insight as to how long a user views a page to better determine relevant advertising content.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act

We uphold the California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”) which is the first state law in the United States to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The laws’ reach stretches well beyond California and requires a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites which collect personally identifiable information from Californian consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly what information is being collected and with whom it is being shared and to comply with this policy. Our users can learn more at: <http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf>

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

  * users can visit our site anonymously
  * this privacy policy can be found in our footer and is available on the first significant page after entering our website
  * our privacy policy can easily be found and includes the word ‘privacy’
  * users are able to change their personal information by emailing us



## Children Online Privacy Protection Act

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the United States consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do in order to protect children’s privacy and safety online. More importantly, some games and advertisements represented on our website may not be suitable for children under the age of 13 years. Parental guidance is advised for all children under the age of 13 years.

## Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to comply with the Fair Information Practices Principles, should a data breach occur, we will take responsive action by notifying our users via email within 7 business days. We also agree to the individual redress principle which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires, not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

## CAN-SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them and spells out tough penalties for violations. Our vendor will collect your email address in order to market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our users with relevant website content.

In accordance with the CAN-SPAM Act we agree to the following:

  * to NOT use false or misleading subjects or email addresses
  * to identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way
  * to include the physical address of our business or site headquarters
  * to monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
  * to honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly
