This privacy policy applies only to transactions and activities you engage in, and data gathered, on the Site. Please review this privacy policy from time to time as it may be modified without notice. Each time you visit the Site or provide the Network with information, by doing so you are agreeing to the terms of this privacy policy at that time. 

**1\. Collection of Information.**

**1.1 Survey Information.**  
The Network collects information from individuals when such individuals voluntarily complete surveys, order forms, send an email through the the Site's referral engine technology or submit information via online forms which may or may not be accompanied by a pre-checked or non-pre-checked checkbox indicating that such individuals consent to receiving marketing communications from the Site or registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (each, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the websites and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, via postal mail, telephones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, the Network or a third party may ask individuals to provide various information which may include their name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education level, marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (collectively, "Survey Information"). Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to the Network or any third party, but individuals may receive incentives from the Network or a third party in exchange for providing Survey Information to the Network. 

**1.2 Other Information.**  
Other occasions when the Network obtains information from individuals include when such individuals (1) make a claim for a prize or seek to redeem an incentive offered by the Network or a third party, (2) request assistance through the Network's customer service department, and (3) voluntarily subscribe to a Network service or newsletter (collectively, "Other Information"). 

**1.3 Cookies, Web beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology.**  


**(a) Case's Ladder uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to the Site and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by the domain server that issued you the cookie. Case's Ladder uses cookies to store your preferences and enhance your online experience. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not have access to certain areas of the Site that depend on cookies. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. .**

 **

**(b) Third Party Cookies.** **  **The Network sends to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use the Site. However, it also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site's web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks the Network to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  As always remember, the Network only authorize certain third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting.  The third-party ad servers do not collect, nor does the Network give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must visit each ad network.s web site individual and opt out (if they offer this capability.) 

**(c) Web beacons.** Web beacons are graphic images, often transparent and no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that are placed on a Web site or in an e-mail. Web beacons are used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or opening the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, it simultaneously can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values. The Network, or third parties acting on the its behalf, may utilize Web beacons on Web pages or in email for any legally permissible purpose. 

**(d) General Behavior Tracking.** The Network may track online behaviors ("Behaviors") through its own technologies, including its desktop software products, in order to increase the effectiveness of the advertisements it delivers. Examples of such behaviors may include advertisement responses, websites that individuals visit, and products that individuals purchase. Individuals can prevent the tracking of Behaviors by globally unsubscribing from the Network's marketing materials. The Network reserves the right to use such technologies for any purpose permitted by law. 

**(e) Information Automatically Collected.** For site maintenance, optimization, security and other legally permissible purposes, the Network's servers (or third party servers) may collect certain information about website visitors automatically. Such information may include such visitors' IP address, browser type, date, time and duration of visit and particular pages viewed, and such other information as is permitted by law. 

**(f) New Technology.** The use of technology on the Internet is rapidly evolving, as is the Network's use of new technology. As previously stated, Network reserves the right to change this policy at any time without any additional notice to the user. As a result, the Network strongly encourages individuals to revisit this privacy policy from time to time for any updates regarding its use of technology.

**1.7 Credit Card Information.** The Network may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Network. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to the Network, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
