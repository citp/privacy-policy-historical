PRIVACY POLICY

eUniverse, Inc. ([http://www.euniverse.com](http://www.euniverse.com/)), is a network of entertainment-focused commerce, community, interactive and editorial Web sites (referred to hereafter as "the eUniverse Network," or "Network" for short). The information collected from users of the various sites comprising the eUniverse Network, and the manner in which that information is used, may vary slightly from site to site depending on the nature of the site and the chosen level of involvement of the user. Nevertheless, the information contained in this policy, and eUniverse's respect for its users' privacy in general, is uniformly applicable across the Network.

**_What information is collected by eUniverse and how is this information used?_**

We automatically collect and store the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet; the date and time you access one of our sites; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to a site in the Network. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the sites in the Network and to different sections of a site, to better develop the Network sites to address our users' preferences and to attract new users, and, in some instances, to properly credit third-parties who refer users to a site in the Network. 

Users of sites in the Network are often able to enter contests, sign up to receive or send electronic newsletters, greetings and other emails (such as weekly jokes), become members, play games, and participate in chat rooms. To provide these services to our users, we generally request that the user provide no more than a name and an email address. We do not require any of our users to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. We use the information collected to distribute the requested newsletter or other content, to notify contest winners, to enable password protected access to certain services and sections within sites on the Network, and to provide whatever other service the user has authorized in providing the contact information.

Several of the Network sites offer you the opportunity to purchase products, such as music CDs, video games and VHS and DVD movies. To complete a transaction, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and credit card expiration date. Once entered, this information is usually saved by the e-commerce site. When you choose to make future purchases through an eUniverse e-commerce site, this information automatically appears in the appropriate spaces on the web page within the site for placing orders.

Occasionally, eUniverse may poll the users of its sites and request background information from its users such as address, age range, gender, occupation, interests, hobbies, etc. The provision of any such information is always voluntary and never unnecessarily a condition of access or use. The information collected in user polls is solely for the internal purpose of letting eUniverse know who its users are and what they like in order to be better able to serve them. User poll information is only maintained and released by eUniverse, if at all, in aggregate statistical fashion and never in any manner that would allow for personal identification of a particular user. 

**_Does eUniverse disclose this information to anyone?_**

From time to time, an eUniverse Network site may notify registered users of product or service offerings that certain registered users may find of interest. Additionally, when communicating with users or responding to requests for mailings and other opt-in features, Network sites may include third-party advertisements, offers or promotions. If a request for mailing or other opt-in feature is to be provided by a third-party, the site will provide your name and email address to the third-party per the request or opt-in, and such mailings will typically include other relevant, third-party advertisements. Network sites always provide users the opportunity to opt out of receiving any promotional offerings or other mailings.

Otherwise, eUniverse does not sell, trade, lease or distribute the personal information of its registered users. However, eUniverse may release this information if required by law, to enforce eUniverse's terms of service, or to protect the rights, property or safety of eUniverse, its registered users, or others. Please note that eUniverse's privacy policy does not cover the web sites or web pages that link to the eUniverse Network of sites and services. 

**_How does eUniverse protect this information?_**

All transmissions of user information are through eUniverse's secure computer servers which, for e-commerce sites, also run authentication and data encryption software. Access to registered users' accounts on Network sites is password protected. 

**_How do we handle individually identifiable information collected from children under the age of 13 years old?_**

In general, the eUniverse Network is comprised of general interest/audience sites and is not directed at children under the age of 13. eUniverse Network sites do not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children 12 or under and actively discourage children from providing such information at points of collection.

For any Network sites which may be directed at children 12 or under and which knowingly collect personally identifying information from those children (such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child) there exist parental notice and/or consent features consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. In short, and depending on the nature and intended use of the information at issue, sites collecting personally identifying information from children either 1) send a notice to the parents or legal guardian of the child that informs the parent what information was collected, what contact has been, and/or will be, made, and that the parent may require deletion of such information and cessation of any contact, or 2) inform parents or a legal guardian that we wish to collect personal information from the child, that a parent's or legal guardian's verifiable consent is required for the collection, use and disclosure of the information, and how the parent can provide consent.

A parent or legal guardian has the option to agree to the collection and use of the child's information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties. We send a new notice and request for consent to parents and legal guardians if there are material changes in the collection, use or disclosure practices to which the parent or legal guardian had previously agreed. 

We do not send a notice to parents or legal guardians prior to collection of a child's email address for the following activities:

  * Contest entries; 
  * One-time online newsletter requests (parents are notified prior to future deliveries of the newsletter and given an opportunity to consent); 
  * Electronic postcard or other e-greeting deliveries; 
  * Providing notice and seeking consent to collect a child's or parent's email address; or 
  * Responding to a one-time request from a child and then deleting the email address. 

At any time, a parent or legal guardian may revoke his/her consent or refuse to allow us further use of his/her child's personal information and request that we delete the information. Effecting such a request can be accomplished using the contact information provided on the relevant Network site. Please note that a site may terminate any service provided to the child if the deleted information at issue is reasonably necessary for the child's participation in that activity.
