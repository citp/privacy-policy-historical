				<h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
<p class="standfirst">Your privacy is important to us. This statement outlines IG Markets' policy on how we manage the personal information we hold about our customers, shareholders and others. It applies to all organisations in the IG group of companies.</p>
<p>It is IG Markets' policy to respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals. IG Markets is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Commonwealth Privacy Act.</p>
<p>IG Markets' Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment. Any information we hold will be governed by the most current IG Privacy Policy Statement.</p>
<h3>IG Markets' privacy policy is based on openness</h3>
<p>We are committed to being open about how we use personal information. Where our documents ask for personal information, we will generally state the purposes for its use and to whom it may be disclosed.</p>
<h3>Why does IG Markets collect personal information?</h3>
<p>Our business is to meet our customers' needs for a range of financial services. To do this effectively, we need to collect certain personal information.</p>
<h3>What kind of personal information do we ask for?</h3>
<p>Because of the nature of the products and services provided, government regulations and taxation laws, we ask for a range of personal information from our customers. The type of personal information we may collect can include (but is not limited to) name, address, date of birth, contact details, income, assets and liabilities, account balances, trading statements, tax and financial statements and employment details.</p>
<p>We obtain most of the information directly from our customers through application or other forms, and from maintaining records of information provided in the course of ongoing customer service. We may also obtain information from other sources.</p>
<p>We may ask for other information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research, surveys or special offers) to enable us to improve our service or consider the wider needs of our customers or potential customers.</p>
<p>If you choose not to provide the information we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.</p>
<h3>How do we use this information and who may we disclose it to?</h3>
<p>While we may send you marketing material from time to time that we think will be useful to you, we are conscious of the need to respect your privacy.</p>
<p>Unless you are informed otherwise, the personal information we hold is used for establishing and managing your account, reviewing your ongoing needs, enhancing customer service and products and giving you ongoing information or opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you.</p>
<p>Depending on the product or service concerned and particular restrictions on sensitive information, this means that personal information may be disclosed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>other companies within the IG group (including associated companies in the United Kingdom) who provide financial and other services service providers and specialist advisers to IG Markets who have been contracted to provide IG Markets with administrative, financial, insurance, research or other services 
</li><li>credit providers, courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities as agreed or authorised by law 
</li><li>credit reporting or reference agencies </li></ul>anyone authorised by an individual, as specified by that individual or the contract
<p>Generally, we require that organisations outside the IG group of companies who handle or obtain personal information as service providers to IG Markets acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual's right to privacy and comply with the National Privacy Principles and this policy.</p>
<h3>Sensitive information is subject to greater restrictions</h3>
<p>Some personal information we hold is sensitive. The way we use tax statements and information received from a credit reporting agency about an individual may also be restricted by law.</p>
<p>Sensitive information may be relevant to credit and other applications. It is IG Markets' policy that sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purposes for which it was provided, unless the customer agrees otherwise or the use or disclosure of this information is allowed by law.</p>
<h3>Management of personal information</h3>
<p>IG Markets trains its employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals. IG Markets regards breaches of your privacy very seriously and will impose appropriate penalties, including dismissal.</p>
<p>IG Markets has an appointed Privacy Officer to ensure that our management of personal information is in accordance with this statement and the Privacy Act.</p>
<h3>How do we store personal information?</h3>
<p>Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, mail, over the internet or other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>We may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. However, when we consider information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records.</p>
<h3>How do we keep personal information accurate and up-to-date?</h3>
<p>IG Markets endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate and up-to-date. We realise that this information changes frequently with changes of address and other personal circumstances. We can generally update your customer information over the telephone.</p>
<h3>You have the right to check what personal information about you is held by us</h3>
<p>Under the Commonwealth Privacy Act, you have the right to obtain a copy of any personal information which IG Markets holds about you and to advise IG Markets of any perceived inaccuracy. The Act does set out some exceptions to this.</p>
<p>To make a request, you will need to complete an application form verifying your identity and specifying what information you require.</p>
<p>We will acknowledge your request within 14 days and respond promptly to it. We may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying the application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material requested. If the information sought is extensive, we will advise the likely cost in advance and can help to refine your request if required.</p>
<h3>What if you have a complaint?</h3>
<p>If you consider that any action of IG Markets breaches this Privacy Policy Statement or the National Privacy Principles or otherwise doesn't respect your privacy, you can make a complaint. This will be acted upon promptly. To make a complaint, please telephone us on (03) 9860 1711.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint, you can telephone the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner's hotline on 1300 363 992.</p>
