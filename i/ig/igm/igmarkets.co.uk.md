# IG Markets - Privacy Notice

Privacy Notice

  
Your privacy is important to us. This statement outlines IG Markets' policy on how we manage the personal information we hold about our customers, shareholders and others. It applies to all organisations in the IG group of companies.

It is IG Markets' policy to respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals. IG Markets is bound by the Data Protection Principles contained in the Data Protection Act 1998.

IG Markets' Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment. Any information we hold will be governed by the most current IG Privacy Policy Statement.

  
Our business is to meet our customers' needs for a range of financial services. To do this effectively, we need to collect certain personal information.

  
The type of personal information we may collect can include (but is not limited to) name, address, date of birth, contact details, income, assets and liabilities, account balances, trading statements, tax and financial statements and employment details.

We obtain most of the information directly from our customers through application or other forms, and from maintaining records of information provided in the course of ongoing customer service. We may also obtain information from other sources.

We may ask for other information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research, surveys or special offers) to enable us to improve our service or consider the wider needs of our customers or potential customers.

If you choose not to provide the information we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.

  
While we may send you marketing material from time to time that we think will be useful to you, we are conscious of the need to respect your privacy.

Unless you are informed otherwise, the personal information we hold is used for establishing and managing your account, reviewing your ongoing needs, enhancing customer service and products and giving you ongoing information or opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you.

Depending on the product or service concerned and particular restrictions on sensitive information, this means that personal information may be disclosed to:

» other companies within the IG group who provide financial and other services   
» service providers and specialist advisers to IG Markets who have been contracted to provide IG Markets with administrative, financial, insurance, research or other services  
» introducing brokers with whom we have a mutual relationship (any of whom may be within or outside the European Economic Area)  
» credit providers, courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities as agreed or authorised by law   
» credit reporting or reference agencies   
» anyone authorised by an individual, as specified by that individual or the contract 

Generally, we require that organisations outside the IG group of companies who handle or obtain personal information as service providers to IG Markets acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual's right to privacy and comply with the Data Protection Principles and this policy.

 **Management of personal information**  
IG Markets trains its employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals. IG Markets regards breaches of your privacy very seriously and will impose appropriate penalties, including dismissal.

IG Markets has an appointed Privacy Officer to ensure that our management of personal information is in accordance with this statement and the Privacy Act.

  
Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, mail, over the internet or other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

We may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. However, when we consider information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records.

  
IG Markets endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate and up-to-date. We realise that this information changes frequently with changes of address and other personal circumstances. We can generally update your customer information over the telephone.

  
Under the Data Protection Act, you have the right to obtain a copy of any personal information which IG Markets holds about you and to advise IG Markets of any perceived inaccuracy. The Act does set out some exceptions to this.

To make a request, please write to us, verifying your identity and specifying what information you require.

We may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying the application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material requested. We will acknowledge your request and respond to it within 40 days of receipt of your application and any applicable fee.

  
If you consider that any action of IG Markets breaches this Privacy Policy Statement or the Data Protection Principles or otherwise doesn't respect your privacy, you can make a complaint. This will be acted upon promptly. To make a complaint, please telephone us on 020 7896 0011.

If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint, you can telephone the Information Commissioner's information and enquiries line on 01625 545 745.
