        <td valign="middle">We collect several types of Personal Information about our guests.
          We don’t require Personal Information to access our site. However,
          if you prefer not to disclose Personal Information, you will not be
          able to enjoy certain features of our site.
          <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
          <p>Much of the Personal Information we collect comes directly from
            our web guests. Typically, this information includes name, credit
            card number, postal and email address, telephone, cell and facsimile
            number. Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal
            information (known as demographic information) such as your gender,
            age, date of birth, country, favorite video game, and gaming platform.
            This demographic information may be associated with your Personal
            Information and will be used to communicate with you. </p>
          <p><strong>We collect Personal Information from our web guests to:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Register
                for the Service</li>
            <li>Register for Game Centers</li>
            <li>Register for iGames Communities</li>
            <li>Participate in Events</li>
            <li>Promotions, surveys, or questionnaires</li>
            <li>Questions and Customer
                Support</li>
          </ol>          <p><strong>Events. </strong>Game center members have the ability to initiate events,
            including tournaments, through the Service. To create such events
            through the Service, iGames requires Personal Information from the
            sponsoring game center. If gamer members wish to participate in such
            events, they will be required to provide certain Personal Information
            and may be asked to provide additional, optional, information. In
            addition, if the event is one for which iGames rankings are available
            (this is disclosed at the time of registration), iGames will collect
            the results of the event and incorporate them into the iGames rankings
            for the particular games. The rankings will indicate the relative
            standing of each participant for the particular game.</p>
          <p><strong>Promotions.</strong> We may occasionally run optional contests, surveys,
            or other special promotions on the Service in which we ask participants
            for Personal Information or demographic information (like a zip code,
            age or favorite video game). We may use the data we collect in these
            contests and promotions to send you promotional material about iGames
            or third parties. Your Personal Information collected from these
            contests and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary
            and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes,
            but only under the terms and conditions specified when you take part
            in the promotion.</p>
          <p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to
            the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our
            legitimate business objectives.</p>
          <p><strong>Business Information</strong></p>
          <p>For practical reasons, we treat Personal Information submitted to
            us in a business capacity different from information we receive in
            a non-business capacity. Personal Information submitted to us in
            a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties,
            depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>
          <p><strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong></p>
          <p>We collect information through technology to make our sites more
            interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one
            of our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often
            associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet,
            like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your
            university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.
            At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding
            the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites.
            We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong>Network Advertisers</strong></p>
          <p>Many advertisements are managed and placed on our website by third
            parties. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network
            advertisers who place advertisements on </p>
          our website may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally
          identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over
          one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information
          is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information
          from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites
          and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you
          have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser.
          Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our
          Web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the
          privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your Personal Information
          will be handled on their site.
          <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
          <p>Our website also uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information
            that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website.
            We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For
            example, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies
            provide information to the site so that the site will remember who
            you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time
            a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
            You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or
            Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different,
            so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify
            your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many
            features that make your web experience smoother, like the features
            mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.</p>
          <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
          <p>Our websites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes,
            including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that
            are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. We also use these
            technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web sites,
            such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of
            our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission
            of information either directly to us or to another party authorized
            by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical
            methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether
            our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those
            e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may
          be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>

        <td valign="middle">As described in detail below, iGames may use your Personal Information
          in many ways, including contacting you, sending you promotional materials,
          and sharing your information with third parties so that these third
          parties can send you promotional materials. By “promotional materials,” we
          mean communications that directly promote the use of our website, or
          the purchase of products or services. As outlined below in A4, you
          may "opt-out" of certain uses of your Personal Information
          <p><strong>Game Centers.</strong> If you are a member gamer and you indicate, when registering
            or by updating your account information, that you have a “home
            game center” which is a member of iGames, then we will provide
            to that game center Personal Information about you so that game center
            may contact you about its activities, promotions, and other matters
            which they believe may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p>If you participate in an event sponsored by a particular game center
            member, your Personal Information will be provided to such game center
            in order to operate the event and report the results. That game center
            also may use your Personal Information to contact you about its other
            activities, promotions and other matters which they believe may be
            of interest to you.</p>
          <p>Each game center member has agreed that it may only use the Personal
            Information it receives from iGames in a manner consistent with this
            Privacy Policy. However, iGames is unable to guarantee that this
            will be the case. If you don’t want your Personal Information
            provided to a game center, then do not designate a “home game
            center,” and do not participate in game center sponsored events.</p>
          <p><strong>Game Publishers, Advertisers, Etc.</strong> We collect Personal Information
          and disclose it in an aggregate (non-personally identifiable) manner
            to game publishers, advertisers, and other third parties for marketing
            and promotional purposes. We also share this aggregate information
            to enable these companies to understand the number and composition
            of the iGames members and their use of our Service. In these situations,
            we don’t disclose to these entities any Personal Information.
            However, if you respond to ads provided by an advertiser they may
            assume that you fit a certain demographic profile based on the aggregate
            information provided to them. In addition, when you click on a banner
            ad, you should be aware that the advertiser may be collecting information
            from you.</p>
          <p><strong>Operational Uses</strong></p>
          <p>We may also use your Personal Information for other purposes such
            as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information
            to send you administrative communications either about your account
            with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes
            to this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Finally, we may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally
            identifiable, either by combining it with information about other
            individuals (aggregating your information with information about
            other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your
            name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing
            your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions
            apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize
            your Personal Information, and we may use and share in any way with
            third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more
            of our businesses and your Personal Information may be transferred
            as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the
            Personal Information received with that business would be treated
            in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and
            permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions
            in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal
            Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including
            any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph
            will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
          <p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the
            Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others </strong></p>
          <p>We will disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith
            that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example,
            to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce
            our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game
            rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and
            security of property that belongs to you; or protect the safety and

            information to contact you about promotional materials, product information

    <p><strong>Welcome to iGames!</strong></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><br>
      iGames has developed its website with the goal of creating an enjoyable
      experience for all users. This Kids Privacy Statement is designed to answer
      your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles with respect
      to children under the age of 13.</p>
    <p>Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide
      additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which this
      Kids' Privacy Statement is posted. We explain those additional protections
      in this Kids' Privacy Statement.</p>
    <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires
      that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and
      disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and
      that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children
      under 13 years of age to use certain features of our website. Below we
      explain how we do that for these “kids.” Also, when we use
      the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Statement and the certification seal shown on this page confirms
      that iGames is a valid member in <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy.asp" target="_blank" class="bodylink">ESRB’s Privacy Online Program</a>. ESRB’s
      Privacy Online Program is designed to alleviate consumers’ privacy
      concerns by ensuring a website’s information disclosure practices
      are responsible and appropriate. </p>

        <td valign="middle"><p>Kids can surf iGames’ site, view content,
            and enjoy many features without any personal information being collected.
            We don’t collect personal information from kids unless they
            register on iGames’ site. Typically, kids will register to
            participate in the iGames community or engage in promotional activities
            (contests, newsletters, or surveys) or other special activities.
            As part of the registration process, we collect basic contact information
            from kids: child’s and parent’s name and e-mail address.
            We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from
            kids during our registration process. </p>
                <p>Once a child is registered, we may collect demographic information
                  (date of birth, gender, and preferences) and combine it with
                  the child’s personal information. iGames will only collect
                  this information if it is voluntarily properly submitted to
                  us by either the child or parent.</p>
                <p>Note that all commercial sites directed to children under
                  13 are prohibited by U.S. law from conditioning a kid's participation
                  in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal
                  information than is reasonably necessary.</p>
                <p>Some areas of our website offer features that allow kids to
                  submit personal information (e.g., email address) without first
                  disclosing their age or obtaining verifiable parental consent.
                  These areas of our website provide services in a way that do
                  not require prior verifiable parental consent.</p>
                <p>Finally, we may collect demographic information about a kid.
                  For example, if a kid participates in a survey, we may collect
                  those responses. Among them, we may collect age, gender, hobbies,
                  and interests or other demographic information about gaming
                  and preferences. We also use some passive technologies, including
                  cookies and web beacons, to monitor traffic on our websites.
                  This demographic information may be associated with a child’s
                personal information.</p>

                    personal information from parents to allow kids to participate
                    in certain activities offered on our website and through
                    game center members. These activities may include contests,
                    promotional information about new products and features,
                special offers, and other interesting events.</p>
                <p>Other website features include e-mail, newsletters, news postings,
                  events (such as game showcases and tournaments) at member game
                  centers, promotions and other similar activities. In the course
                  of a kid's participation in these features, a kid may also
                  provide us additional information about himself or herself.
                  If a parent allows us to collect personal information about
                  their kid, we may link certain information collected through
                  technology (see the "Information Collected Through Technology" section
                  of A2 of our General Privacy Policy) to that personal information.</p>
                <p>If a kid registers on the iGames website to participate in
                  an event sponsored by a particular game center member, the
                  kid’s name and email address will be provided to such
                  game center in order to operate the event and report the results.
                  That game center also may the kid’s personal information
                  to contact the kid about its other activities, promotions and
                  other matters which they believe may be of interest.</p>
                <p>To protect kids, iGames will not allow children to select
                  a “home” game center (which automatically provides
                  the game center with the information collected during player
                  registration). </p>
                <p>We may use the information that we collect from and about
                  kids for our business purposes, including record-keeping, transaction
                  fulfillment, and marketing. The contact information gathered
                  from a kid is used to obtain consent to our information collection
                  from their parents.</p>
                <p>After registration, contact information may also be used to
                  notify users of promotional activities such as contests, sweepstakes,
                  newsletters or new products, or functional changes to our website
                  or privacy policy. Finally, we may use personal and demographic
                  information for our internal marketing and study ways to better
                  improve our services.</p>
                <p>If a kid wins a contest, we notify the parent at the email
                  address provided to us during the registration process, and
                  request that the parent provide his or her postal address for
                  purposes of delivering the prize. We may publish a winner’s
                  first name, city, and state of residence on our web site.</p>
                <p>From time to time, iGames may share kids’ personal information
                  with outside entities hired to assist with internal website
                  support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email
                  services, or technical support). These entities will not use
                  kids’ personal information for any other purpose, and
                  have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and
                  integrity of all the personal information they obtain from
                  us. </p>
            <p>We don’t share any information about a kid with any
