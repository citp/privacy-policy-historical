        <td valign="middle">We collect several types of Personal Information about our guests.
          We don’t require Personal Information to access our site. However,
          if you prefer not to disclose Personal Information, you will not be
          able to enjoy certain features of our site.
          <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
          <p>Much of the Personal Information we collect comes directly from
            our web guests. Typically, this information includes name, credit
            card number, postal and email address, telephone, cell and facsimile
            number. Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal
            information (known as demographic information) such as your gender,
            age, date of birth, country, favorite video game, and gaming platform.
            This demographic information may be associated with your Personal
            Information and will be used to communicate with you.</p>
          <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
		  We don’t knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13.  We 
		  take steps to ensure that those who wish to register Personal Information on 
		  our website meet certain age requirements before they can proceed with registration. 
		  We take kids' privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their 
		  child’s online activities. 
          <p><strong>We collect Personal Information from our web guests to:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Register
                for the Service</li>
            <li>Register for game centers</li>
            <li>Register for iGames communities</li>
            <li>Participate in events, promotions, surveys, or questionnaires </li>
            <li>Respond to questions and provide customer
                support</li>
          </ol>          
          <p><strong>Events. </strong>iGame and game center members have the ability to initiate events,
            including tournaments, through the Service. To create such events
            through the Service, iGames requires Personal Information from the
            sponsoring game center. If gamer members wish to participate in such
            events, they will be required to provide certain Personal Information
            and may be asked to provide additional, optional, information which may be 
			distributed to host game centers and other sponsors. In
            addition, if the event is one for which iGames rankings are available
            (this is disclosed at the time of registration), iGames will collect
            the results of the event and incorporate them into the iGames rankings
            for the particular games. The rankings will indicate the relative
            standing of each participant for the particular game.</p>
          <p><strong>Promotions.</strong> We may occasionally run optional contests, surveys,
            or other special promotions on the Service in which we ask participants
            for Personal Information or demographic information (like a zip code,
            age or favorite video game). We may use the data we collect in these
            contests and promotions to send you promotional material about iGames
            or third parties. Your Personal Information collected from these
            contests and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary
            and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes,
            but only under the terms and conditions specified when you take part
            in the promotion.</p>
          <p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to
            the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our
            legitimate business objectives.</p>
          <p><strong>Business Information</strong></p>
          <p>For practical reasons, we treat Personal Information submitted to
            us in a business capacity different from information we receive in
            a non-business capacity. Personal Information submitted to us in
            a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties,
            depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>
          <p><strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong></p>
          <p>We collect information through technology to make our sites more
            interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one
            of our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often
            associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet,
            like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your
            university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.
            At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding
            the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites.
            We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong>Network Advertisers</strong></p>
          <p>Many advertisements are managed and placed on our website by third
            parties. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network
            advertisers who place advertisements on our website may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally
          identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over
          one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information
          is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information
          from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites
          and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you
          have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser.
          Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our
          Web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the
          privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your Personal Information
          will be handled on their site.          </p>
          <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
          <p>Our website also uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information
            that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website.
            We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For
            example, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies
            provide information to the site so that the site will remember who
            you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time
            a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
            You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or
            Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different,
            so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify
            your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many
            features that make your web experience smoother, like the features
            mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.</p>
          <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
          <p>Our websites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes,
            including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that
            are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. We also use these
            technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web sites,
            such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of
            our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission
            of information either directly to us or to another party authorized
            by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical
            methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether
            our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those
            e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may
          be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>

        <td valign="middle">As described in detail below, iGames may use your Personal Information
          in many ways, including contacting you, sending you promotional materials,
          and sharing your information with third parties so that these third
          parties can send you promotional materials. By “promotional materials,” we
          mean communications that directly promote the use of our website, or
          the purchase of products or services. As outlined below in A4, you
          may "opt-out" of certain uses of your Personal Information.
          <p><strong>Game Centers.</strong> If you are a member gamer and you indicate, when registering
            or by updating your account information, that you have a “home
            game center” which is a member of iGames, then we will provide
            to that game center Personal Information about you so that game center
            may contact you about its activities, promotions, and other matters
            which they believe may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p>If you participate in an event sponsored by a particular game center
            member, your Personal Information will be provided to such game center
            in order to operate the event and publicly report the results. That game center
            also may use your Personal Information to contact you about its other
            activities, promotions and other matters which they believe may be
            of interest to you.</p>
          <p>Each game center member has agreed that it may only use the Personal
            Information it receives from iGames in a manner consistent with this
            Privacy Policy. However, iGames is unable to guarantee that this
            will be the case. If you don’t want your Personal Information
            provided to a game center, then do not designate a “home game
            center,” and do not participate in game center sponsored events.</p>
          <p><strong>Game Publishers, Advertisers, Etc.</strong> We collect Personal Information
          and demographic information and disclose it in an aggregate or non-personally identifiable manner
            to game publishers, advertisers, and other third parties for marketing
            and promotional purposes. We also share this aggregate or demographic information
            to enable these companies to understand the number and composition
            of the iGames members and their use of our Service. In these situations,
            we don’t disclose to these entities any Personal Information.
            However, if you respond to ads provided by an advertiser they may
            assume that you fit a certain demographic profile based on the aggregate
            information provided to them. In addition, when you click on a banner
            ad, you should be aware that the advertiser may be collecting information
            from you.</p>
          <p><strong>Operational Uses</strong></p>
          <p>We may also use your Personal Information for other purposes such
            as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information
            to send you administrative communications either about your account
            with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes
            to this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Finally, we may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally
            identifiable, either by combining it with information about other
            individuals (aggregating your information with information about
            other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your
            name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing
            your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions
            apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize
            your Personal Information, and we may use and share in any way with
            third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more
            of our businesses and your Personal Information may be transferred
            as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the
            Personal Information received with that business would be treated
            in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and
            permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions
            in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal
            Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including
            any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph
            will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
          <p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the
            Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others </strong></p>
          <p>We will disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith
            that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example,
            to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce
            our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game
            rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and
