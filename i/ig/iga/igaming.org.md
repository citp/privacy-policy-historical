# Privacy Policy

We understand what your privacy means to you and we believe it to be as sacred to us as it is to you. To use our wide range of services we do require our visitors to register and provide a bit of personal data and some information regarding your gaming and promotional preferences. But allow us to explain exactly how we gather, maintain and make use of your information:

**Data collection**

The **www.igaming.org** privacy policy applies to any and all information you submit during registration, via email and any other section of this website.

The registration process is quite simple and fast and you will supply personal information such as your name, email address, location, age and other contact details.

This information is used by **www.igaming.org** to better understand your needs and wants so that we may provide a better and more efficient informational service.

In some sections of our website you will have the option to share content (news, articles, promotions, etc.) with your friends and family. Here we will ask you for their names and email addresses just so we can share our content on your behalf.

In either cases where we ask or collect personal data, users will have a choice to opt-in to our mailers, draws and promotions. We will never send unsolicited material to you or referrals without proper authorization. Opting in and out of our mailers is easily done within your profile page. We also pledge never to sell, distribute or trade in part or as a whole any of the information submitted to us by any of our visitors and members.
