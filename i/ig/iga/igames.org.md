| **What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?**  
| We collect several types of Personal Information about our guests. We don’t require Personal Information to access our site. However, if you prefer not to disclose Personal Information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our site. 

**Information You Provide to Us**

Much of the Personal Information we collect comes directly from our web guests. Typically, this information includes name, credit card number, postal and email address, telephone, cell and facsimile number. Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your gender, age, date of birth, country, favorite video game, and gaming platform. This demographic information may be associated with your Personal Information and will be used to communicate with you.

**Children**

We don’t knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. We take steps to ensure that those who wish to register Personal Information on our website meet certain age requirements before they can proceed with registration. We take kids' privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their child’s online activities. 

**We collect Personal Information from our web guests to:**

  1. Register for the Service
  2. Register for game centers
  3. Register for iGames communities
  4. Participate in events, promotions, surveys, or questionnaires 
  5. Respond to questions and provide customer support



**Events.** iGame and game center members have the ability to initiate events, including tournaments, through the Service. To create such events through the Service, iGames requires Personal Information from the sponsoring game center. If gamer members wish to participate in such events, they will be required to provide certain Personal Information and may be asked to provide additional, optional, information which may be distributed to host game centers and other sponsors. In addition, if the event is one for which iGames rankings are available (this is disclosed at the time of registration), iGames will collect the results of the event and incorporate them into the iGames rankings for the particular games. The rankings will indicate the relative standing of each participant for the particular game.

**Promotions.** We may occasionally run optional contests, surveys, or other special promotions on the Service in which we ask participants for Personal Information or demographic information (like a zip code, age or favorite video game). We may use the data we collect in these contests and promotions to send you promotional material about iGames or third parties. Your Personal Information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion.

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**Business Information**

For practical reasons, we treat Personal Information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal Information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.

**Information Collected Through Technology**

We collect information through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.

**Network Advertisers**

Many advertisements are managed and placed on our website by third parties. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network advertisers who place advertisements on our website may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our Web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your Personal Information will be handled on their site. 

**Cookies**

Our website also uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

**Web Beacons**

Our websites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

| **How is your Personal Information used and shared?**  
| As described in detail below, iGames may use your Personal Information in many ways, including contacting you, sending you promotional materials, and sharing your information with third parties so that these third parties can send you promotional materials. By “promotional materials,” we mean communications that directly promote the use of our website, or the purchase of products or services. As outlined below in A4, you may "opt-out" of certain uses of your Personal Information. 

**Game Centers.** If you are a member gamer and you indicate, when registering or by updating your account information, that you have a “home game center” which is a member of iGames, then we will provide to that game center Personal Information about you so that game center may contact you about its activities, promotions, and other matters which they believe may be of interest to you.

If you participate in an event sponsored by a particular game center member, your Personal Information will be provided to such game center in order to operate the event and publicly report the results. That game center also may use your Personal Information to contact you about its other activities, promotions and other matters which they believe may be of interest to you.

Each game center member has agreed that it may only use the Personal Information it receives from iGames in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. However, iGames is unable to guarantee that this will be the case. If you don’t want your Personal Information provided to a game center, then do not designate a “home game center,” and do not participate in game center sponsored events.

**Game Publishers, Advertisers, Etc.** We collect Personal Information and demographic information and disclose it in an aggregate or non-personally identifiable manner to game publishers, advertisers, and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. We also share this aggregate or demographic information to enable these companies to understand the number and composition of the iGames members and their use of our Service. In these situations, we don’t disclose to these entities any Personal Information. However, if you respond to ads provided by an advertiser they may assume that you fit a certain demographic profile based on the aggregate information provided to them. In addition, when you click on a banner ad, you should be aware that the advertiser may be collecting information from you.

**Operational Uses**

We may also use your Personal Information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.

Finally, we may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your Personal Information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.

**Purchase or Sale of Businesses**

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your Personal Information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the Personal Information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.

**Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others**

We will disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; or protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.

| **What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information?**  
| Generally, you have control over the Personal Information you submit to us. 

We encourage iGames members to update and edit their contact information and keep it current. You can easily correct or update contact and account information, or delete optional information in the preferences menu at any time, by using your login and password to access your iGames account.

During registration, we also provide our game center members with the option to “Opt In” to having Personal Information shared with third parties so that those third parties may use your information to contact you about promotional materials, product information special offers, and other communications. The game center member must physically select to “Opt-In” either during the registration process or when updating their profile. To remove yourself from “Opt-In,” you must deselect this option from your profile page. 

If at any time you decide to remove your Personal Information from our database, you may do so by visiting the profile section of your iGames account or contacting us at [privacy@igames.org](mailto:privacy@igames.org). Even though your account will not be active, we may also retain your information in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request.

| **What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your Personal Information?**  
| 

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.

Your membership account is password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. If you are using a public computer or a shared computer, we strongly recommend that you sign out of your iGames account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from the computer.
