<a name="introduction"></a><h4>1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>IGN Entertainment, Inc., through itself and its subsidiaries (“IGN” or “we”), operates several websites, including, but not limited to, ign.com, au.ign.com, de.ign.com, uk.ign.com, my.ign.com (“My IGN”), gamespy.com, makingfun.com, fileplanet.com, teamxbox.com, cheatscodesguides.com, gamestats.com, whattheyplay.com and askmen.com (together, the “IGN Sites”), which provide a collection of online services, including, without limitation, various communication tools, online forums, social networking features, personalized content and branded programming, and any other features, content or applications offered from time to time by IGN in connection with IGN’s business, including when the IGN Sites are accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the “IGN Services”).  IGN is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.</p>
<p>As set forth in our <a href="http://corp.ign.com/user-agreement.html">User Agreement</a> the IGN Sites are general audience sites, are not targeted to children, and IGN does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all “users,” including both those who use some of the IGN Services without being registered and “Members” who have registered with IGN to create a profile, enter a sweepstakes or contest or otherwise participate in an activity on the IGN Services.  The Policy describes IGN’s collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the IGN Services.  It also describes generally IGN’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.</p>
<a name="submission"></a><h4>2.	SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON IGN SERVICES</h4>
<p>User Submitted Information</p>
<p>Registration Information is the information that users provide to IGN: (a) to register for certain IGN Services, for example, creating a profile, participating in sweepstakes, contests, surveys, or certain special initiatives, supplying user reviews, submitting game guides, or participating in chat rooms; or (b) to purchase products or services from or through the IGN Services. Registration Information may include one or more of the following: full name, email address, gender, date of birth, postal address, telephone number and credit card number.</p>
<p>My IGN Profile Content consists of information Members may choose to add to their My IGN profile, including a Member’s profile picture or avatar, user name, vanity URL, stated location, gender, online addresses or gamer profile (i.e., gaming name, clan affiliation, game play statistics, and the like and free-form content such as a Member’s Bio, stream, blog, friends, games, photo albums, videos, audio conversations, and similar information).  You can control which IGN users can post to or comment in your My IGN Profile Content by adjusting your <a href="http://my.ign.com/settings">My IGN Profile Settings</a>.  My IGN Profile Content is always public, which means it is available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the IGN Services and on external search engines.</p>
<p>Public Site Content consists of information you disclose in public areas of an IGN Site, such as the My IGN Profile Content, Member home pages, message boards, chat rooms and other community areas.  Please be aware that Public Site Content is always public and available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the IGN Services and on external search engines.</p>
<p>Correspondence consists of information you disclose when you contact IGN, for example, for customer service purposes.</p>
<p>IGN Collected Information</p>
<p>IGN Site Activity Information. When users access the IGN Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the IGN Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the IGN Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.  We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.  Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.  We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the IGN Services, including your actions while using the IGN Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, advertisements you have seen, as well as other anonymous, non-personally identifiable information.  IGN may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the IGN Sites to personal information obtained from you or a third party. For example, if you’ve asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the IGN Sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, we will not coordinate your personal information and cookie or click stream information in this manner without first obtaining your express affirmative consent.</p>
<p><a name="adchoices"></a>Third parties that support the IGN Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  IGN does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>).  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html</a>.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the IGN Services.</p>
<p>Third Parties.  To improve the quality of the IGN Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties.  If you access the IGN Services through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, or any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with partner services.</p>
<a name="notice"></a><h4>3.	NOTICE &amp; CHOICE</h4>
<p>Means of Notice.  This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which IGN provides you with notice about its collection and use of your personal information.   IGN will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission.</p>
<p>Privacy Policy Changes.  IGN may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary.  If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent through email or a prominent posting on the site.</p>
<p>Location of Data.  The IGN Services are hosted in the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to and processed in the United States.  U.S. data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.  As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p>Linked Websites or Services.  The IGN Services may also be linked to sites or services operated by IGN affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: “<a href="http://www.newscorp.com">Affiliated Companies</a>”) or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by third parties. IGN is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the IGN Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site.  Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html">Privacy Principles</a>, users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<a name="disclosure"></a><h4>4.	USE AND DISCLOSURE</h4>
<p>Information Made Public Through Use of IGN Services and User Privacy Settings</p>
<p>Public Site Content, including, without limitation, the My IGN Profile Content, is always publicly available to anyone, including other users, search engines, advertisers, third-party application developers, and anyone else with access to the IGN Services.  You control what information you add to your My IGN Profile Content.  You may also restrict which other IGN users can post content or comments to your My IGN Profile through your <a href="http://my.ign.com/settings">My IGN Profile Settings.</a></p>
<p>IGN’s Use and Disclosure of Information</p>
<p>We only share your non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties when we believe sharing is permitted by you or authorized by this Privacy Policy.  In addition, IGN may share your personal information with Affiliated Companies.</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from and about users for the following purposes:</p>
<p>To provide and manage the IGN Services.  We use the information we collect from and about users to provide the IGN Services and features to you including to measure and improve those services and features, to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, advertising and marketing messages, to allow you to participate in online games, contests or promotions, to enable you to communicate and share with other users, and to provide you with customer support and respond to inquiries.  We may use aggregated, anonymous data about use of and activity on the IGN Services to assist us in this regard and such data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>To allow third-party service providers to assist us in providing and managing the IGN Services.  IGN may make your non-public personal information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the IGN Services.  These outside service providers are required to protect non-public personal information entrusted to them and not use it for any other purpose than the specific service they are providing to IGN.</p>
<p>To allow other users to find you.  In order to locate My IGN Members that a user may already know in the physical world and/or want to get to know in the online world, IGN allows users to search for Members using information the user already knows, such as username, full name, or gamer profile, and identifies users matching that search information.</p>
<p>To deliver relevant advertising.  We may use the information you provide to us, and information we collect about your use of the IGN Services through cookies and other technologies, to assist us in delivering you relevant ads when you visit the IGN Services.  We may work with third-party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver these ads to you.  We do not share your non-public personal information with these third parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on the IGN Services. As noted above, these third-party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about third-party online advertising and to opt out of this type of advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<p>To contact you. IGN may periodically send promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications related to the IGN Services to the email address you provided to us at registration or to your account.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from IGN, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of as long as you are a Member, such as notifications of changes to the IGN Services or policies.</p>
<p>To protect the rights of IGN and our users.  There may be instances when IGN may disclose user information without providing notice or choice, including situations where IGN has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of IGN, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of users of the IGN Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.</p>
<p>To complete a merger or sale of assets.  If IGN sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, IGN may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>

<p>User Control.  To access, correct or update your account or other personal information such as your city or interests, please use the "My Account" link on the IGN Site on which you are registered.  You may unsubscribe from any premium IGN Service for which you have previously subscribed by following the instructions included in the IGN User Agreement: <a href="http://corp.ign.com/user-agreement.html">http://corp.ign.com/user-agreement.html</a>. Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances – where, for example, you have shared information with a third-party application or website.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.
