  1. **What Types of Information Do We Collect From You?**



**Personal Information**  is information that identifies you as an individual. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided by us (for example, to sign up to be a customer or to register for a webinar), we may require that you furnish Personal Information. We collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.

**Non-Personal Information**  is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you, including your MAC address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, demographic data (for example your country), as well as information collected through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our Site and our services. We and our third party service providers may also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other person, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the number of customers we have in a particular state.

**Cookies.**  We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and similar technologies on this Site. We use them to conduct analytics that help us understand how our Site is being utilized so that we can make it better. We also allow third parties to place cookies and collect Non-Personal Information. Some of these third parties provide functionality such as social networking or sharing functionality on the Site. Other third parties help us conduct Site analytics. While still other third parties may help collect information to be used to target advertising as described below. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. You can also delete the cookie we set for you. To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

**Third Party Advertisers.  **We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on the Site and/or on the sites on which we advertise. Please note that these companies may use information (not including Personal Information) about your visit to the applicable site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. In addition, we may use web beacons provided by third-party advertising companies to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Site.
