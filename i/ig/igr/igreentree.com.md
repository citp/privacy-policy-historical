Use of Registration Information

**

Our site's Candidate Self Service (CSS) registration area requires applicants to supply contact information, such as name and e-mail address, and demographic information, such as your ZIP code. We use this information to send you recruitment materials from our company. However, users may opt out of - or opt in to - these recruitment e-mail messages at any time. (See Opt Out/Opt In, below.)

We do not use collected demographic and profile data for any purpose other than recruitment.

From time to time, we may ask you to participate in an online survey. If this is the case, you will be required to supply contact and demographic information. Greentree uses this data to send you information about the company. We might use this information to contact you as necessary. However, you may opt out of or opt in to our mailings at any time. (See Opt Out/Opt In, below.)

Security

**

Greentree’s CSS features industry-leading encryption products to protect your personal data, including 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certification and 1024 Bit RSA public keys. Secure Sockets Layer, SSL, is the standard security technology for creating an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private and integral.
