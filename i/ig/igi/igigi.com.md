This Web site (this "Site") is operated by IGIGI, Inc. We recognize that privacy is a major concern for our customers (“customers”) and we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy is to advise you how we will and will not disclose the information provided to us through this Site.

This Privacy Policy applies to all information obtained through this Site.

**What information do we collect?**  
We collect information online when you register with us. This information includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and may include your phone number. We also may ask you for your mailing preferences should you choose to join our mailing list and/or Preferred Client Club and if you would like to participate in consumer research. When we conduct sales, we will also collect information necessary to complete the sale and process your order such as shipping address, credit card numbers (and expiration dates) and related information.

**How do we use your information?**  
IGIGI collects information from you to fulfill your orders and requests, and to communicate with you about our company, our affiliates and our products. In addition, we may use information about your product interests and purchases to help us improve our Site design and your online experience. 

We may combine information you provide with demographic information that is available from other sources. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your online experience with us, and to communicate more effectively with you by e-mail or otherwise. We will not share your information with anyone outside of IGIGI.

**How do we store and protect your information?**  
IGIGI uses industry-standard efforts including firewalls, data-encryption methods and password protected data sources to safeguard the confidentiality of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to reasonably safeguard and secure the information we collect. Sensitive data that we collect is encrypted before it travels over the Internet using industry standards for secure online transactions.

**Mailing lists**  
When you register with IGIGI or participate in a contest or promotion online through this Site you may choose to receive e-mails or postal mail from us regarding our company, corporate information, products, services, contests and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you e-mails to help us learn more about your online preferences.

**Disclosure or sharing information with unrelated third parties**  
IGIGI will not disclose any collected information with any and all unrelated third parties for the sake of commercial gain. In the event that IGIGI's or any of our affiliates' or subsidiaries' businesses or assets are sold, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. We may share customer information with law enforcement agencies in the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity with or without requiring a court order or a subpoena.

**Contests, quizzes, sweepstakes and consumer research**  
IGIGI may from time to time offer contests, quizzes and sweepstakes as part of our promotional events. Should you choose to participate in such an activity, we may publish your response.

We may also offer registered users the opportunity to participate in consumer research to assist us in such matters as Site development, navigation design and layout as well as product preferences and general feedback. Research projects may be managed and executed through unaffiliated third parties and, if you participate, your information may be disclosed to such third parties; however, individual responses to questions asked during actual studies will be maintained in confidence and disclosed only in an aggregate manner that is not personally identifiable.

**How do we protect children’s privacy?**  
Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, IGIGI will not knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.
