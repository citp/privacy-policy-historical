# iGive.com - Privacy Policy

**It is possible to utilize iSearchiGive.com without becoming an iGive.com member and without providing us your e-mail address. In that instance, any references to the collection or utilization of e-mail address and other information supplied by a user do not apply.**  


**How do iGive.com and iSearchiGive.com use the information collected?**

We will be utilizing your e-mail address to send you our newsletters and to alert you to special opportunities and offers. If you have given permission, we will also forward newsletters from your cause to you, and will let your cause know that you are supporting the cause with your online shopping.

We will disclose information that we gather only in the aggregate in order to analyze our usage and attract advertisers, corporate sponsors or merchant affiliates. We will take great care and caution to keep whatever information we gather safe.

Our referral program rewards the causes when members refer new shoppers to iGive.com through their personalized Tell-a-Friend links. If you join through such a link, your name is revealed to your referrer only if you give permission during registration. No other information is shared or revealed with the individual who referred you, or with any other party. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. iGive.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may [contact us](http://support.igive.com/Main/frmNewTicket.aspx) to request that we remove this information from our database.  


Please note that when a member visits or shops at our advertisers or with an iGive.com merchant or in the iGive.com Mall, they are dealing with another company, not iGive.com. This means that you enter into a relationship with that company / Web site separately from iGive.com. Any information you share with that advertiser or merchant is subject to their policies and practices, not to iGive.com's policies or practices. Members are encouraged to read the privacy policies of our merchant partners.

We do NOT collect or have any access to your credit card information. Stores do not share that information with us, either.

We do NOT collect or have any access to social security numbers. Generally, we do not collect or receive detail on your purchases. In some instances, you or a store will share purchase detail with us, but we do not retain that information.

**What security measures are taken to protect member and other information?**

Non-authorized personnel do not have physical access to our computers or database. Employees review security guidelines on a quarterly basis, as well as any time new policies are added. The servers that we use to store personally identifiable information are kept in a locked room at a secure facility which requires fingerprint authorization for entry.

**Are cookies or tracking pixels used by iGive.com?**

We and certain of our vendors use â€˜cookies' to make visiting our site and visiting iGive.com merchants a better, easier experience. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. This is done to allow us or our vendors to recognize you when you visit iGive.com, iGive.com merchants, and the iGive.com Mall. Cookies also make it easier for us to track your activity and purchases and to match them with your member registration and charity so that you and your selected cause receive the appropriate credit. We do not share this information with others.

Some iGive.com e-mails contain a transparent GIF file, also called a tracking pixel. If you choose to download the images within our e-mails, the tracking pixel will allow us to identify your web browser through a unique cookie, which allows us to know if and when you opened our e-mail. This information allows us to better understand which of our e-mails are resulting in traffic to iGive.com and our merchants. Information gained through pixel tracking is only shared in aggregate; we do not share personally identifiable information gathered through pixel tracking.
