certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the
European Union ("EU Personal Data"). i-Parcel complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe

Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data
from European Union member countries and Switzerland. i-Parcel has certified that it

        <br>
        <h3>Categories of Individual Data Subjects</h3>
        In general, i-Parcel may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about 
        several different types of individuals, including direct customers and customers 
        of i-parcel’s ecommerce merchant customers,. i-parcel’s practices with respect 
        to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.<br>
        <h3>DIRECT CUSTOMERS</h3>
        <p>i-Parcel generally collects, uses, and discloses information about direct 
            customers located in the EU or Switzerland in accordance with the Website 
            Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx" target="_blank">www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx</a>. 
            If you become a direct customer we will collect your name, company name, 
            shipping address, phone number and email address. We use this information to 
            contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest, provide you 
            with your login details, allow you to create invoices and shipments for your 
            clients, to send you service related emails, and to allow you to track your 
            packages until such time as they are de3livered to you. You have the ability to 
            upload shipment files to make it easier for you to create your shipments. These 
            are stored on our site for your own personal use. They must remain on our site 
            in order for us to satisfy record keeping requirements of U.S. Transportation 
            Security Administration, Office of Foreign Assets Control and other American and 
            foreign regulatory and compliance organizations.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>CUSTOMERS OF I-PARCEL’S ECOMMERCE MERCHANT CUSTOMERS</h3>
        <p>i-Parcel may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about of our clients. Such 
            data may include their names, company names, shipping addresses, phone numbers, 
            email addresses and complete descriptions of the goods ordered from i-parcel’s 
            clients. IParcel may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, 
            including to deliver or provide products or services; to establish or maintain 
            client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based and 
            e-commerce activities; to perform accounting functions, to satisfy exporting, 
            importing and other legal requirements of American and foreign regulatory and 
            compliance obligations; and to conduct other activities as necessary or 
            appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business 
            relationship. Employees and agents of our clients, business partners, and 
            suppliers may contact us if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they 
            would like to access and correct EU Personal Data that we maintain about them. 
            However, clients should contact the original ecommerce merchant where i-parcel’s 
            transaction originated to access and correct their own data. In any event, such 
            persons can also contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@i-parcel.com">privacy@i-parcel.com</a>, 
            or by using the information at the end of this privacy statement. Also, to the 
            extent that any of these individuals receive marketing communications from XYZ, 
            and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such communications, they

            email address if you wished to be notified about your tracking information.</p>
        We obtain information about end users of our clients who we have placed on a 
        Prohibited Parties List. This list has company names and addresses of end users 
        whom we will not deliver to. This information is used for no other purposes.<br>
        <h3>Clients</h3>
        <p>i-parcel provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business 
            clients ("Clients") that facilitate services including air carriage, customs 
            clearance and delivery for individuals ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, 
            i-Parcel may obtain access to EU Personal Data about such Data Subjects in the 
            course of providing the services and solutions. In other specific instances, 
            i-Parcel may also obtain access to data about our Clients' end users in the 
            course of providing support services to the Clients ("End Users"). Such data may 
            include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, full description of 
            products being transported, and other information, depending on the particular 
            Client and application at issue.</p>
        <p>Wherever we obtain access to EU Personal Data about Data Subjects or End Users, 
            we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we 
            therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions 
            and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them. If you are a an End User 
            with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the 
            Client's website to understand the privacy practices that apply to EU Personal 
            Data that we may maintain about you. Moreover, if you would like to access and 
            review your EU Personal Data, you should contact our Client with any such 
            requests. We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to 
            assist with such responses.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Other Necessary Disclosures</h3>

            necessary in connection with the performance of requested customs clearance or 
            delivery partners, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate 
            business need. i-Parcel may also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary in 
            connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these 
            situations, i-Parcel will require the recipient of the data to protect the data 
            in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbor, or otherwise take 
            steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data is appropriately protected. i-Parcel 
            may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where 
            i-Parcel believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law 
            enforcement request.</p>
