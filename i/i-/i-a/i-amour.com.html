            <br>
          To play games in i-Amour.com you do not need to give up any personal information. <br>

          <br>
          When  you register as a member at iZone, the community in i-Amour, we  collect Personal Information including your email address, first name,  last name, and birthday, or any information that is voluntarily  provided by you. <br>
          <br>
          We maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP  address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your  Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to personal  information. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on  our Web sites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of  abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>The way we use Personal Information</strong> <br>
          <br>

          Your email address is used by i-Amour to send information  about new services at i-Amour. We will not sell your email address to  any third party vendors. The information about age is mainly used to  identify minors that need to get permission from their parents or legal  guardian to become members at i-Amour.com (Minors in the US are  defined as children under 13, in non-US minors are defined as under 16  of age.) <br>
          <br>
          We reserve the right to collect and disclose (to our  affiliates and to non-affiliate third parties) user behavior and  Personal Information to the extent permitted by applicable law, as  specifically restricted below or in the Terms of Use. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or elsewhere, we  reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary  to satisfy any applicable law (including, without limitation, the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), regulation, legal process,  law enforcement requests, demands by parties claiming your infringement  of their rights or governmental request, to edit, refuse to post or  remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in our sole  discretion; or to act in an emergency to protect someone's safety or  legal rights. <br>
          <br>
          We have no control over third parties to whom you may give  Personal Information through the use of i-Amour.com. We use the  information you provide about yourself or others to complete the  transaction for which the information is intended. Such transactions  may include: administering a service, such as email, search,  advertising sales, ecommerce; completing an order; replying to support  requests; or contacting you if you have granted us permission to do so. <br>
          <br>
          From time to time, we also use the information you provide  about yourself or others to inform you of additions or improvements to  the i-Amour services as well as conduct member surveys in order to  improve our services. <br>

          <br>
          We may also use personally identifiable user information to  provide targeted content and commerce opportunities to users based on  their demographic and behavioral information. <br>
          <br>
          Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable  information provided to us online in ways or for reasons unrelated to  the ones described above without also providing an opportunity to  opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Opt-Out and Termination:</strong> <br>
          <br>

          We believe that our ability to share your Personal Information  with our affiliates, vendors and certain third parties improves our  ability to provide services to you. However, if you object to our  sharing of your personal information and would like to exercise your  rights under the Financial Services Modernization Act and the Fair  Reporting Act to limit our use of certain information governed by the  mandatory opt-out provisions of those acts (should we ever collect such  information), and if you would like to terminate our use of your  Personal Information on a going forward basis (except as it relates to  prior financial transaction and communications) you can do that by  contacting us. However, this will result in the termination of your  i-Amour user account(s). Please click here to contact us. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Cookie</strong> <br>
          <br>
          We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files  of your computer. The cookie enables us to collect information about  your visits to i-Amour. We may use this information to enhance your  i-Amour experience and may share some information with our members,  vendors, sponsors or others. <br>
          <br>
          You can turn off the cookie function in your web browser, then you won't be able to register as a member or log in. <br>

          <br>
          <strong>Parental rights</strong> <br>
          <br>
           As a parent you have the right to review your minor child's  personal information, have it deleted and refuse i-Amour to further  collect information from your child. This would of course require a  proper identification. Please contact us at parentsright@i-Amour.com <br>
          (Minor in the US = under 13)
           (Minor in non-US= under 16)<br>
