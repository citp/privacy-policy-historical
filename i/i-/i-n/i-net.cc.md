# iNET

This Privacy Notice describes what information is collected by us from any user of the iNET Application and Service (collectively or individually "User(s)"), as well as our use and disclosure of that information.

#### User Privacy

iNET does not collect any personally identifiable information on iNET. iNET automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information from Users that is used in the aggregate only. iNET does not collect, store, or share any permanent identifiers of Users, including IP addresses. Please note that iNET only enables privacy and encrypts user Internet sessions when it is turned ON.

#### Web Security

iNET encrypts every page visited by our Users, thus protecting communications between each User and the Internet. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant that the safeguards will be uninterrupted or effective, or that any information you transmit to iNET will remain secure, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If iNET learns of a security systems breach, we may post a notice on the iNET website to notify Users. Please note that iNET helps secure your Internet session, not your computer. iNET does not protect your computer from viruses or malware. We recommend getting anti-virus/anti-malware solutions from one of our reputable partners in order to also help secure your computer. 

#### When iNET Discloses Information Collected

iNET may share anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers, and other current and prospective business partners. iNET may use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes, and may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. iNET may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages Users receive while using the iNET, and those outside companies may have access to anonymous data that we collect from iNET users.

iNET may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the iNET.
