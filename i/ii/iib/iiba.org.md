###  **How do we share and disclose information to third parties?**

We do not rent,trade or sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share and disclose information (including Personal Information) about our users in the following limited circumstances:

  * Vendors, consultants and other service providers:  



o We may share your information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who we employ to perform tasks on our behalf. These companies include (for example) our payment processing providers, website analytics companies (e.g., Google Analytics), product feedback and surveys (e.g. Survey Monkey, Formstack), CRM service providers (e.g. MS Dynamics, Salesforce), or email service providers (e.g. Informz) and others.  
o If IIBA has received your Personal Information and subsequently transfers that information to a third-party agent or service provider for processing, IIBA shall remain responsible for ensuring that such third-party agent or service provider processes your Personal Information to the standard required by our Privacy commitments. Unless we tell you differently and you consent, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

  * Other IIBA Entities: 



o We may also share your personal information with our affiliated chapters and other IIBA entities for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy and your IIBA sites profile preferences.

  * Protection of IIBA and Others: 



o We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our agreements with you and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IIBA, our employees, our users, or others.

  * Disclosures for National Security or Law Enforcement: 



o Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Information in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  
 

###  Is Personal Information about me secure?

We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures to protect any information we hold in our records from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  Unfortunately, no company or service can guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Among other practices, your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

###  **How long do we keep Personal Information?  **

We keep your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above. We will retain your account profile data as necessary for our legitimate business purposes or to comply with our legal obligations (such as record keeping, accounting, fraud prevention and other business administrative purposes). However, we will maintain your personal information longer where required for tax or accounting purposes, to ensure we would be able to defend or raise a claim, or where we have a specific need to retain, though we will generally not keep personal information for longer than seven years following the last date of communication with you. Legitimate business purposes that we may rely on to keep your personal information when you are not a customer include direct marketing (where you have not opted-out) for up to two years, facilitating the restoration or establishment of a user account in the future, maintaining business intelligence systems for analytics and other internal purposes, etc. Where your information is no longer required, we will ensure it is disposed of in a secure manner.

####  Rights for users

Individuals have the following rights with respect to their personal information:

  * **Access**. You can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal information; give you a copy of that data; and provide you with other information about your personal information such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad, how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we have carried out any profiling, to the extent that such information has not already been provided to you in this Policy.
  * **Rectification**. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate information. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.
  * **Erasure**. You can ask us to erase your personal information, but only where it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); following a successful right to object (see 'Objection' below); it has been processed unlawfully; or to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject. We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances in which we would deny that request.
  * **Restriction**. You can ask us to restrict (i.e., keep but not use) your personal information, but only where its accuracy is contested (see 'Rectification' above), to allow us to verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending. We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction where we have your consent; to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
  * **Objection**. You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our 'legitimate interests' as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms. In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing without providing any reason. We will then cease the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
  * **Portability**. You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it 'ported' directly to another Data Controller, but only where our processing is based on your consent and the processing is carried out by automated means.
  * **Withdrawal of Consent**. You can withdraw your consent in respect of any processing of personal information which is based upon a consent which you have previously provided



###  International Data Transfers

Personal Information you submit on the IIBA sites or through the IIBA Services is sent to and stored on the IIBA servers or our hosted service providers’ cloud servers on our behalf, which are mainly located in Canada and/or the United States. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those in your country of residence. However, we will always protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.

Please note that we are required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
