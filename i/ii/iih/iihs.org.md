Thank you for visiting the website of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute. This privacy policy explains our online information practices.

We use Google Analytics for tracking web statistics. Google Analytics runs a bit of code in your browser that sends the following information:

  * type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  * date and time you access our site;
  * pages you visit; and
  * If you linked to our website from another website, the address of that site.



In addition, Google Analytics collects more detailed information such as your screen resolution. Google's use of these data is covered by its own privacy policy. _None of the information collected by Google identifies you personally._

We use the information we collect to count the number visitors to the different pages on our site and to help us make our site more useful. This type of information is retained indefinitely.
