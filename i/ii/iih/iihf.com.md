The information requested will allow the IIHF to create and maintain Your user account and identify  
you as one of our users.

**Automatic Information:** When You visit the IIHF website or certain IIHF digital properties, the IIHF  
will use “cookies” to collect information. Cookies are small data files, which are transferred to a  
computer’s hard disk to memorize information like registration IDs and passwords. A cookie will  
typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has originated, the “lifetime” of the  
cookie and various values.

The IIHF uses “first party cookies – ID cookies” to enable certain features on the IIHF website or  
certain IIHF digital properties, to better understand how You interact with the IIHF website and  
digital properties and to monitor aggregate usage by IIHF website and IIHF digital properties’  
users and web traffic routing. The IIHF uses either session cookies (duration of Your visit) or  
persistent cookies (stays on Your computer until You clear your browser).

The IIHF also uses “third party cookies” to enable certain services to us such as analytics and  
advertising. For example the IIHF uses google analytics to be able to measure traffic and  
performance of Digital Services.

You can always block cookies by updating Your web browser privacy settings. To do so, You will  
have to access the “Help” menu in Your browser’s menu bar and search for the term “cookies”. If  
You decline acceptance of cookies or block cookies, please note that You may experience less  
customized experience on this Website. 

### Why do You have to Register?

The IIHF content is generally available on the Digital Services without the need to register as a  
user. However, certain personalization options, transactions or services (such as e-commerce,  
newsletters, professional services or event registration services) offered on IIHF Digital Services  
require that you register with the IIHF and provide certain information about You. 

### How is Your Information Used?

The IIHF uses and processes Your personal information collected to: 

  * Customize the content You see on IIHF Digital Services
  * For research, development and analytical purposes
  * To fulfill Your requests for certain products and/or services
  * ​To communicate with You
  * For activities, promotions and/or campaigns of the IIHF or IIHF partners
  * To send You communication when You have opted-in to receive certain types of information from the IIHF.



The IIHF reviews its retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. The IIHF is  
legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations. The IIHF will  
hold Your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity,  
or as long as is set out in any relevant contract You hold with us. 

### Who has access to Your personal information?

The IIHF will not sell or rent Your personal information to third parties. The IIHF will not share Your  
information with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Third Party Service Providers working on IIHF’s behalf:** the IIHF may pass Your personal  
information to our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated  
organizations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to You on our behalf (for  
example to analyze IIHF Digital Platform fan usage, infrastructure and general IT services, email  
communications and push notifications, accreditation, arranging travel or accommodation, etc.).  
However, when the IIHF uses third party service providers, the IIHF discloses only the personal  
information that is necessary to deliver the service. Further, we have a contract in place that  
ensure confidentiality and requires them to keep Your information secure and not to use it for their  
own direct marketing purposes. Please be assured that we will not release Your personal  
information to third parties beyond the IIHF network for them to use for their own direct marketing  
purposes, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example,  
by a court or for the purpose of prevention of fraud or other crimes.

**Third Party Product Providers the IIHF works in association with:** the IIHF works closely with  
various other third-party product providers (for example the IIHF Official World Championship  
Merchandizing Partner and IIHF Championships Authorized Ticket Brokers) and various IIHF  
Partners (NIKE, GRAF, etc.) which have links to their website via IIHF website or digital properties.  
When utilizing Your information, the third-party service provider and IIHF Partner will be acting as  
the data controller of Your information. The IIHF partners and third-party product provider, and not  
the IIHF, are responsible for the treatment of your personal information when the IIHF partners or  
third-party product provider utilize Your personal information. If You choose to directly register with  
an IIHF partner or third-party product provider’s websites at the same time You register with the  
IIHF Digital Services, the terms of the Privacy Policy of the IIHF partner or third-party service shall  
be incorporate herein by reference. 

### How do we Protect Your Personal Information?

**Data Security:** The IIHF has adopted reasonable security measures, appropriate to the sensitivity  
of the personal information, against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss or destruction of  
personal information. These measures may include technological, physical and organization  
methods of security. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that  
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal  
information for improper purposes.

If You communicate with the IIHF by email, You should note that the secrecy of Internet email is  
uncertain. By sending sensitive or confidential email messages or information which is not  
encrypted You accept the risk of such uncertainty and possible lack of confidentiality over the  
Internet.

**International Transfer:** Your information is primarily processed in Switzerland and the European  
Union but may be stored and used elsewhere depending on the location of affiliates, partners, and  
other entities who are permitted to access such information under the terms of this Privacy Policy  
(for example a company helping us provide a Digital Service). Such other locations, like the United  
States of America, do not provide in their laws the level of protection of your privacy equivalent to  
the one applied in the European Union or Switzerland. By accessing, using or registering for the  
IIHF Digital Services or submitting personal information to the IIHF, you specifically agree to the  
transfer any related purpose.

**Children’s Privacy:** The IIHF does not knowingly collect personal information from Children. The  
IIHF does not take specific steps to protect the privacy of children who disclose their personal  
information to the IIHF. If the IIHF becomes aware that a child has provided us with person  
information without parental consent, we will take steps to delete this information and close the  
child’s account.
