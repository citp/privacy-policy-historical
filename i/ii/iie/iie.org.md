# Privacy Policy

_Disclaimer_

The information provided on this website is not official U.S. Government information and does not represent the views or positions of the U.S. Agency for International Development or the U.S. Government.

**Last Updated: May 2018**

### Introduction

At the Institute of International Education (“IIE”), we understand that privacy is an important issue for visitors to our Website, and your privacy is equally important to us. This Privacy Policy ("Policy"), which is part of our **[Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Learn/Terms-and-Conditions)** , covers the treatment of the personal information we collect when you visit this website or any other website we operate (the "Website").

If you visit or interact with the Website, you are signifying to us that you consent to this Policy and the ways we collect, use, process and transfer your personal data as described here. **We may change this Policy, and will post any changes here. If you continue to access or use the Website after we post the changed Policy, we consider you to have accepted the changed Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not access or use the Website**. We will post a **“LAST UPDATED”** legend at the top of the Policy.

Under the European Data Protection Legislation (if it applies to you) and other applicable law, IIE is the **data controller** responsible for the processing of your Personal Information collected from and through the Website. IIE is the sole owner of any information collected on the Website. For certain Programs we administer for sponsors, IIE is a **data processor** of Personal Information that is collected from applicants, participants, partners and others in connection with these Programs. This Policy applies to the Personal Information collected from and through the Website. IIE Programs and sponsored Programs we administer may have additional or different data privacy policies and practices. These are disclosed at the points where data is collected for those Programs.

### Country-Specific Provisions

The Schedules appearing at the end of this Policy describe modifications of certain parts of this Policy that might apply to you if you reside in a country identified in a Schedule or if you submit information to an IIE office located in a country identified in a Schedule. Please review the Schedules to determine if any of the modifications apply to you.

### European Data Protection Legislation

In this Policy, **"European Data Protection Legislation"** means all applicable legislation relating to data protection in the European Economic Area ( **"EEA")** , including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ( **"GDPR"** ) and all laws adapted under or replacing the GDPR. Where this Policy uses terms specially defined in the GDPR, the GDPR definitions apply.

If the GDPR applies to you, your specific rights are listed at the end of this Policy.

### Information You Provide to Us

**Personal Information Examples** means data relating to you from which you can be reasonably identified. Examples include your full name, date of birth, gender, email address, postal address, telephone number, job title, educational institution, financial information and your employer.

When you communicate your Personal Information to us through the Website, we will tell you at each collection point what information is required and what we use it for. You can choose not to enter some or all your Personal Information, but if you do so, we might not be able to respond to your query, communicate further with you and/or provide the requested services.

### How We Use Your Data

As allowed by law and unless this Policy states otherwise elsewhere, we will use your Personal Information as described below.

**Information We Collect Directly**

You may visit the Website without being required to provide your name, email address or other personal information. Some features of the Website might include features or services that permit you to enter contact information and other information about you, such as your name, address and e-mail address. Depending on why and how you communicate with us via the Website, we will use your Personal Information as follows:

  * **If you are inquiring about programs or services we provide or administer:** to respond to your query and/or give you information you request.
  * **If you are inquiring about how your organization could support or work with IIE: **to consider whether it would be beneficial to work with your organization. We will let you know when we need your Personal Information in order to perform an agreement with you or your organization or to comply with a legal obligation.
  * **If you are member of the public and you inquire about employment with us:** to consider and decide how to respond to your query.

  * **If you are submitting a comment on a Bulletin Board or Chat Area:** to publish your comment on the grounds that by clicking “submit,” you consented to our posting your Personal Information on the Bulletin Board or Chat Area selected by you. You may withdraw your consent to our using your Personal Information this way by amending or deleting your comment or by contacting us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org). If you withdraw your consent, it will not change how we used your Personal Information before you withdrew that consent, but the comment will not be displayed in the future.
  * **If you opt-in to receive marketing communications:** to share information about our programs, services, news and events. When you enter your contact details for this reason and click “sign up,” you will be consenting to us contacting you for these purposes. We will only send you marketing communications if you have consented.



When you opt-in to receive marketing communications from us, you are giving your consent for your Personal Information to be used by us to contact you by email, direct mail and/or telephone as shown on the consent form, and to deliver personalized website experiences, to share information about relevant products, services, best practice information, industry news and events. You may to withdraw your consent or amend your communication preferences by contacting us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org) or clicking the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any email you receive from us.

If you later decide you do not want to receive correspondence from us, such as communications regarding available Programs, press releases, newsletters, marketing, promotions, or other topics, simply click the “unsubscribe” link provided in that email message. Withdrawing your consent will not affect our use of the Personal Information prior to you withdrawing your consent, but it will mean that we will not contact you about available Programs, press releases, newsletters, marketing, promotions or other topics in the future.

**Information We Collect Automatically**

When you interact with the Website, we automatically collect information about your use of the Website from your browser in the Website server logs. Whenever you request a page through your browser, the navigation and clickstream data, such as your IP address, browser (and version), operating system, date, time, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. We use software to create summaries from these statistics so we can evaluate content worth, Website and system administration, and anonymous user analysis. We use “cookie” technology on our Website. Cookies let us identify a user’s computer (so, for example, you won’t have to log in every time you visit the Website), and can help make it easier to navigate through the Website (cookies can record a user’s preferences and other data about the user’s Website visit).

When you use the Website for the first time, cookies that are essential to make the Website operate (“essential cookies”) will have been set, but other cookies will not have been set unless you agreed to those cookies being set at that time. If you have agreed to accept cookies, then the Website will remember this and continue to set cookies each time you visit.

Some cookies are deleted when you close your browser. These are known as “session cookies.” Others remain on your device until they expire or you delete them. These are known as “persistent cookies.” They enable us to remember things about you as a returning visitor. If you do not want cookies to be stored, you may turn off cookies individually, or you can select the appropriate options on your web browser to delete some or all cookies. However, if you block some or all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to use or access all or parts of the Website, such as being able to log on to member specific areas.

**Essential Cookies**  
Essential cookies enable you to navigate the Website and to use its services and features. Without these necessary cookies, the Website will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Website or certain services or features.

We have provided examples of how to disable cookies on the most popular browsers below:

Please note that Google and other third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies as a result of your visiting other websites.

Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our information collection practices on our Site will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers. However, you may refuse to accept cookies in order to prevent tracking activities.

### Sharing Personal Information

We may share your Personal Information with:

  * our IIE offices and affiliates,
  * our service providers and other third parties that make the Website available, enhance its functionality or otherwise provide services to IIE or its service providers,
  * any other person or entity about which we tell you when you provide your Personal Information,
  * and any other person or entity necessary for protecting the rights or safety of IIE or others.



We will not sell, market, share, rent or otherwise distribute your Personal Information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this Policy, we will release Personal Information to another person or company only with your consent or if required or permitted by law. If your Personal Information will be disclosed to any other recipients than are stated in this Policy, we will inform you at the time we collect your Personal Information and obtain your consent.

We do reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers or transferees of any of our assets.

### Bulletin Boards and Chat Areas

Personal Information that you voluntarily disclose and transmit online may be viewed and used by others. Users of the Website are solely responsible for the content of messages and other content they post online, including on public forums. These forums include, but are not limited to, on and offsite chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or other publicly accessible forums that may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information within a public forum, your information may be collected and used by others. We cannot control such uses of your Personal Information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

### International Transfers

We store and process your Personal Information in various countries worldwide including the United States. We may transfer and access such information from around the world, including the United States and other countries in which we operate or in which our hosted service providers’ cloud servers are located so that we can use the information as described in this Policy.

IIE operates this Website from the United States, which has not been deemed to offer adequate data protection by the European Commission. If you provide your Personal Information to us, be aware you are doing so on the basis that you explicitly consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside the EEA. The potential consequence of you explicitly consenting to this is that there is a risk that your Personal Information will not be protected in a manner that complies with European Data Protection Legislation. You can withdraw your consent to such international transfers by contacting us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org), but if you do, we will not be able to contact you about our Programs and services we may be able to offer you going forward. Where we pass your Personal Information from an IIE entity or office inside the EEA to IIE parties located outside the EEA that do not offer adequate protection as determined by the European Commission, we do this under a data sharing agreement that includes the appropriate EU model international data transfer clauses to make sure your personal information is protected. Where IIE makes transfers of personal information outside IIE to another organization and if they are not subscribed to an approved data protection framework, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield, that permits the transfer of Personal Information to them from the EEA, we rely on the use of the EU model international data transfer clauses if the country the receiving organization is located in is not listed as ‘adequate’ by the European Commission. A copy of the terms of these agreements, signed by the recipient, can be obtained by contacting us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org).

### Security of Personal Information

While we undertake every reasonable effort to prevent unauthorized Internet access to Personal Information we collect, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to us, information provided online, or information stored by us or our service providers. You submit your Personal Information at your own risk. We are not liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or the acts of our service providers or other third parties. This means you accept all risks associated with any data transmission and Internet usage, including the risk that your Personal Information may be intercepted in transit.

### External Links

The Website contains links to third party websites. Unless we state otherwise in writing, IIE makes no representations whatsoever concerning the content or privacy practices or data protection standards of those websites. Our link to a site is not an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation regarding the website, its owners, or its providers. There are risks associated with using any information, software, or products found on the Internet, and IIE cautions you to make sure that you understand these risks before retrieving, using, relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. If you leave the Website and visit other sites, you should carefully read the privacy statements of other websites that collect Personal Information. These other websites may collect or solicit personal data or send their own cookies to your computer. IIE is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.

This Policy applies only to this Website and not to any webpages not a part of this Website, even if there are hyperlinks from this Website to another website. As an example, you may decide to connect with us through social media providers that are provided by third parties. The collection, processing, or use of information by such a third party is subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policy, and IIE is not responsible for their actions.

Our Site is not specifically targeted to children, we do not actively solicit information from children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children without proper parental consent.

We may also retain some or all your Personal Information for recordkeeping or legal purposes, to enforce our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Learn/Terms-and-Conditions), or as a result of such information being stored on our systems through routine backup or archiving processes.
