_Privacy Policy_

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") covers the treatment of all personal information that the Institute of International Education, Inc. ("IIE") collects when you visit its websites (the "Website"). At IIE, we understand that privacy is important to visitors to the Website. By visiting or otherwise interacting with the Website, you signify your unequivocal consent to this Policy and to the collection, use, processing and transfer of your personal data as described in this Policy. **We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Policy at any time, and we will post the modified policy here. Any modification will be effective immediately upon posting on this Website. Your continued access to or use of the Website following the posting of any modified Policy indicates your unequivocal acceptance of such modified Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, you are not authorized to access or otherwise use the Website.** You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Policy so that you will be apprised of any changes. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this Policy. This Policy is further subject to IIE’s [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/Terms-and-Conditions) posted on the Website.

**Information Collection and Use; Security of Your Information**

_Information from Your Interaction with Our Website; Use of Cookies_

Like many website owners, IIE receives and records non-personally identifiable information from your browser in the Website server logs. Whenever you request a page through your browser, the navigation and clickstream data, such as IP address, browser (and version), operating system, date, time, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. IIE uses software programs to create summaries from these statistics for such purposes as evaluating content worth, Website and system administration, and anonymous user analysis. We use “cookie” technology on our Website. Cookies allow us to identify a user’s computer (so, for example, you won’t have to log in every time you visit the Website), and can help make it easier for a user to navigate through the Website (cookies can record a user’s preferences and other data about the user’s Website visit). Your web browser may allow you to disable cookies, but please realize that doing so may make certain features or pages of the Website unavailable to you. Except for purposes of enforcing our Terms and Conditions or complying with legal obligations, we do not use this information to identify specific individuals.

_Personal Information Examples_

Aside from this standard tracking data, the only personal information we collect about you is such personally identifiable data ("Personal Information") as you knowingly provide to us on the Website. Personal Information can include your name, birth date, gender, email address, physical address and telephone number, financial information and/or other personal information you may provide. Except as provided otherwise by law or pursuant to this Policy, IIE is the sole owner of any information collected on the Website.

_Use and Sharing of Personal Information_

To the extent permitted by law and except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, Personal Information collected may be used for system and Website maintenance and enhancement, administration and audit purposes, reviewing, considering and processing of applications you submit concerning a program or scholarship affiliated with IIE in any way, communicating with you about IIE-related programs and services (including alumni events or programs) or the programs and services of our business partners in the education sector, protecting the rights or safety of IIE or others, complying with legal obligations, responding to queries from you, providing you with information you request, and any other purposes about which we notify you when you provide the relevant Personal Information to us. We may share your Personal Information with our IIE offices, technical consultants, third party auditors, third parties who are involved in the review, processing or consideration of any application you submit concerning a program or scholarship affiliated with IIE in any way, other third parties who make the Website available, enhance its functionality or otherwise provide services to IIE or its service providers, any other person or entity about which we inform you when you provide your Personal Information, and any other person or entity necessary for protecting the rights or safety of IIE or others. We will not sell, market, share, rent or otherwise distribute your Personal Information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy. Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, we will only release Personal Information to another person or company with your consent or to the extent required or permitted by law.

Please note that we do reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers or transferees of any of our assets.

If you do not want to provide us with your Personal Information, you are not required to do so; however, while you may still access the Website, certain services may not be available to you. By providing your Personal Information to us via the Website, you consent to receive information and updates from us, our representatives or our authorized third party service providers (except where prohibited by law). You may contact us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org) at any time regarding your Personal Information and to request corrections to such information.

_Security of Personal Information_

While we undertake reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to user data we collect from you, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online or stored by us or our service providers, and you submit such Personal Information at your own risk. You agree that we are not liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or the acts of our service providers or other third parties. You accept all risks associated with any data transmission and Internet usage, including the risk that your Personal Information may be intercepted in transit.

**Bulletin Boards and Chat Areas**

You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online may be viewed and used by others. Users of the Website are solely responsible for the content of messages and other content they post online, including on public forums. These forums include, but are not limited to, on and offsite chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or other publicly accessible forums which may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information within a public forum, your information may be collected and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your Personal Information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

**External Links**

The Website may contain links to third party websites. Unless we expressly state otherwise in writing, IIE makes no representations whatsoever concerning the content of those websites. The fact that IIE has provided a link to a site is not an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation with respect to such site, its owners, or its providers. There are risks associated with using any information, software, or products found on the Internet, and IIE cautions you to make sure that you understand these risks before retrieving, using, relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. In addition, if you leave the Website and visit other sites, you should carefully read the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information. These other websites may collect or solicit personal data or send their own cookies to your computer. Please be aware that IIE is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. This Policy applies only to this Website and not to any webpages not a part of this Website, regardless of any hyperlinks from this Website to another website. As an example, if you purchase any product or service available through the Website, you may be transferred to a website operated by a third party processor and be required to provide financial and other Personal Information to that third party processor. As another example, you may decide to connect with us through various social media tools, such as Facebook or Twitter, that are provided by third parties. Any collection, processing, or use of information by such a third party is subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policy, and we will not be responsible for their actions. Please check the privacy statements of these other websites for more information about their policies on collection and use of personal information.

**Note to Parents and Children**

IIE is concerned about the protection of online privacy for all Website users. We encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide Personal Information on the Website or any other site without their parents’ permission. Further, except in rare circumstances (such as an inquiry or application from a university student who is under the age of 18), the Website is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we have no intention of collecting Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If you know or suspect that your child who is under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, you should contact us immediately if you would like the information submitted by your child deleted from our records.

**Special California Notice**

If you are a resident of California (U.S.A.) under the age of 18 and are a registered user of our Website, you may request that we remove of any content you post to our Website that can be accessed by any other user (whether registered or not). To request removal of content under this provision, please send an email to [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org) and provide us with a description of the content and the location of the content on our Site, and any other information we may require in order to consider your request. Please note that removal of content under this provision does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on the Website by you.

**Retention, Storage and Deletion of Information**

You have the option, at any time, to request deletion of your Personal Information held by us; however, we may retain some or all of your Personal Information for recordkeeping or legal purposes, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, or as a result of such information being stored on our systems through routine backup or archiving processes. All deletion requests should be sent to us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org), and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. However, we are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from the lists or systems of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Policy.

**Governing Law**

The laws of the State of New York shall govern this Policy regardless of your location. You hereby expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York, for all matters or disputes arising out of or relating to this Policy or your access or use of the Website.

**Communications and Opting Out**

By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails from us. We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send surveys or information about other products or services developed or provided by us or our vendors or business partners; however, we will not give your email address to another party to promote their products or services directly to you. If you do not wish to receive these types of emails from us, you may “opt-out” by sending an email to us at [siteinfo@iie.org](mailto:siteinfo@iie.org); however, please understand that we may continue sending you emails related to any account you have with us, any application you have submitted, or any transaction or agreement you have entered into with us. Please note that there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to “opt-out” and when it is processed and reflected in our systems; accordingly, you may continue to receive certain communications from us for a limited time after you unsubscribe. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience. Except for Personal Information submitted as part of an application or a purchase, any communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions or the like, is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and nonproprietary.
