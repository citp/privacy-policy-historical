Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our
online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is
collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at
every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the iSellPagerank.com website. On
some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types
of personal information collected at these pages are:
         Name
         Address
         Email address
         Phone number
         Website Information
         Credit/Debit Card Information
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that
order. We will never sell, rent, or lease your details, or your client details (name, address, email
etc...) to any other third party.
We provide various opt-out newsletters and promotional emails to our members. Members can
unsubscribe from these newsletters at their own will.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for
any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or
otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.


Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of
information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
We have put security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of all information
under our control. All orders are processed via a secure server (SSL) and credit card details will
never be emailed.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect
or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of
our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request
that credibly shows error.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity
before granting access or making corrections.
How To Contact Us
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 1-800-
