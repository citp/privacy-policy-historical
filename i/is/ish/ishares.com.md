We are committed to:

  * protecting the personal information you provide to us;
  * telling you how we use the information we gather about you; and
  * ensuring that you know why we intend to disclose your personal information.



## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is dated 24 May 2012. BlackRock reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time without notice, by updating this posting, in which case the date of the Policy will be revised. However, you will be asked to provide your consent to updated versions of this Policy in the event of a material change to the information contained within it. In addition, you will be asked to reaffirm your consent to this Policy on a six monthly basis.

## Information Collection and Use

**Personally Identifiable Information**

The personally identifiable information you submit to our Websites is used to service your account, to improve our services to you and/or to provide you with information on BlackRock products and services. The types of personal information that may be collected at our Websites include: name, address, email address and telephone number. We will not sell, share or rent your personally identifiable information to others in contravention of this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, if the Website is a password protected site, then (a) once you submit your password and enter, the Website will recognize who you are and will collect all information that you submit, including all electronic instructions (including all transaction information), and (b) any information collected about you from the Website may be associated with other identifying information that we have about you.

**Aggregate Information**

We generally record certain usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our Websites. This information may include the websites that you access immediately before and after your visit to our Websites, the Internet browser you are using and your IP address. If we use such data at all it will be on an aggregate basis, and we will not disclose to third parties any information that could be used to identify you personally.

**Service Providers**

We may use internal service providers to operate our Websites and employ other persons to perform work on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and e-mail. These persons may have access to the personally identifiable information you submit through the Websites, but only for the purpose of performing their duties. These personnel may not use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

**Compliance with Laws**

We do not automatically collect personally identifiable information from visitors to our Websites, except to the extent we are required to do so pursuant to some statute or regulation applicable to us. We will not provide any personally identifiable information to any other persons, except if we are required to make disclosures by any law, any government or private parties in connection with a lawsuit, subpoena, investigation or similar proceeding.

**E-mail and Marketing**

BlackRock does not sell its customers' e-mail addresses, nor will we provide your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. BlackRock will not send you e-mail messages without first receiving your permission, unless it relates to servicing your account or unless you have consented to receiving electronic delivery of fund documents as part of our E-Delivery service. It is our policy to include instructions for unsubscribing from these permission-based programs. We recommend that you do not send us any individual personal information via non secure methods of correspondence, including via public electronic communication channels, such as Internet e-mail, which are generally not secure.

**Business Transfers**

If the business, stock or assets of BlackRock are acquired or merged with another business entity, we will share all or some of your information with this entity to continue to provide our service to you. You will receive notice of such an event and the new entity will inform you of any changes to the practices in this Privacy Policy. If the new entity wishes to make additional use of your information, you may decline such use at such time.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

The personal information you provide to us will only be disclosed to third parties if we have your permission, or as set out in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose details about the general use of our Websites to third parties – for example, to demonstrate patterns of use to advertisers and other business partners. Information we pass on for this purpose will not include any personal information by which you may be identified. We endeavor to prevent unauthorized disclosures of your personal information by third parties but we are not responsible for any unauthorized disclosures or other breaches of security or for the actions of others if the information was passed to them with your authority or with the authority of anyone other than us or our group companies.

## Cookies

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are stored in your computer’s memory and hard drive when you visit certain web pages. They are used to enable websites to function or to provide information to the owners of a website.

**Why Do We Use Cookies?**

Cookies help us to provide customized services and information. We use cookies on all our Websites to tell us, in general terms, how and when pages in our Websites are visited, what our users’ technology preferences are – such as what type of video player they use – and whether our Websites are functioning properly.

If you are using one of our password-protected sites, then the website may use cookies or other technology to help us authenticate you, store and recognize your configuration and user attributes, facilitate your navigation of the website and customize its content so that the information made available is likely to be of more interest to you.

In broad terms, we use cookies on our Websites for the following purposes:

  * Analytical purposes: Analytical cookies allow us to recognize measure and track visitors to our Websites. This helps us to improve and develop the way our Websites work, for example, by determining whether site visitors can find information easily, or by identifying the aspects of websites that are of the most interest to them.
  * Usage preferences: Some of the cookies on our Websites are activated when visitors to our sites make a choice about their usage of the site. Our Websites then ‘remember’ the settings preferences of the user concerned. This allows us to tailor aspects of our sites to the individual user.
  * Terms and conditions: We use cookies on our Websites to record when a site visitor has seen a policy, such as this one, or provided consent, such as consent to the terms and conditions on our Websites. This helps to improve the user’s experience of the site – for example, it avoids a user from repeatedly being asked to consent to the same terms.
  * Session management: The software that runs our websites uses cookies for technical purposes needed by the internal workings of our servers. For instance, we use cookies to distribute requests among multiple servers, authenticate users and determine what features of the site they can access, verify the origin of requests, keep track of information about a user’s session and determine which options or pages to display in order for the site to function.
  * Functional purposes: Functional purpose cookies store information that is needed by our applications to process and operate. For example, where transactions or requests within an application involve multiple workflow stages, cookies are used to store the information from each stage temporarily, in order to facilitate completion of the overall transaction or request.



**Your Cookie Preferences**

To make full use of Blackrock’s Websites, your computer or mobile device will need to accept cookies, as our sites will not function properly without them. In addition, cookies are required in order to provide you with personalized features on our Websites.

**Local Flash Storage**

On certain of our Websites, we include content designed for display using Adobe Flash Player, such as animations, videos and tools. Local flash storage (often referred to as “Flash cookies”) can be used to help improve your experience as a user. Flash storage is retained on your device in much the same way as standard cookies, but is managed directly by your Flash software.

If you wish to disable or delete information stored locally in Flash, please see the documentation for your Flash software, located at www.adobe.com. Please note that, if you disable Flash cookies, some site functionality may not work.

**Third Party Cookies**

When you visit our Websites, you may receive cookies that are set by third parties. These may include cookies set by Google, Unica, Forsee, Wall Street on Demand, Morningstar, Media Mind and/or Flurry. These cookies are used for the purposes described in the “Why Do We Use Cookies?” section of this policy. We do not control the setting of these third party cookies, so we suggest you might wish to check the third party websites for more information about their use of cookies and how to manage them.

**Amending Cookie Preferences**

If you wish to remove cookies set by our Websites from your browser in the future, you may delete them. The instructions for removing cookies from your computer or mobile device depend on the operating system and web browser you use. Please note, however, that withdrawing your agreement to the use of cookies on our sites will impair the functionality of the sites.

The site www.allaboutcookies.org includes instructions for managing cookies on many commonly used browses, or you may consult the vendor documentation for your specific software.
