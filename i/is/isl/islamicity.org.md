  5. ## Main Hubs & Home Pages

Everything under IslamiCity is categorized under the major hubs you see in this panel. Due to overwhelming content, each of these hubs can be considered a home page of its own. 

_Faith_ is where the tenets, pillars and spiruality related content is found. 

_Science_ section features not just Science but also Nature and Technology. This section is more for the technologically minded. 

_World_ section is for the News Buds. It covers day to day World Affairs, Politics & News. 

_Life_ section is all about Society, Art, Culture, History, Sports, Food, Music and much more. 

_Values_ section on the other hand is very special. We created it for only one thing in mind; to create a peaceful corner that features just inspiring and uplifting material, focused around _Universal Values_ to be reflect upon -- _at a time never needed more desperately than now_

  6. ## Inspiring Themes

Every other Friday, we try to feature a new theme which will uplift our spirituality. Our themes mostly focus on the universal values such as _compassion_ , _patience_ , _love_ and so on. 

We feature each theme with a beautiful image. _Click on these beautiful images & start exploring the theme/value behind it. _
