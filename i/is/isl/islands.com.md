**How Islands.com Uses the Information It Collects**  
There will be times when we will ask you for personal information. In order to ensure the integrity of your personal information, all of your data is stored in our secure databases. Occasionally, we make portions of our subscriber list available to carefully screened companies that offer products and services we think may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive these offers, please advise us at 800-322-1161.

At various points throughout the Islands.com site, you may choose to sign up for a subscription only to Islands.com newsletters. In order to sign up to receive newsletters from Islands.com, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address. You may, at any time, decline to receive these e-mail newsletters by sending an e-mail with 'REMOVE' in the subject line to jkravets@islands.com.

**Contests**  
When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address so that we can administer the contest and notify winners. Additionally, you may be able to choose whether you would like to receive further communications from Islands.com. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

We value opinions and comments from Islands.com members, and you may have the opportunity to give us your feedback through online surveys. In conducting these surveys, we may ask for your name, address, or e-mail address so that we can appropriately identify you. Survey information collected will be aggregated and used to make improvements to the site and to improve Islands.com service and general offerings. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

**Links** This Web site contains links to other partner sites. Please be aware that Islands.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Cookies**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to recognize you. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The only personal information a cookie contains is the information you provide yourself. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set your browser to block them in the future. When you enter personal information on Islands.com, your personally identifiable information may be linked to a cookie on your computer.

**IP Addresses**  
Islands.com collects the IP addresses used to access our service and the dates and times of access. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Information with Islands.com Partners**  
If you elect to share your information with Islands.com partners when registering with Islands.com by checking the appropriate opt-in box, we may choose to provide your information only to select Islands.com partners. If you have not elected to share this information with Islands.com partners, we will not provide your information to Islands.com partners or any other third parties.

Whether or not you have elected to share your information with Islands.com partners, Islands.com may share your data in some cases with strategic affiliate partners. Islands.com strategic affiliate partners are forbidden from disclosing personal information with any party who might market products or services or contact you for any purpose other than the provision of the specific services requested by you when visiting Islands.com or our strategic affiliate partners' sites.

**Safeguards to Protect the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of your Information**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' personal information. When users submit sensitive information via the site, your information is protected both on- and off-line. All information you provide to Islands.com on-line is stored on a secure database on Islands.com's servers. We also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. Access to all of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment behind a locked door.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, please send an e-mail to islands@Islands.com.
