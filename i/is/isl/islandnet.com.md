## Customer Internet Use:

Islandnet does not monitor or censor customer "surfing" or e-mail traffic. However, Islandnet tracks customer use statistics as they relate to equipment usage, bandwidth, and overall trends. Such information is used to configure and maintain current equipment and software, determine future equipment and software needs, and for billing customers.

Islandnet monitors customer usage statistics to determine whether customer resource use complies with the limits of service packages. Where customer use of particular resources exceed the guidelines relating to a customer's service package, Islandnet may contact the customer to request a reduction of the customer's use of such resources or to allow the customer to move to an appropriate service level.

Where required by court order and / or by authorities having legal jurisdiction over matters concerning Internet communication, Islandnet may monitor customer Internet activity.

## Customer Internet Files:

Customer files stored on Islandnet's computer systems--including website and e-mail files--are the property of the customer. However, if a customer fails to make payment for service and continues to do so after being notified of their failure to make payment, Islandnet may suspend the customer's access to the customer's files for as long as the customer does not pay for services rendered. Moreover, Islandnet reserves the right to delete the customer's files if the customer refuses to pay for services rendered and after a customer has terminated their account with Islandnet or Islandnet has terminated the customer's account.

Except where specifically asked to do so by the customer, Islandnet does not alter or otherwise manipulate or access customer Internet files.

## Credit Rating Information :

Credit rating information gathered in connection with a customer's application for service or other financing related application is used solely for the purpose of determining the customer's creditworthiness for the application in question and for no other purpose. Credit rating information is shared internally only and only with those people directly responsible for approving service, credit, and similar applications. Such credit rating information may be stored by Islandnet for as long as is the practice for storing customer information in general.

Where a prospective customer is declined for service, credit rating information is not retained by Islandnet and is destroyed in a secure manner.

Where customers do not pay or contest invoices within 150 days of Islandnet mailing or otherwise transmitting an invoice to the customer, Islandnet reserve the right to share information about the customer's payment practices with an appropriate credit reporting agency and to have such information become a permanent part of the customer's credit rating.

## Disposal of Customer Information :

When Islandnet disposes of customer information, all reasonable efforts are made to ensure the information cannot be retrieved, restored, or reconstituted in any way. Generally, "hard" (paper) documents are shredded and digital medium containing customer information is disposed of securely.
