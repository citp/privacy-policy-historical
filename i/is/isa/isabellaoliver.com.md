# Isabella Oliver Maternity Wear: For pregnancy in style.

**What we collect and why**

When you shop with Isabella Oliver, there are different ways we gather information about you:   


  * When you register with us, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, delivery address, contact details and, if you place an order, your credit card details which are encrypted so that they cannot be seen. We keep a record of this information. All this is necessary for us to recognise you as a registered customer and to fulfill the orders you place with us. 
  * We keep a record of your purchases with us; this means we can send you the most relevant offers. It also means we can deal a lot quicker with any problems you may experience with your order. 
  * We keep a record of any e-mail correspondence you send us. This helps us keep track of any problems or concerns you've had with our products or services. 



**Cookies**

Cookies are small text files that web sites can send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which tells a web site when the user has returned. Cookies are not computer programs, and can't read other information saved on your hard drive. They cannot be used to disseminate viruses, or get a user's e-mail address etc. They only contain and transfer to the web site as much information as the users themselves have disclosed to that web site. 

Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping basket or to remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit. The Isabella Oliver website uses cookies to allow customers to move from one part of the web site to another and to add items to the shopping basket without having to login repeatedly

The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "Directive"), which came into force on 31st July 2002, recognizes that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of web site users. The Directive makes it compulsory for web sites to inform users if cookies are being used (which is exactly what we are doing here!), and to provide some information on how cookies are used. You can find more information on this subject at www.cnil.fr/index.php?id=131 . Lastly, the Directive places an obligation on web sites to make users aware that they can set their computers to reject cookies. You will find the instructions on how to do this at www.cnil.fr/index.php?id=131 However, you should be aware that the Isabella Oliver website (in common with most other shopping web sites) will not work without cookies.

**Website security**

All Isabella Oliver online purchases take place in a safe environment using the latest security technology to protect our customers. 

We encrypt your credit card information to ensure your transactions with us are private and protected as they travel over the Internet. We accept orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection. Most web browsers above version 3 support this security. 

Your payment details are held in an encrypted format until we process your order. All orders are processed on computers that are not connected to the Internet. 

This encryption makes it virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read any information that you send us. 

The encryption technique we use is the highest standard available for e-commerce and certified by VeriSign, the world's most respected certification body for Internet firms. 

If you have questions regarding our credit card security policies, please call us on 0 844 844 0448.
