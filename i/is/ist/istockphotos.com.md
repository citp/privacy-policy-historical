### Please read this policy and if you have any questions contact us. 

### By using the site you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy. 

iStockphoto is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy tells you about our online collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The terms of this policy apply to all personal information collected by iStockphoto on the website istockphoto.com and other country-specific iStockphoto websites which may be linked to istockphoto.com. We have created this policy pursuant to the _Personal Information Protection Act_ (Alberta) S.A. 2003, c.P-6.5, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada) S.C. 2000, c.5 and the "Anti-Spam Act" (Canada) S.C. 2010, c.23. Your home jurisdiction may have privacy laws that are more or less protective than the province of Alberta, Canada. 

This site is operated by iStockphoto LP ("iStockphoto"), a subsidiary of Getty Images, Inc. ("Getty Images") and may be accessed in Canada and abroad. For personal information protection purposes in the European Union, iStockphoto is the controller and, unless otherwise noted, is also the processor of the personal information.

Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.

### Security of Your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information including without limitation: 

  * limiting access to your personal information to those of our employees who require it to provide services to you; 
  * requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements to protect customer and other confidential information; 
  * ensuring that third-party service providers sign confidentiality agreements to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and not to use it for any unauthorized purposes; 
  * personal information collected is retained as long as it is reasonably required for the purposes it was collected; 
  * encrypting credit card information on our order forms using secure socket layer (SSL) technology; and 
  * storing your personal information in secure computer systems which protect it from unauthorized access or use. 



No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. 

  


### Forums & Other Interactive Services

Our sites may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites ("Interactive Areas"). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including sending you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at [service@istockphoto.com](mailto:service@istockphoto.com). Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems. 

  


### Referrals

If you choose to use our referral services to tell a friend about our products or services (including images in your Lightbox, promotional campaigns, new websites, job postings, etc.), we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will use that information to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site, review the product or service you have selected and if they choose to join us, to track our referral services. We may use a third-party provider to administer this function, but any such third-party provider may only use the information submitted to facilitate this one-time email. 

If you are the person who was referred (either by email or otherwise, including through our referral program by clicking on a link on a third party site or email) and you choose to join us, your iStockphoto member name and any information you choose to put on your profile page may be viewable to the person that referred you so that they may track their referral services.
