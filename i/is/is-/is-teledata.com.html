<h1>Interactive Data: Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We value our relationship with you and respect your right to  privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how Interactive Data Corporation and our  applicable affiliates and subsidiaries handle personal information that you  provide to us or that we collect and maintain about you in connection with your  use of proprietary websites we currently operate (collectively the “Websites”)  and any other proprietary websites we may launch from time to time and the  services made available through the Websites (“Services”). By using the  Services or accessing our Websites, you are acknowledging that you have read  and understood this Privacy Policy and consent to the practices described  herein. </p>
<p>1) SCOPE OF POLICY.
</p><p>
  This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide  to us online or that we collect from you while visiting or using our  Websites or Services. It does not apply to information we obtain offline or  through other means. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies  that Interactive Data does not own or control or operators of third party  websites that you may access from the Websites or from which you may access the  Websites.</p>
<p>2) WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    a) We receive and store information that you voluntarily  provide when using the Websites and the Services. For example, when you  subscribe to our Services, we require you to provide personal information  including your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, facsimile  number, company affiliation, and other basic contact information. You may also  provide additional personal information to us when you voluntarily communicate  with us, such as when you request information, register for email updates or  listen to a webcast, submit application for employment, or when you post information  to the user content portion of the Websites.</p>
  <p>b) In addition to the information you voluntarily provide to  us, we automatically record information from your Internet browser, including  your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your computer's name, the  type and version of your web browser, the Internet addresses of the sites from  which you access the Websites (referring addresses) and other  generally-accepted log information. We may also record the presence of Interactive Data software or other third party software on  your computer, page views (hit counts) and other statistical and tracking  information, which are aggregated with website utilization information from  other users in order to understand how our Websites are being used. One or more  of the above activities may also be carried out by third parties we have  engaged to host certain portions or functions of or otherwise render services  in connection with our Websites, such as resume submission, or operating a  webcast on our behalf.</p>
  <p>c) While accessing and operating an Interactive Data  product, the Interactive Data software may record general statistical and  tracking information, such as the date and time a client accesses his or her  product and the time spent using it. The Interactive Data software transfers  this information to Interactive Data's servers, and such information is used  exclusively for internal resource management purposes.</p>
  <p>d) Cookies. We use common website management technologies  called cookies. A cookie is a small data file, which often includes a unique  but non-identifying code that is sent to your browser from a website's  computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to  provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to  use the Websites upon a future visit. Interactive Data will also use cookies to  recognize you when you return to our Websites. Our cookies are “persistent,” or  permanent, cookies, since they remain on your computer after you end your  visit, or “session,” on our Websites. Most web browsers are set to accept  cookies by default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature of your  browser. You should review the online documentation of your browser or consult  with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies.  If you disable cookies on your computer, some parts of our Websites may not be  available to you or may not function as intended.</p>
  <p>e) Referring Sites. Websites that contain links to our  Websites are known as “referring sites.” When you enter our Websites from a  referring site, we automatically collect information that identifies the  referring site and use this information to analyze which third party services  send visitors to our Websites and to present appropriate content to our  potential customers. Interactive Data tabulates referrer information on an  aggregate basis to identify Websites trends and traffic patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3) WHAT WE DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE. In  general we use the information we collect from and about you to provide  information and perform Services that you request, to improve our Websites and  Services, for our administrative and marketing purposes, and as otherwise  described in this Privacy Policy.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    a) Third Party Service Providers and Vendors. We share your  personally identifiable information with third parties with whom we contract  to: (i) distribute information relating to our Websites or Services, (ii)  maintain email alerts list and fulfill requests submitted via the Websites;  (iii) host certain portions or functions of our Websites (such as resume  submission or operating a webcast on our behalf); and/or (iv) provide technical  or professional services to us. </p>
  <p>b) Legal Compliance and Protection of Rights. We may share  your personally identifiable information with third parties, including law  enforcement agencies or others to the extent appropriate to comply with legal  requirements; to cooperate in a judicial or other legal proceeding; if we  believe that you have harmed, or interfered with (or will imminently harm or  interfere with) other Interactive Data users or anyone else; to enforce or  apply our Websites Terms and Conditions or other contractual commitments; or to  assert, defend, or protect our rights or property or the rights, property, health  or safety of our users or other persons. If we receive legal process calling  for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information we will  attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during the  registration within reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request,  unless such notification in not permitted.</p>
  <p>c) Business Transactions. We may disclose personal  information to third parties in connection with a potential or actual  transaction or proceeding involving a transfer of some or all of the businesses  or assets to which the information pertains. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4) ACCESS, CHANGING OR REMOVING PERSONAL INFORMATION. You  may update or request that we delete information that we maintain about you by  sending a request to the address provided in Section 11 below, in which case we  will update or remove your personally identifiable information from our  databases, except as necessary for  billing and  routine data archiving.</p>
<p>5) COMMUNICATIONS TO OUR USERS. Periodically, Interactive  Data will send news and information to parties who have expressed interest in  Interactive Data. We also may send these updates to persons who submit a  request for information via email on our Websites, register to receive email alerts  or register to listen to a webcast offered through the Websites. We may engage  a third party to distribute such information and updates or operate such  webcast on our behalf, which would require us to share your contact  information. You can stop receiving these communications by sending an email  request to the address listed in Section 11 below. As an alternative, you may  write to us with your request, at the mailing address set forth in Section 11.</p>
<p>6) SECURITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. Interactive  Data maintains controls to protect the information you provide us. Interactive  Data limits access to databases containing personally identifiable information  to employees who have a need to access the information. We have put in place  security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you  provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and  others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet  communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot assure that the  information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by  third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access. Data  covered by this Privacy Policy may be maintained and processed in the United States of America  among countries in which Interactive Data operates. Interactive Data Corporation adheres to the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, including the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce  for personally identifiable information that is within the scope of the Interactive Data  Corporation Safe  Harbor self-certification and that is  transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland  to the United States,  subject to annual verification by internal assessment. Further information about the Safe Harbor  frameworks is available at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
<p>7) LINKS TO OTHER SITES. The Websites may contain links to  other web sites operated by third parties not affiliated with Interactive Data.  The inclusion of any link to such third party sites does not imply endorsement  by Interactive Data of those sites. We have not reviewed the sites linked to  the Websites and are not responsible for the data-handling practices of any  such sites.</p>
<p>8) CHILDREN. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted  to register for the Services and Interactive Data does not knowingly collect,  either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons  under the age of 18. If we learn that a child under the age of 18 has provided  us with personally identifiable information, we will attempt to delete this  information from our databases, subject to any technical limitations on our  ability to do so. </p>
<p>9) NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES. Interactive Data may change or  modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post notice of the new or  revised policy from the Privacy Policy link on the home page of our Websites.  Your use of our Websites following any such change constitutes your agreement  to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed. If we make any  significant changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information  to third parties, we will attempt to notify you prior to the date the modified  policy takes effect.</p>
<p>10)� YOUR CONSENT. By  using the Websites, you consent to our collection and use of your information,  in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with some, or all  of the terms of this Privacy Policy, you may not become a Subscriber, or  otherwise visit the Websites.</p>
<p>11) CONTACT US. You may contact us by email or traditional  mail at the following addresses: </p><p>

  </p><p>12) In the event you access websites operated by Interactive  Data Desktop Solutions such as, but not limited to the www.esignal.com and the  www.esignallearning.com websites (collectively the “Interactive Data Desktop  Solutions Websites”) as well as any other websites Interactive Data Desktop  Solutions may launch from time to time the following additional provisions  shall apply:</p>
<p>12.1 What Information We Collect and Use </p><p>
  In addition to the information set forth in Section 2 above,  Interactive Data collects information from users at different points on our  Interactive Data Desktop Solutions Websites and through our software, as  follows: </p><p>
  12.1.1 Registration: In order to subscribe to Interactive  Data Desktop Solutions products and services, we require that you complete a  registration form. This form may ask for contact information, such as name,  address, email address, telephone number, company name, fax number and other  basic contact information ("Registration Information"). After  submitting your Registration Information, you can view and modify this  information within the self-maintenance area of the Interactive Data Desktop  Solutions Websites. You agree to notify Interactive Data Desktop Solutions of  any change to your billing address within thirty (30) days of such change. </p><p>
  12.1.2. Orders and Requests: When you subscribe to an  Interactive Data Desktop Solutions product or service, we request the  appropriate billing information on our order form. This information includes  your credit card number, expiration date and billing address ("Order  Information"). Order Information is kept with your Registration  Information in a database and will be retained for future purchases. </p><p>
  12.1.3. Partners: Interactive Data Desktop Solutions may  enter into agreements with other companies that market software or services  that either function similarly to Interactive Data Desktop Solutions software  or that enhance or extend Interactive Data Desktop Solutions’ functionality.  Some of these may be third party products that may utilize components of  Interactive Data Desktop Solutions software. Under the terms of these  agreements, we may be required to collect information about your sessions and  your use of these third party products and share this information with these  third parties. </p><p>
  12.1.4. Third Party Advertising Companies: We use  third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Interactive  Data Desktop Solutions Websites. These companies may use information (not  including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your  visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about  goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about  this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used  by these companies, click here. </p><p>
  12.1.5. Providers: A provider is an entity that agrees to  pay for the Interactive Data Desktop Solutions services being provided to you.  We have entered into contractual agreements with these providers governing the  provider arrangement. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to  collect information about your sessions and your use of your Interactive Data  Desktop Solutions product and share this information, along with your  personally identifiable information, with the provider paying for your  Interactive Data Desktop Solutions service. This information is kept strictly  confidential, and is not shared with other third parties, except as provided  for in this Privacy Policy. </p><p>
  12.1.6 Access to Information: If you are a resident of  Australia, on request, we will provide you with access to personal information  that we hold about you collected when you visit our Website or use our Services  (unless there is an exception that applies under Australian privacy laws, such  as where we have a legal duty of confidentiality). Your request to obtain  access will be dealt with in a reasonable time. We may recover from you the  reasonable cost of providing you with access. </p><p>
  12.2 What We Do with Information We Collect and Use </p><p>
  In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not  disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties  without your express consent or allowing you to decline to permit the  disclosure. There are, however, some limited circumstances, in addition to  those set forth in section 3 above,� in  which we may need to disclose personally identifiable information about a user  without express consent, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set  forth below: </p><p>
  12.2.1. Interactive Data Desktop Solutions Website Vendors:  We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such  providing customer service, sending print and electronic mail, processing  credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. In order to  allow these companies to perform their obligations, we may need to share your  personally identifiable information with them. However, we will provide these  companies with only that information necessary to perform their functions on  our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable  information for any other purpose. </p><p>
  12.2.2. Resellers: Interactive Data Desktop Solutions may  from time to time enter into agreements with companies that resell Interactive  Data Desktop Solutions’ products or services, either on Interactive Data  Desktop Solutions’ behalf, or on their own behalf on a private labeled basis  and/or on a co-branded basis. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be  required, and therefore we reserve the right, to share your personally  identifiable information with such resellers. Once your personally identifiable  information is provided to such resellers, it will no longer be covered by this  privacy policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information  will be governed by the privacy policy of the resellers to whom it is provided.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Interactive Data Desktop Solutions will not  share your Order Information with any reseller that is not billing you directly  for the re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded Interactive Data  services to which you subscribe. </p><p>
  12.2.3. Interactive Data Publishers and Merchants:  Interactive Data reserves the right to provide to publishers and other  merchants for whom Interactive Data Desktop Solutions sells or distributes  products or services any personally identifiable information as is necessary to  fulfill any requests you may make for their products or services. In addition,  merchants of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through  Interactive Data Desktop Solutions may request additional personally identifiable  information from you. Interactive Data Desktop Solutions will provide the  merchants of such products the information you supply in response to those  requests and, following such disclosure by Interactive Data Desktop Solutions,  your personally identifiable information will no longer be covered by this  policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information is  governed by the privacy policy of the merchants whose products you have  purchased or to which you have subscribed. </p><p>
  12.2.4. Required by Law: Interactive Data Desktop Solutions  will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we  reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process  calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information  we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during  registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the  request, unless such notification is not permitted. </p><p>
  12.3 Changing or Removing Personal Information; Opting Out </p><p>
  To ensure that you have appropriate control over your  personally identifiable information, you can access your account (after  supplying your user name and password) in the Self-Maintenance area of our  Interactive Data Desktop Solutions Websites to update and/or correct the  information you have previously submitted. 
  </p><p>
  In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline --  or “opt-out of” -- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these  materials, you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following  directions provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as further detailed in  Section 12.4 (Communications to our Users) of our Privacy Policy, below. 
  </p><p>
  Finally, if you request, we will  remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our active  databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this  information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to  remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our  database, please create an email with the term “Unsubscribe” in the subject  line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 12.7 of this Privacy  Policy. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the  mailing address set forth in Section 12.7. You will be removed from our  databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request.  You may also request to review or amend any personal information that we maintain  about you, by sending a written request to the same address, subject to our  verification of your identity acceptance of any proposed revision. </p><p>

Interactive Data Desktop Solutions can  no longer update any of your personally identifiable information once it has  been transferred to such third parties and cannot implement or impose your opt  out requests upon such third parties. Instead, you must either contact that  third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally  identifiable information or to let the third party know that you no longer want  to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products,  services or offerings. </p><p>
