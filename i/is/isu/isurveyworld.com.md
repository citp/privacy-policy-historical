## What personally identifiable information does IsurveyWorld collect from me? 

  


### "IsurveyWorld collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of websites.   
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, IsurveyWorld asks for your name, email address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to IsurveyWorld and you can access the various protected areas of the site.   
From time to time, we may use tracking mechanisms such as cookies or web beacons to observe your behavior across multiple websites. We share the information we gather with third parties who serve targeted advertisements to you based on your browsing behaviors. These advertisements are served to you on multiple third party websites. If you do not wish to have your activity and browsing behaviors tracked, you may opt out by contacting our customer support team at support@isurveyworld.com or selecting the opt-out button located on the ""My Account"" page.   
Also, if you contact iSurveyWorld we may keep a record of that correspondence.   
Whenever iSurveyWorld collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. "

## What are cookies and how does iSurveyWorld use them? 

  


### A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, iSurveyWorld may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. Some areas on iSurveyWorld where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. This avoids you having to enter your login information many times in one day. 

## Who is collecting information and for what purpose? 

  


### "iSurveyWorld collects valuable information which assists in developing new products and services. When you are on a iSurveyWorld site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with iSurveyWorld alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than iSurveyWorld, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.   
Promotions that run on IsurveyClub may be sponsored by companies other than iSurveyWorld or may be co-sponsored by iSurveyWorld and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared.   
Any Sensitive Information (i.e. personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual) will be treated with additional care. If iSurveyWorld intends to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a different purpose than originally collected, then you will be expressly asked permission prior to any such disclosure.   
Please be aware that iSurveyWorld advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to iSurveyWorld are not covered by this privacy statement. "

## With whom does iSurveyWorld share my information?

If any personal data about you were ever to be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.   
Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give iSurveyWorld permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.   
From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, iSurveyWorld will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them.   
Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, iSurveyWorld may match user information with third party data. Also, IsurveyWorld discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.   
Other: iSurveyWorld may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating IsurveyWorld's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) IsurveyWorld's rights or property, other IsurveyWorld users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. IsurveyWorld may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services."
