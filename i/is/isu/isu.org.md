# Privacy Policy - International Skating Union

Data and its protection are becoming increasingly more important to individuals and enterprises. The European Union (EU) enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) which will be enforced starting May 25, 2018. The GDPR is designed to give EU residents better control over their personal data regardless of where data is sent, processed or stored by establishing one set of data protection rules across the EU.

The International Skating Union is committed to protect your personal data and committed to GDPR compliance having members from the EU and being active on EU territory.

This Policy explains when and why we collect personal information, how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.

We may change this Policy from time to time so please check this page occasionally to ensure that you are happy with any changes.

Any questions regarding this Policy and our privacy practices should be sent by email to [media@isu.ch](mailto:media@isu.ch)

or by writing to:  
International Skating Union - Avenue Juste-Olivier 17, 1006 Lausanne - Switzerland.

We will collect information about you in different situations, for instance when you register on our Services, when you contact us or when you request a service from us.
