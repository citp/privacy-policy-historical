# Issuu - Terms of Service

**Last Updated: July 28th, 2015**

**PLEASE NOTE: The Issuu Privacy Policy is effective as of the "Last Updated" date above. (See[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181229175957id_/https%3A//issuu.com/legal/privacy/2015february) for the previous version of the Privacy Policy.)**

Issuu, Inc. operates the Issuu service and related services, applications, domains and networks offered by Issuu ("Issuu Service"). The Issuu Service allows you to connect, collaborate, share, and remix documents with other users of the Issuu Service community on the Internet. Issuu’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use your information. By using or accessing the Issuu Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Issuu Service to stay informed about our information practices. 

##  Information Gathered by Issuu 

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of “personally identifiable” information (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or “non-personally identifiable” information (meaning it cannot be used to specifically identify you) that we may collect in your use of the Issuu Service. We use both types of information, and combinations of both types. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any other company or individual that we do not own or control. 

**Visitors:** For visitors to our website and registered users, we log certain information, such as your IP address, browser type and usage data, for example, how much time you spent reading, which publications you read, and which pages you accessed. In addition, if you access the Issue Service via our mobile application, we also collect mobile device IDS such as IDFA (iOS) and Android ID. 

**Registration:** If you choose to register with us, Issuu may ask you to provide your name, email address and physical address. Issuu also asks each user to create an account ID and password. Issuu may ask you to provide demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation to enhance our ability to provide a more personalized experience for users. We may also, via a third party service, collect credit card information for any paid services or purchases. 

**Feedback and Chat:** We may collect other information when you provide feedback or comments or communicate with others through our systems. 

**Info through other services:** You may give us permission to collect your information in other services. For example, you may create an account via a social networking service ("SNS") such as Facebook, Google Plus or Twitter . When you do this, it allows us to obtain information from those accounts (for example, your friends or contacts) either automatically in accordance with their terms or as a result of your selections in the SNS. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons:** Issuu uses "cookies" – small files containing a string of characters sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser – in addition to Flash shared browser objects to administer its website and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example, we may use cookies or Flash objects to count the number of unique computers accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from the Issuu Service if you choose. When you access the Issuu Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include IP Address, a unique ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Issuu Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Issuu Service. You can usually instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Issuu Service or all functionality of the Issuu Service. 

##  Information Gathered by Third Party Analytics Services and Ad Networks 

We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies such as software development kits in the Issuu Service. These companies may collect information such as unique device identifiers, IP address, geolocation, OS information, and user activity. For example, we work with third parties, such as Flurry Inc., to provide analytics information regarding your use of the Issuu Service. For more information about Flurry's privacy practices, please visit [here](http://www.flurry.com/legal-privacy/privacy-policy-updated). To opt-out of Flurry Analytics tracking used with the issuu iOS mobile application visit [this site](http://www.flurry.com/legal-privacy/end-user-opt-out). 

Some of the advertisements you see on the Issuu Service are delivered by advertisers or through ad networks which collect information about you and your activities through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. These advertisers or ad networks may include, but are not limited to Google AdSense, MoPub, Criteo, AdRoll, VelisMedia, SayMedia and Q1Media. The use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies by these companies is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), each of which offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from its member companies. To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page located at: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. To opt out of information collection by DAA member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page located at: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. Mobile device operating system software such as Apple iOS and Google Play Services provide an opt-out choice e.g., Limit Ad Tracking on iOS. To opt-out, the User should consult the User’s device settings.

We transmit your credit or debit card account information to these third parties, but do not store such information. We cannot guarantee that transmissions of your credit or debit card account information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the security measures taken by us or our third-party service providers.
