  <p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
  <p>    Welcome to <strong>iSocial Academy</strong> (the "Site").</p>
  <p>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site,   especially when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy   policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit   without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact   business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by <strong>iSocial Academy</strong> (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").</p>
  <p><strong>"Personally Identifiable Information"</strong><br>
    refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify,   contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains,   including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number,   email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit   card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include   information that is collected anonymously (that is, without   identification of the individual user)or demographic information not   connected to an identified individual.</p>
  <p><strong>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </strong><br>
    We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.   We collect the following additional information from our Authorized   Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of   Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the   nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized   Customer intends to purchase or sell.</p>
  <p><strong>What organizations are collecting the information? </strong><br>
    In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party   service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and   banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow   services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized   Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such   information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal   information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers.   Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as   links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the   information given to them.</p>
  <p><strong>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
    We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to   make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling   requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers   about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or   information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use   Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized   Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested   information. <a href="http://www.weblawgenerator.com/"><img src="http://www.schoolforthought.com/index_clip_image001.gif" alt="website legal forms" border="0" height="1" width="1"></a>While   actual use of any Personal Information may be quite conservative, it   may be used for general solicitation by this Website or other entities   it is sold to, rented or shared with.</p>
  <p><strong>With whom may the information may be shared?</strong><br>
    Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be   shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential   transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated   information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our   Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and   third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of   receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting   on our behalf.</p>
  <p><strong>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?</strong><br>
    Personally Identifiable Information collected by <strong>iSocial Academy</strong> is securely stored and is not accessible to third parties or employees of <strong>iSocial Academy</strong> except for use as indicated above. <img src="http://www.schoolforthought.com/index_clip_image001_0000.gif" alt="TrafficAgentServer 1.01 " border="0" height="1" width="1"></p>
  <p><strong>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?</strong><br>
    Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited   information from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and   affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by   contacting us</p>
  <p><strong>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</strong><br>
    Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain   information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they   select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our   Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged   on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will   automatically log the Authorized Customer off.</p>
  <p><strong>How does iSocial Academy&nbsp;use login information?<br>
  </strong><strong>iSocial Academy</strong> uses login information,   including, but not limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and browser types, to   analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement and use,   and gather broad demographic information.</p>
  <p><strong>What partners or service providers have access to Personally   Identifiable Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on   the Site?</strong><br>
    <strong>iSocial Academy</strong> has entered into and will continue to enter into partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors.<br>
    Such vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable   Information on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers   for service eligibility.<br>
    Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information.<br>
    Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law. We   will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply   with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement   agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally   Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety   of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.</p>
  <p><strong>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</strong><br>
    All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and   practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and   Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified   employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the   information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular   basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social   security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to   protect information sent over the Internet. While we take commercially   reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications   and databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we   cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place and we   will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such   occurrences.</p>
  <p><strong>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
    Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally   Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by   emailing us</p>
  <p><strong>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</strong><br>
    We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to   delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's   database by contacting contact us. However, because of backups and   records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry   without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests   to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this   information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use   Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any   way moving forward.</p>
  <p><strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</strong><br>
    We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to   our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we   are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure   of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized   Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such   Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized   Customer to prevent such disclosure.</p>
