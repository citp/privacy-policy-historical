We also may disclose Personal Information when we have reason to believe that someone has committed, or will commit, unlawful acts or acts that endanger the health or safety of another; is causing injury to, or interference with, our rights or property, other suers of the Website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. In some situations, we may share you rPersonal Information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails from a lawyer under our direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">3.10 Disclaimer</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from this Website or other websites owned by the Company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4. SECURITY</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4.1 General</span></p><p class="c2"><span>No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of the Web Site to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, including in the case of your contacting us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website. Accordingly, though the Website may take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4.2 Children</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The Website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 or for children between the ages of 13 and 17, except in accordance with the Terms of Service. No one under the age 13 is authorized to provide any Personal Information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chat rooms. The Website does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4.3 Phishing</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Identity theft is a continuing global problem, with unauthorized individuals or companies to send e-mail messages and and other correspondence to consumers, purporting to be a legitimate representative. For example, a bank or online merchant requesting sensitive account or payment information. Although the correspondence may appear to be from the domain and account of a legitimate source, in reality, sometimes it's illegally spoofed in hopes of collecting such sensitive information.
