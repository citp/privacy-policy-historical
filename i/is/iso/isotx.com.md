**PRIVACY POLICY**

ISOTX  
IPsotx Sàrl  
Boulevard de la Foire 1  
L-1528 Luxembourg

Last revised: April 23, 2013

ISOTX has created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our software (“Software”), and Web sites (“Site”) located at [http://www.isotx.com](http://www.isotx.com/) and all subdomains. By using the Site and the Software, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.

We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last revised” date set forth above and notify each active user asking them to confirm their acceptance of the new policy. The updated Policy will govern each use of the Site from the date of update forward. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the Site.

**INFORMATION ABOUT YOU**

We collect three basic types of information with our Site and Software, namely personal information, individual usage patterns and aggregate information. Personal information is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user’s e-mail address, usage information and user-chosen ID and password.

Individual Usage Patterns includes information automatically collected by the Software about your game play (including frequency and type of games played), and usage patterns of the Site, the Software and the third party software downloaded through the Software.

Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our Site and Software may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Site and Software. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services.

You send us this data in two ways. First, you send data actively, either directly or through your account and privacy settings on a social networking site like Facebook. Second, your computer automatically transmits information when you use the Services. The information you send automatically consists of (a) technical information about your computer – including but not limited to IP address, MAC address, operating system, browser type, referring and exit URLs, and (b) Service usage information – including but not limited to your interaction with the Site and the Services, games played, game scores, use of virtual currency, (collectively, “Automatically Collected Information”).

Automatically Collected Information can be collected among other, through server log files, cookies and pixel tags. We may store such information in databases owned and maintained by affiliated or non-affiliated service providers.  
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected in any other way than as listed above, e.g., any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products that you may email us, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and ISOTX shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

**NO INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN**

Our Services are not suited for children under the age of 13 and we do not allow children to access any Services. If you are under the age of 13, do not submit any information to us. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide information on the Service. Children under the age of 18 using our products are assumed to have parental consent. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to ISOTX through the Service, please contact us at legal@isotx.com, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**INTERNAL USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

All information collected is stored in our database and may be archived elsewhere.

We use the information you transmit, including personal data, for a variety of reasons, including to:

  * communicate with you on information of interest and respond to requests,
  * operate, maintain and improve the Site and Services;
  * enable you to connect with friends;
  * provide you with personalized ads and product offers;
  * perform analytics for internal marketing and demographic studies;
  * troubleshoot technical concerns including administrative and store related issues;
  * develop new products;
  * administer rewards, surveys, contests and other promotional activities;
  * process in-game purchases;
  * identify, research and protect against actual, potential or threatened misuse, unauthorized use, unwanted use or other forms of fraud and abuse of the Service;
  * enable third party hosts of the Site or the Services; and
  * as deemed necessary, in our sole discretion, to ensure the safety or integrity of our users, employees, third parties, our Site and Services.



**HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION**  
We share your information (including personal data) with third parties in the following circumstances:

Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data may be part of the transferred assets.

Service Providers: We provide information to distributors and affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for their use in performing services on our behalf by enabling our partners to place cookies or pixel tags on our websites, under agreements that protect the confidentiality and security of such information. These include, but are not limited to, payment processors, advertisers, providers of chat services. The information collected is not shared with third parties or used by the service provider for its own purposes.

Business Partners: ISOTX may work with advertising vendors who collect non-personally identifiable data about your visit to the Sites and other websites in order to serve you with more personalized targeted ads and to verify campaign results.  Although these companies use some anonymous information about you to display ads while you are browsing the internet, we do not permit these companies to collect any personal information about you.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by Third Party Advertisers, and ISOTX cannot be held responsible for misuse of collection methods and/or abuse of collected data by affiliated and non-affiliated third parties. For this, refer to the partner’s own privacy policy. For information on how to opt-out of such cookies, go to the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. [You can find the opt-out page here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Legal Requirements: ISOTX may disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of ISOTX, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

**THIRD PARTY PRIVACY PRACTICES**

The Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by ISOTX through your use of the Service. Other websites may be accessible through links from our Site or when using the Services. Certain business partners may collect data through the use of cookies or pixel tags. This data collection is subject to the terms of their privacy policies. ISOTX is not responsible for any content appearing on those websites or any privacy or security practices for those websites.

**NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY**

To protect your personal data, ISOTX maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personal data you have provided. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite our reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your information. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal data to ISOTX via the Internet. By using our Services, you assume this risk. Please note that you should keep your account and password strictly confidential at all times.

**ACCESS AND CONTROL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If you are a registered user of our Site, you may view, correct, and delete your personal information through the Site. Generally, you should be careful when making any personal information available to the public.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to our Software and Site, such as but not limited to customer service responses and other administrative messages.

A request to delete your account may not result in removal of information collected that has been put in aggregate form, or information that cannot, in our sole discretion, be removed without undue burden by ISOTX, including data stored on our servers and the servers of social networking services. ISOTX may also be required to retain certain purchasing information for compliance purposes.

**INTERNATIONAL USERS**

By using our Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of ISOTX, we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this policy or in our other communications with you, including the transmission of information outside your resident jurisdiction. IPsotx Sàrl is based in Luxembourg and operates under Luxembourg law. Please note that your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your country. If you object to your personal information being transferred or used as described in this Policy, please do not register for the Site or use the Software.

**UPDATING THIS POLICY**

We may revise and update this Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new services or change existing ones. Any changes will be posted to this document so that you will always know what information we gather and how we use it. If we make any material changes to our Policy or how we handle your personal information, we will post an updated Policy on our site and change the date of the Policy. If we are going to use any personal information in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change. We will use information in accordance with the most current privacy policy.
