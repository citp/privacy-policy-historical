We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site.

We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information. [](http://www.weblawgenerator.com/)While actual use of any Personal Information may be quite conservative, it may be used for general solicitation by this Website or other entities it is sold to, rented or shared with.

Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential transactions with other Authorized Customers.
