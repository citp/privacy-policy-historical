  sign-up, the number of transactions you have completed, and other
  information may be viewed by other users.
</p>

  to anyone you have entered in a transaction with, except with your
  express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a
  subpoena or other legal process.
</p>
<p>
  We may share your personal information with:
</p>

      <li>we need to do so to comply with law
      </li>
      <li>we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal
      information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial
      loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate
      violations of our User Agreement.
