### Introduction

iSpring Solutions, Inc. and its affiliates (hereinafter referred as “iSpring”) respects your right to privacy and we understand that, when you visit our website, use our products and services or otherwise interact with us (for example, by viewing our webinars), you prefer to control the way you share your personal information (“Personal Data”) and preferences. iSpring offers a wide range of products, including desktop products, our web based services, custom and support services. We refer to all of these products, together with our other services and websites as "Services" in this Privacy Policy. 

The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refers to iSpring. The terms “user”, “you”, and “your” refer to site visitors, customers and any other users of the site. 

iSpring provides this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to inform you of our practices with respect to the collection and use of your Personal Data. 

iSpring complies with the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“GDPR”). iSpring acts as both a data controller and a data processor under GDPR. 

iSpring has implemented the following requirements under the GDPR, including but not limited to: 

  * A record of our Personal Data processing activities;
  * Adequate organizational and technical protection measures;
  * Request forms and internal instructions for Privacy by Design & Default, Data Portability, Data Subject Rights like the Right to be Forgotten. 



We collect information globally and primarily store that information on the servers based in the United States and Germany. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. The Personal Data of individuals from EEA and Switzerland is stored on servers based in Germany and processed in the United States. Regardless of where your information is stored or processed, we apply the same protection described in this Policy. iSpring offers European builds of desktop products to individuals from EEA and Switzerland to store the information we collect from your use of the Services on the servers in Germany. We also use the model contract clauses approved by European Commission as a means of ensuring adequate protection when transferring data outside of the EEA and Switzerland. By incorporating model contract clauses into a contract established between the parties transferring data, personal data can be protected when transferred outside the EEA to countries which have not been deemed by the European Commission to adequately protect personal data. 

### Agreement to this Policy

If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Services. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time.

  * In certain situations, iSpring may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 



### iSpring in its role as processor

**_Personal information and content you provide through iSpring web based services._** When customers and iSpring partners use iSpring web based services to process Personal Data in their content, iSpring acts as a data processor. The customer of iSpring that owns an account in iSpring web based services, will be responsible for determining the purposes and means of the processing of the content and any Personal Data provided by end users of the account, and this iSpring customer (or its end users) will be the data controller in regards to such processing. 

The owner of an account in iSpring web based services has the right to update the email address associated with his account or deactivate an account by submitting a written request to support@ispringsolutions.com. 

If at any time iSpring has access to Personal Data stored in the account owned by an iSpring customer, then iSpring shall be a data sub-processor, and any actions performed by iSpring in relation to such data shall be solely governed by the agreement concluded between us and the iSpring customer. iSpring offers a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum (DPA) that incorporates iSpring’s commitments as data processor. 

### Legal bases for processing

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases: 

  * **_Performance of a contract:_** the use of your information is necessary to provide you the Services, customer support and personalized features. If you order and use our Services, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Services under the contract that we have with you; 
  * **_Legitimate interests:_** the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, namely for information security. We also want to provide you with the best suitable content of the website, to improve and promote our products and services and the content on our website, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes; 
  * **_Consent:_** we may rely on your consent to use your Personal Data for specific purposes, for example, for sending newsletters and for certain direct marketing purposes. 



### How we store and secure information we collect

**_Information storage._** We use data hosting service providers in the United States and Germany to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. 

**_Technical and organizational security procedures and data transfers._** We observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to, and the misuse of Personal Data. We use appropriate business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard the Personal Data. We also use security procedures and technical and physical restrictions for accessing and using the Personal Data on our servers. Only authorized personnel are permitted to access Personal Data in the course of their work. 

For more information on where we store your information and our security measures please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below. 

Because iSpring is a company with customers located in many different countries around the world, it is important that we comply with data privacy laws in many jurisdictions. In our role as data processor we have implemented the model contractual clauses to enable the lawful transfer of Personal Data from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States. The Standard Contractual Clauses set out iSpring commitment to privacy and data protection when processing data in connection with the provision of products and services to our customers and partners, and dealing with the transfer of Personal Data outside the EEA and Switzerland in connection with the provision of such products and services. If you are a customer or partner that specifically requires the implementation of model contractual clauses directly with iSpring, where appropriate and where iSpring is a data processor for the customer or partner, please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below. 

### How long we keep information (retention procedures)

iSpring will store your personal information as long as necessary to perform the purposes of processing as stated in this Policy. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. 

**_Site account information:_** We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you. 

**_Information you share on the Services:_** If your site account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided. 

**_Managed accounts:_** If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. 

**_Marketing information:_** If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your iSpring site account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.
