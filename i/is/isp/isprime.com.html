<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 7pt">ISPrime respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites, responds to our interactive advertisements or sends us e-mail. This Privacy Statement outlines the information

<b>II. Security</b><br>

  </font>

  </p>

<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 7pt">All order forms on ISPrime.com utilize a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol to provide "secure sessions" for our visitors. Through the "secure session," information that you input into a 
ISPrime.com order form will be sent and will arrive privately and unaltered at a 
ISPrime server. This security prohibits other companies and Web users from being able to access your information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 7pt">ISPrime has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under 18 years of age. Where appropriate, 
ISPrime will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our Web sites or advertisements without consent of a parent or guardian.
