<p>
Your privacy is important to iSpot.tv, Inc. ("iSpot"). This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the iSpot Web
sites ("Sites"). This Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by
iSpot.
</p>
<h2>Personal Information Collected</h2>
<p>
We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Sites and Applications. We may
collect personal information you directly provide on our Sites. In addition, we may collect personal
information from you as a user of our Applications. Information we may collect includes name and email
address, and phone number.
</p>
<p>
In addition, when you visit our Sites some information may be automatically collected. For example, it is
standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit including
ours. That information includes your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser
type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about your
computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on our Sites. We use this
information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track
users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user-base as a
whole.
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data
files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us
to improve our Sites and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are most
popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Sites, to personalize your experience, and to
remember your preferences.
</p>
<p>
We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit
while on our site. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not
be able to access certain features or services of our Sites. The use of cookies by our service providers
is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our
service providers use session ID cookies to collect data in order to enable us to provide a better user
experience.
</p>
<h2>Web Beacons</h2>
<p>
We and our third party partners use Web beacons that help us better manage content on our site by
informing us what content is effective. Web beacons, also known as gifs, are electronic images that
may be used on our Sites or in our emails. A Web beacon may be used on our Web pages to collect
information, deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, or in our emails
to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us
know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
communications.
</p>
<h2>Use Of Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
We use your personal information to provide you with services, to operate and improve our Sites and
Applications, to send you messages, and for other purposes described in this Policy or disclosed to you

    <li>to apply to become a partner;</li>
    <li>to personalize and improve your experience on our Sites and with our Applications;</li>
    <li>to respond to comments and questions and provide customer service;</li>
    <li>to deliver service messages and other services and content you request and to send
        information related to accounts and services, including confirmations, invoices, technical
        notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;</li>

We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services, an email service
provider to send out emails on our behalf, a company to provide our forums and an employment
resources company to process your job applications. When you sign up for our services, we will share
the personal information you provide only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
</p>
<p>
We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as described above and
as follows:

    <li>with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers ("Service Providers")
    who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their
    work for us;</li>
    <li>to (a) comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process, (b) to protect
    the rights and property of iSpot, our agents, members, and others including to enforce

    needed to respond to an emergency or protect the personal safety of any person; and</li>

    <li>in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or
    a portion of our business to another company. In any such event, we will provide notice if

misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however,
that despite our efforts, no security measures are impenetrable.
