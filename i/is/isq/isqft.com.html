		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h2>iSqFt is committed to protecting your privacy online. In order to fully understand your rights, please read this privacy statement before using the iSqFt website (the "Site"), or any website that is powered by iSqFt.</h2>
	</div>

	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">When does iSqFt collect personally identifiable information?</p>
	<p>iSqFt gathers information from visitors in four ways: registration, cookie technology, IP addresses and participation in the services available on the Site.</p>
	<p><strong>Registration.</strong> When you register at the Site, we collect information which allows us to identify you. The more information you provide, the better we are able to customize our services and your experience to suit your needs and preferences.</p>
	<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We use cookies to store and track your preferences to provide you with a more customized experience. A cookie is a message that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet sites use cookies. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies but then you will not be able access our site.</p>
	<p><strong>IP Address.</strong> We also log IP addresses for the purpose of systems administration and site security. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. When you visit a particular web page in the Site, our servers log your IP address.</p>

	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">How is personally identifiable information used?</p>
	<p><strong>Customized Look and Feel.</strong> iSqFt gathers information to provide you with an effortless experience. For instance, your personal information enables us to greet you when you return to our Site and to provide you with your specified preferences (e.g., Site look and feel and preferred categories).</p>
	<p><strong>Email.</strong> If you register with our Site, from time to time, we may email you with informative messages about our services we believe may be of interest to you, notify you of project changes. General Contractors may also use iSqFt to invite you to bid on projects or to provide ongoing project information.</p>
	<p><strong>Registered User Areas.</strong> If you have access to certain areas of the Site because you are a Registered User ("Registered User Areas"), the Registered User Areas may contain groups, discussions, member profiles, comment areas, blogs and similar areas where Registered Users can share information about themselves and their opinions, as well as post questions. Information you post to a Registered User Area may be viewed, accessed, or collected by, or disclosed to, other Registered Users and may be used by other Registered Users in ways neither you nor iSqFt are able to control or predict, including, without limitation, disclosure of your information to the public or to contact you for unauthorized purposes.  By using the Registered User Areas, you hereby acknowledge and agree that any information you share in a Registered User Area (including, without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information) is available to other Registered Users and to iSqFt for use as provided herein.</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">With whom does iSqFt share information?</p>
	<p>We maintain mutual sharing agreements with our strategic business partners for the express purpose of providing our joint customers with opportunities to receive information about valuable products and services. We will not disclose your personal information to any other third parties except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. We may also share your profile information &amp; project activity with third parties if you click on a publicly posted project or with those subscribers who created a project if you click on their privately invited project.</p>
	<p>iSqFt may allow third parties to display advertisements on the Site. iSqFt and these third parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view and interact with these advertisements and connect to the Site.</p>
	<p>iSqFt may use third party ad servers or vendors to serve or present the ads that appear on the Site and to conduct research about the advertisements. Any of these ad servers may collect non-personal information, such as your browser, operating system, date/time of viewing, IP address and clickstream data. The use of first-party cookies (such as Google Analytics) or third-party cookies (such as Doubleclick) help inform, optimize and serve ads based on the users past visits to the Site. iSqFt cannot control the activities of such advertisers or web sites. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH AD SERVERS.</p>
	<p>The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is a cooperative group of ad serving providers. The NAI has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere. The NAI is committed to providing consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet generally. For more information about the NAI, third party ad servers generally and the opt-out options offered through the NAI, visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp</a>.</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">What are my options to control the use of personal information?</p>
	<p>Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. However, again remember that if you reject cookies you will not be able to access our site. Residual information may remain in our archives and records, but this information will not be used for a commercial purpose. We reserve the right to maintain information on registered visitors who have violated any of our policies or who have had their access to the Site blocked.</p>

	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">What if want to opt-out?</p>
	<p>If you wish to opt out of Google's use of cookies, you may do so by visiting Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TCgL_x1WcIxTXnHiVa-R-xWftxxhVUxJhPilCafpPLM0B3FqkzfUNGaErrC46XlDq56xt5lRmbhhOri_iH09C7ZWdfjUCDM1_AJVHGewgVjNUAM9Xxjpn3MQ-FEzAXDSl5OOC8HUMEOCk6qkzN9S69rxsC-knVHTAFTfDLeMCoL24PV7ewI" target="_blank">Ads Settings</a>. Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">What else should I know about my privacy?</p>
	<p>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online in a public area, that information may be viewed and used by others. Furthermore, users who choose to list their profile in the iSqFt Network make that information available to subscribers who may be searching for qualified bidders.</p>
	<p>iSqFt may disclose any information, including without limitation Personally Identifiable Information, that iSqFt deems necessary, in its sole discretion and without your prior permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. iSqFt also may exchange information, including without limitation Personally Identifiable Information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection, risk reduction and related activities or to protect the rights, property of safety of iSqFt and its agents, employees or affiliates or others. iSqFt reserves the right to disclose a user's Personally Identifiable Information if iSqFt believes the user is in violation of iSqFt's Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order.</p>
	<p>Please remember that you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use on the Site.</p>

	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">What if I live in California?</p>
	<p>If you are a resident of California ("California Users"), in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you generally have the right to request information from iSqFt regarding the manner in which iSqFt shares certain categories of Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
	<p>Under the law, however, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>
	<p>Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as iSqFt has no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how it will handle your information.</p>
	<p>Please note that iSqFt is only required to respond to one request per customer each year. iSqFt is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address: privacy@iSqFt.com.</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
	<p>At any time without prior notice, iSqFt may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in iSqFt's practices. When iSqFt posts changes to this Privacy Policy, iSqFt will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. iSqFt encourages you to bookmark this Privacy Policy and to periodically review it to inform yourself of changes to it or any of iSqFt's other policies. Any changes to iSqFt's Privacy Policy will become effective upon iSqFt's posting of the updated policy. Use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy then in effect.</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:22px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">Acceptance of Privacy Policy</p>
	<p>By using the Site, you accept this privacy statement. If you do not agree with this privacy statement, do not use the Site. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement from time to time. Your continued use of any portion of the Site, following notification or posting of such changes, will constitute your acceptance of those changes.</p>
