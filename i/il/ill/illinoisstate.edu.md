Illinois State University            Web Privacy Notice and Practices                             April 20, 2004
Illinois State University is committed to providing a safe and secure Web presence for the campus
community, prospective students and visitors. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information
collected online.
While visiting Illinois State University’s Web pages, there are three types of information that may be
collected: information voluntarily provided by you, cookies, and Web visitor logs.
          Information Voluntarily Provided by You
          While browsing the University’s Web presence, visitors may choose to provide information to
          help us serve their needs. Any collected data is used to fulfill the user’s request, and any
          personally identifiable information sent is used only for the purpose indicated. Once submitted,
          visitors can have their information removed by contacting the office where they sent the original
          request. Alternate methods are available via phone, paper and surface mail to request identical
          information or applications.
          Cookies
          Some University Web sites may use cookies, which are pieces of information stored by your Web
          browser. Cookies are used for two purposes,
               • to carry data about your current session at the site from one Web page to the next; and
               • to identify your previous session.
          Some pages may not function properly without cookies, therefore if you are concerned about
          cookies you may:
               • turn them off in your browser;
               • set your browser to ask you before accepting a new cookie; or
               • manually delete them from your browser after your visit.
          Web Visitor Logs
          When visiting the University’s Web presence, some servers may automatically collect non-
          personal information from your computer such as: the type of computer operating system, the
          browser in use, the browser’s capabilities, the domain name of the Internet service provider, etc.
          This information is used to refine the University’s Web presence and only reported in an
          aggregate form.
Additional and Alternate Privacy Notices
Units and departments within the University’s Web presence may have special reasons to collect specific
information from visitors. The owners of these sites have been asked to provide additional or alternative
privacy notices.
