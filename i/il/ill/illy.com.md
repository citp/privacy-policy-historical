## Our Privacy Policy

illy is committed to protecting your privacy. In order to provide you with the best information and services, and a more personalized browsing or shopping experience, we may collect information about your visit to our site.  This privacy policy explains our online information collection practices and how we use the information we collect.  The policy applies only to visitors and customers in the United States. 

**The Information We Collect  
** When you shop on our site, sign up for our mailing list or online newsletter or participate in an online forum, community or message board, we may collect certain personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and credit card information. 

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our site. Examples of this type of information include the domain name of your Internet service provider and the type of browser you are using. 

  
**How We Use Collected Information  
** Personally identifiable information you provide may be used to fulfill your shopping order, requests for information and services and to offer you products, services, contests, surveys and information we think may be of value to you. We may also, from time to time, extend selected offers or promotional information on behalf of one of our partners, but we do not sell, rent, share or give your personally identifiable information to third parties. When you place an order through our online store, request a catalog, sign up for our mailing list or online newsletter, enter a contest or sweepstakes or join an online community, forum or message board, we will automatically add you to our list to receive special offers by email and/or mail. 

Non-personally identifiable information we collect may be used in aggregate to optimize the design of our site, enhance the user experience and provide demographic information about our users. 

We reserve the right to disclose any information without notice or consent in response to a legal request, regulation or subpoena, or where we believe it is necessary to take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud or to protect the integrity of our site or the safety of our visitors.
