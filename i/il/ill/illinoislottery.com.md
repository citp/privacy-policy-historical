## I. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for visiting the Illinois Lottery’s website, which includes [www.illinoislottery.com](https://www.illinoislottery.com/),  [www.myillinoislottery.com](https://www.myillinoislottery.com/en-us/home.html), and [https://m.myillinoislottery.com](https://m.myillinoislottery.com/) (collectively, the "Lottery Websites") or the Illinois Lottery's ticket purchase mobile app ("Mobile App") for any purpose (the Mobile App and the Lottery Websites collectively, the "Websites" or the "Website"). The Website Providers (defined below) recognize that you need to understand how your privacy is protected when you visit this Website. As such, the Website Providers have established this Privacy Notice. For purposes of this Privacy Notice, the "Website Providers" means the Illinois Department of the Lottery, including its agents, contractors, and any parties involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Websites or providing information related to the Websites, including, but not limited to, Camelot Illinois LLC ("Camelot Illinois") and each of their respective successors and assigns.

This Privacy Notice is subject to change at any time without notice to you by posting changes on a Website. The Website Providers encourage you to review this Privacy Notice from time to time. Your continued use of any Website following any changes made to this Privacy Notice will mean that you accept the revised Privacy Notice.

This Privacy Notice describes the Illinois Lottery's privacy practices regarding information collected from you when you visit the Websites. This Privacy Notice describes what information is collected and how that information is used. Because this Privacy Notice only applies to the Websites, if you link to another entity’s website or mobile app through a Website, you should examine that entity’s privacy notice to determine its website practices (including other state agency websites).

For purposes of this Privacy Notice, "you" or "your" means each person, group of individuals, entity or entities who visits a Website for any purpose.

For purposes of this Privacy Notice, Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. PII includes, among other information, an individual's name, address, telephone number, date of birth, password information, and any other information used to identify you on this Website. A domain name or Internet protocol address is not considered PII. PII does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.

You must be 18 years or older to use the Websites. If you attempt to purchase Illinois Lottery game tickets for Lotto, Mega Millions®, Powerball®, or any other Illinois Lottery games authorized by law to be sold via the internet ("Internet Tickets") or a subscription for specific Illinois Lottery games ("Lottery Subscription") by visiting [www.illinoislottery.com](https://www.illinoislottery.com/),  [www.myillinoislottery.com](http://www.myillinoislottery.com/) or [www.m.myillinoislottery.com](http://m.myillinoislottery.com/), the Website Providers will collect information about your Internet protocol ("IP") address via geo-filtering software.

Once you provide PII, however, it becomes a public record that may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by state or federal laws.

Without limiting the foregoing, PII may be collected or disclosed without your consent, if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of the Illinois Lottery, or necessary for the Illinois Lottery to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation, including the Freedom of Information Act; (2) made pursuant to a court order, subpoena or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating your identity; (4) with affiliates of the Illinois Lottery, the Website Providers, or Third Party Service Providers to provide the services on the Websites; or (5) to federal or state law enforcement authorities to enforce the Illinois Lottery’s rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to the Illinois Lottery’s information technology assets or against other inappropriate use of the Websites.

## XII. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION

In the event of a data breach, the Website Providers and/or the Third Party Service Providers will notify all Players Account holders of the breach in the most expedient time possible, without unreasonable delay. The disclosure notification may be via mail, email or other expedient methods such as a newspaper publication. Such notification shall include, but is not limited to (i) the toll free numbers and addresses for consumer reporting agencies, (ii) the toll-free number, address, and website address for the Federal Trade Commission, and (iii) a statement that the individual can obtain information from these sources about fraud alerts and security freezes.
