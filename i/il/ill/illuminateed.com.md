# Privacy Policy - Illuminate Education

## **Illuminate Education, Inc.**

Revised July 21, 2017

### **I. Your Privacy Rights Are Important To Us**

The privacy of students, their parents and guardians, and visitors of this website is important to Illuminate Education, Inc. (“Illuminate”). This Privacy Policy is intended to answer your questions about the privacy practices applicable to our Website, [www.illuminateed.com](https://www.illuminateed/.com), as well as the data Illuminate maintains on behalf of teachers, administrators, school districts, counties, and other educational institutions (“Educational Organizations”) throughout the country.

Illuminate partners with Educational Organizations to provide tools to collect, organize, and analyze data about the students and education professionals in their school, charter management organization, county and/or district. Educational Organizations collect information about students and their guardians, teachers, and other individuals which is then stored and processed by Illuminate. In these situations, the Educational Organization rather than Illuminate decides the reasons information will be collected and processed. Illuminate’s privacy and data security practices regarding such information are governed by the contract entered into between Illuminate and the Education Organization and applicable law. For details regarding the information your Educational Organization collects, the use of such information, and any permissible disclosures to third-parties, please contact your Educational Organization directly. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies that Illuminate does not own or control, or individuals who Illuminate does not manage.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please [Contact Us](mailto:help@illuminateED.com).
