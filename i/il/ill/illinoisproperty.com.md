         cookies are called "session cookies." Session cookies are used only during a specific
         browsing session. We may use a session cookie, for example, to remember that you have
         already navigated through a particular menu, or that you have entered in age information

Who is collecting information?
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, only RE/MAX Northern Illinois and our service providers,
and our network of real estate brokers will have access to your personal account information.
When you are on our site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that
information with RE/MAX Northern Illinois, our service provider, and our network independently
owned offices and their sales associates. If personal data is to be collected and/or maintained
by any company other than RE/MAX Northern Illinois or its service providers or network
independently owned offices and their sales associates, we will try to notify you on the website
or in an updated version of this Privacy Policy. If you do not want your data to be shared, you
can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.
Other websites to which we link may collect personally identifiable information about you when
you visit those sites. The information practices of other websites linked to our websites are not
covered by this Privacy Policy.
With whom does RE/MAX Northern Illinois share my information?
We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your
permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law
requires it or under the circumstances described below. These are some of the ways that your
information may be disclosed.
Real Estate Transactions
We may share your information with Network Members in order to put you in contact with the
right office and real estate broker and for the promotional purposes of the Network Members.
We may share information from forms with 3rd parties who have sponsored the forms or parties
related to the transaction who are working with you or your real estate broker.
Service Providers
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including
packaging, delivering, or mailing, website development and operation, answering customer
questions about products or services, sending postal mail or email, analyzing website use,
processing payments, providing investor information and processing data. We will only provide
                                                   5
DB04/1001225.0002/10710912.1 DOC


those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are contractually
prohibited from using that information for any other reason.
Data in the Aggregate
We may disclose "blinded" aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other
third parties. Blinded data is data that does not identify an individual person.
Other
We also may disclose your information in special cases. For example, when we believe that we
must disclose information to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
violating our Terms and Conditions of Use, or may be causing injury to or interference with our
rights or property, other website users or customers, or anyone else who may be harmed by such
activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the
law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain,
service and improve our products and services.
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or assets. In such
transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business
assets. In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of RE/MAX Northern Illinois'
businesses, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets and may
be disclosed in connection with negotiations relating to a proposed transaction. In such case, the
transferred information may become subject to a different privacy policy.
How can I control my personal information?
If you have a concern about your personal information, please contact us at the email address
provided in this Privacy Policy. We will use good faith efforts to attempt to assist you. .
What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of my
information?
Your Company Account Information and Company Profile is password-protected so you have
access to this personal information. Remember to sign out of your Company account and close
your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot
access your account by using your computer when you are away from it. Because information
sent through the Internet travels from computer to computer throughout the world, when you
give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country
where you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Except as specifically stated, this site does not
use security encryption measures. Information that you disclose by use of this site (as with any
site that is non-secure), by posting a message or using email, potentially could be collected and
used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such
                                                  6
DB04/1001225.0002/10710912.1 DOC


information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive
to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we
receive your transmission, we use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our
systems. The My Property Finder and/or My REMAX sections of the Web-System are not secure.
Files uploaded may be accessed in a general library that is available on the Internet without
password security.
Choice/Opt-out
To ensure that you will not receive recurring marketing or other information from us unless you
choose to, we will provide you with simple instructions on each marketing email from RE/MAX
Northern Illinois for you to let us know that you have chosen to stop receiving such emails from
us.
What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose information online, that information
is accessible to other customers and users. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining
the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible
whenever you are online.
When you or we end your customer relationship with us, we will treat the information we have
about you as if you were still our customer.
