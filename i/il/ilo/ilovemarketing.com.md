PRIVACY POLICY

Because we value your patronage, we want to address any privacy concerns you may have. To that end, we have set forth our privacy policy for handling the information you share with us online. We want your decision to do business with us to be an informed one.

• Collecting Information

When you visit our Website, we may collect information about you that you voluntarily choose to share with us. This identification may include, but is not limited to, your name, your physical address, your e-mail address, your telephone number, details of your needs and preferences, and other details of your life.

When visiting our Website you may be directed, through hyperlinks, to other Websites that are beyond our control. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection of information by those other companies and Websites. Although we encourage third parties to provide their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their activities, such as how they handle the information they collect online.

• Using Information Collected

We primarily use the identification information you voluntarily share with us to customize your online experience and to do what you have asked of us. We also use your identification information to tell you about our products and services, but you may instruct us not to send communications to you by following the procedure indicated below under “Contacting us”. As for usage tracking data, we primarily use that information to operate and improve our Websites, and to further our marketing efforts.

As a general rule, we do not share you information with unaffiliated third parties. We may, however, share your information with our own personnel and our service providers to the extent necessary to fulfill your requests. We may also share your information with our affiliates, but we will not share it with unaffiliated third parties for direct marketing purposes. We reserve the right to disclose your information under limited circumstances, such as to cooperate with law enforcement or judicial authorities as required by law or legal process, to protect our own legal rights, or to protect the public good.

Whenever you are online, you run the risk that the information you give out will fall into the wrong hands. Although we implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide to us. We accept no responsibility or liability for the activities of third parties.

• Updating Information

If you would like to review the information about you that we have collected through our Websites, or to change that information, you can make that request by following the procedure indicated under “Contacting us”. We may require that you verify your identify before we process your request.

• Updating Our Privacy Policy

We may, from time to time, change our Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting our updated Privacy Policy on our Website and inserting a new “Effective Date”.
