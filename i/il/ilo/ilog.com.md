# Privacy policy

This document was last updated November 19, 2004. 

While you can travel through most of our website without giving us any information about yourself, it is sometimes necessary for us to request information so that we may provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains our data collection practices and use in those situations. Please read the complete ilog.com privacy statement. 

Collecting your Personal Information  
Generally, personal information is requested when you register for an event that appears on our website, submit a support request online, request information about our products, or request an evaluation copy of our products. Personal information collected by ilog.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

Use of your Personal Information  
We use your personal information for five primary purposes: 

  * In order to better respond to requests for service, quotes for products or evaluation downloads 
  * To address performance and fix issues 
  * To respond to general inquiries and requests for information 
  * To help you quickly find software, services or information on ilog.com 
  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you 



We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

ILOG will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process served on ILOG or its website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ILOG and its creditors (in the event of a dissolution proceeding), and, (c) address circumstances affecting the personal safety of users of ILOG, its websites, or the public. 

Control of your Personal Information  
When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, ilog.com will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited circumstances described above. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

ilog.com may send out periodic emails informing you of technical service issues related to a product or service you requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen. 

Access to your Personal Information  
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. By emailing us at [privacy@ilog.com](mailto:privacy@ilog.com) you may: 

  * View, edit and even remove personal information you have already given us 
  * Tell us whether you want ilog.com to send you marketing information 
  * Subscribe or cancel subscriptions to newsletters about our services and products
