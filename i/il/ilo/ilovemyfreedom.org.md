Last updated on June 20, 2019

We know that you care how your information is used, and we appreciate your trust that we will use it carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our Privacy Policy.

By visiting us, you are accepting the privacy policy described below.

 **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

Information you provide. We receive and store information you enter. For example, when you search for or buy a product or service, or when you supply information such as your address, phone number or credit card. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our website, and communicating with you. In addition, if you choose, we may share your information with other companies who provide goods or services that you are interested in. Please see the “opt-in/opt-out” section of this Policy.

Like many websites, we use “cookies”. Cookies are small programs that we transfer to your hard drive that allow us to recognize you and to provide you with a customized shopping experience. If you do not want us to use cookies, you can easily disable them by going to the toolbar of your web browser, and clicking on the “help” button. Follow the instructions that will prevent the browser from accepting cookies, or set the browser to inform you when you receive a new cookie. In addition, you may visit this and other websites anonymously through the use of utilities provided by other private companies.

Other information. Every computer has an ip (internet protocol) address. Ip addresses of computers used to visit this site are noted. In addition, we automatically collect other information such as email addresses, browser types, operating systems, and the url addresses of sites clicked to and from this site.

Information from other sources. We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. This may include updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

 **THIRD PARTY SITES**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.

Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party’s website and review its privacy policy.

The site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

 **HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**

Customized shopping. We use your information to better serve you by providing a customized shopping experience. As noted above, you may “opt-out” of this customization, or even visit and shop anonymously.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  
Special offers. We may send you special offers from time to time, unless you choose to “opt-out” of receiving such offers. In addition, we may also send you special offers from other companies. Again, you may “opt-out”. If we send you offers from other businesses, we do not share your personal information with them. The offers come directly through us. Please see the “opt-in/opt-out” selection at the end of this policy.  
Business transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that we are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.  
Law enforcement.

If we receive a lawful court order to release account or other personal information then we will comply with the law. We will also release information when necessary to protect the life, safety or property of others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk.

 **YOUR CHOICE: OPT-IN OR OPT-OUT.**

It is your choice whether to receive emails or special offers from us or others. The following section provides you with this choice. Please note the default settings.  
Please send me email or other mail informing me of special offers of your products or services.  
Please do not send me email or other mail informing me of special offers of your products or services.

We also use Google Analytics advertiser features to optimize our business. Advertiser features include:  
Remarketing with google analytics  
Google display network impression reporting  
Doubleclick platform integrations  
Google analytics demographics and interest reporting

By enabling these google analytics display features, we are required to notify our visitors by disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the google analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the doubleclick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather data about your activities on our site. Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our check-out form but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order. The “remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our site, and match the right audience with the right advertising message.

You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting google’s ad settings and/or you may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the network advertising initiative opt-out page
