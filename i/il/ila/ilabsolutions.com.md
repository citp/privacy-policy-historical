##  1\. NOTICE

**Scope of Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement covers the collection, treatment and use of any personal information gathered by Agilent from customers, suppliers, vendors and other entities that Agilent does business with (“Vendors”) and from job applicants.

Specifically, we use your personal information to respond to your correspondence, help you complete a transaction, provide updates on service and benefits, and personalize our websites and communications (including marketing communications) with you. 

Whenever we collect credit card numbers or other financial data, these are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.

From time to time in accordance with applicable law, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest.  To unsubscribe from promotional emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email or in Section 2 below (“Choice”).
