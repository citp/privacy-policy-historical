<p>We note that in several of our divisions, we process personal data as a data processor when providing the services. We process such data on our client instructions and in accordance with the terms of our services agreements and customer contracts.</p>
<h2>3. Marketing Communications</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable laws (including only with your consent where required by applicable laws), we will send you periodic marketing messages from Agilent, including newsletters, promotions and special offers. We will use your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, social media profile and email address to send these messages to you. You are able to opt out of receiving such messages without any negative effect to your relationship with Agilent by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. However, please note that opting out will prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or special offers. If you opt out of such marketing messages, we will continue to send you non-marketing emails, e.g. emails about our business dealings with you. We also reserve the right to contact you when we believe it necessary, including where required by law.</p>
<p>We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt out at any time of other contacts from Agilent and without any negative effect to your relationship with Agilent, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice will be offered at the bottom of our online or offline communications to you as well as on our web registration pages.</p>
<p>If you have any difficulty opting out, please use this unsubscribe <a href="http://www.agilent.com/cs/agilent/en-us/globaloptout/form">form</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Where We Store and Who We Share Your Personal Information With</h2>
<p>The personal information that we collect from you in relation to the provision of our Website will be transferred to, and processed in the USA by Agilent Technologies, Inc. so that we can perform our contractual obligations with you.</p>
<p>The personal information that we collect from you in relation to the selling of our products and services will be subject to the terms of the local Agilent subsidiary you contract with. Where the GDPR applies, such personal information will be transferred to, and processed in the USA by Agilent Technologies, Inc. under the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) (the “<strong>Model Clauses</strong>”), pursuant to Decision 2004/915/EC and 2010/87/EU. Please contact privacy_advocate@agilent.com, if you would like to see a copy of the Model Clauses.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Agilent’s global organizational structure also requires the global transfer of personal information within the Agilent group of companies. As a consequence, as it is in our legitimate interests for the efficient operation of a global company, and as permitted by applicable law, the personal information that you provide to us will be transferred across state or country borders, including to countries outside the country in which you reside (including to countries outside the EEA), to consolidate data storage, simplify information management or synchronize customer relationship activities globally. It will also be processed by staff operating outside the country in which you reside (including countries outside of the EEA) who work for us or one of our resellers, distributors, service providers or suppliers as noted below.</p>
