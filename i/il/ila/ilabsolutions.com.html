 1. NOTICE</h2>
 <p><strong>Scope of Privacy Statement</strong></p>
 <p>This Privacy Statement covers the collection, treatment and use of any personal information gathered by Agilent from customers, suppliers, vendors and other entities that Agilent does business with (“Vendors”) and from job applicants.</p>
 <p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications that you elect to access through our websites.</p>
 <p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Customers and Vendors</strong></p>
 <p>During the course of your relationship with us, we collect personal information to enable you to order or sell products or services, download software updates, make requests, register for customized communications programs and enhance your experience on our websites.</p>
 <p>We may collect such personal information as your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, contact and billing information, transaction history (including order, lead, demo and service/repair history) and credit card or other financial information (which shall be encrypted).</p>
 <p>Through your in-person communications and/or online interactions with Agilent, we may ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. We may combine the information you provide to us through different communications and contact channels, such as combining data collected online with information provided offline.</p>
 <p>In addition, personal information will be required to determine access eligibility for certain restricted parts of our website.</p>
 <p><strong>All visitors to Agilent websites</strong></p>
 <p>While you are visiting our website, we may collect some technical data related to your browsing session such as IP address, browser type and language, number of visits to our website and the hyperlinks you visited.</p>
 <p>In most cases, we use such technical data in aggregate form without identifying you personally for Agilent’s own reporting, statistics and website enhancements, as well as for information security purposes.</p>
 <p>Login or other tracking information that may identify you through website navigation will be stored for short time periods for technical security, website improvements, customer relationship purposes and so far as you continue interacting with Agilent.</p>
 <p><strong>How We Use The Information</strong></p>
 <p>Agilent uses your personal information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your personal information to respond to your correspondence, help you complete a transaction, provide updates on service and benefits, and personalize our websites and communications (including marketing communications) with you. </p>
 <p>Whenever we collect credit card numbers or other financial data, these are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.</p>
 <p>From time to time in accordance with applicable law, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. &nbsp;To unsubscribe from promotional emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email or in Section 2 below (“Choice”).</p>
 <p>Furthermore Agilent and its third-party service providers may use cookies (as described below) to provide a more relevant and personal online experience and to analyze and improve our services, which may include tracking traffic, usage and navigation patterns related to your activities on our websites.</p>
 <p>For more information about how you can express your choice regarding the use of your personal information, please read Section 2 below (“Choice”).
 </p>
 <h2>
 2. CHOICE</h2>
 <p>Agilent will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Privacy Statement above without first notifying you and offering a choice, or if required by applicable law, seeking your consent.</p>
 <p>To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we may send you periodic messages from Agilent, including newsletters, promotions and special offers. We will use your name and email address to send them to you. You may choose to opt out of receiving these messages without any negative effect to your relationship with Agilent by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. However, please note that opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or special offers. If you opt out we may continue to send you non-marketing emails, e.g. emails about our business dealings with you. We also reserve the right to contact you when we believe it necessary, including where required by law.</p>
 <p>We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt out at any time of other contacts from Agilent and without any negative effect to your relationship with Agilent, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice may be offered at the bottom of our online or offline communications to you as well as on our web registration pages.</p>
 <p>If you have any difficulty exercising your choices or feel that choices you made on particular websites have not been taken into account, please use this Unsubscribe form [<a href="http://www.agilent.com/cs/agilent/en-us/globaloptout/form">http://www.agilent.com/cs/agilent/en-us/globaloptout/form</a>].</p>
 <p>Except as provided in Section 3, “Onward Transfer”, your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your personal information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2>
 3. ONWARD TRANSFER</h2>
 <h3>

 <p>Agilent does not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Privacy Statement. </p>
 <p>We only share your personal information among Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries or with distributors or other resellers of Agilent products and services or service providers (e.g., a shipper, credit card processor, market research company, etc.) who are acting on our behalf for the purposes of fulfilling your order or responding to your inquiry. Such Agilent entities and business partners are required to keep this data confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Agilent.</p>

 <p>Agilent’s global organizational structure requires the global transfer of personal data within the Agilent group of companies. As a consequence and as permitted by applicable law, the personal information that you provide to us may be transferred across state or country borders, including to countries outside the country in which you reside (including to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")), to consolidate data storage, simplify information management or synchronize customer relationship activities globally. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the country in which you reside (including countries outside of the EEA) who work for us or one of our resellers, distributors, service providers or suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure it. We may store personal information in locations outside our direct control (e.g. on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
 <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share this password with anyone.</p>
