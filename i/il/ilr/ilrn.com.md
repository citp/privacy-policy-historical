# Privacy - Cengage

## Cengage is Committed to Respecting your Privacy

We have a Global Privacy Policy that protects all the Personal Information we receive from you as well as information we receive from schools and other third parties. It protects information collected online as well as offline.

If you are an educator, parent, or student, Cengage Learning is a service provider to your school or organization; please reach out to the appropriate contact at your school or organization with questions or inquiries. This notice does not cover other organizations' sites that may be accessible via links on our sites. These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them.

We also want our privacy practices to be very clear so you can interact with us in confidence. The statements and links below may answer your questions about how we handle your Personal Information.

## Additional Privacy Program Information

#### Privacy Statement for Hosted School Websites

Certain Cengage businesses, like Ed2Go, administer websites that provide course materials and services for educational institutions and companies. Information collected on these websites is only used by us to support our clients and provide the services requested by the course instructors. We do not use this information for our own purposes. Most educational institution student course records are also protected by the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). For information on your company or school's privacy policies, please contact the administration.

Our hosted websites may offer students and professionals the opportunity to interact directly with Cengage Learning.  If so, the [Cengage  Privacy Notice](http://www.cengage.com/privacy/statement) **** will apply to that information.

All Cengage workers are required to follow these established safeguards, which include the following:
