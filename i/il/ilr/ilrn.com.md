# Privacy – Cengage

### Privacy Statement Regarding K-12 Students and Children’s Data

Cengage is committed to protecting children’s privacy. This means:

  1. We do not allow any children under 16 to register with Cengage, and we do not knowingly collect or use any personal information pertaining to children under 16 for our own purposes. If you believe that an underage child has provided personal information to us, please contact privacy@cengage.com so that we may delete the information and take other appropriate steps.
  2. We provide products and solutions to educational institutions that require us to process K-12 student information. We only collect and process information pertaining to these children as a processor for the educational institutions. We do not use any of this student information for our own purposes. We comply with all applicable laws related to student data processing, including the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children’s Online Protection Act, and U.S. state student privacy laws.

### Important Information for EEA Residents

These provisions, together with the statements in the Cengage Privacy Notice, explain our practices with regard to EEA personal data.  
This information is being provided by Cengage, Inc. for itself and its subsidiaries:

##### 2\. The Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing, including Legitimate Interests

The Cengage Privacy Notice explains the reasons why we process your Personal Information. We only process Personal Information when we have a legal basis for the processing, such as:

  * To fulfill a contract with you or your school
  * For closely-related purposes, such as payment processing and financial account management, contract management, website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance
  * With your consent (or provided you have not objected, as may be appropriate under applicable law), such to provide you with marketing communications  



We may also process your Personal Information for the purposes of our legitimate interests (or for the legitimate interests of your school, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms.) In particular, we may process your Personal Information as needed to:

  * Protect you, us or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud) or cheating, 

  * Comply with the laws that are applicable to us around the world,
  * Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service, 
  * Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions, and  
  * Understand and improve our business or customer relationships generally. 



##### 3\. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

We may use profiling and analytics to understand how individuals interact with our educational materials, such as assess engagement and improve learning outcomes, and product development purposes. For example, we may use analytics to study the amount of time that individuals spend on specific content items and we may infer engagement from this process. These analytics also help us understand and improve our materials, as we can determine what materials are more or less accessible to students. We may also use analytics for course integrity purposes, such as to identify individuals that may be cheating.

We will not make automated decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless (1) the decision is necessary as part of a contract that we have with you, (2) we have your explicit consent, or (3) we are required by law to use the technology.

##### 4\. When You are Required to Provide Personal Information to Cengage

In most cases, you are not required by law to provide any Personal Information to Cengage. You are required to provide certain Personal Information to enable us to enter into a contract with you so that you can use our products and services. Our registration forms indicate which data elements are required for our contracts. If you do not provide these data elements, we cannot do business with you.

##### 5\. Your Rights

As noted in the [Cengage Privacy Notice](https://www.cengage.com/privacy/notice/), you always have the right to object to our marketing communications. To opt-out of emails, simply click the link labeled “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email we send you. To revoke permissions that you may have given to send text messages, text STOP in response to any message.    
Cengage also respects the rights of EEA residents to access, correct and request erasure or restriction of their personal information as required by law. This means: 

  * You generally have a right to know whether or not Cengage maintains your Personal Information. If we do have your personal information, we will provide you with a copy (subject to the rights of others). If your information is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to update it.  
  * You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information.
  * You may also ask us to delete or restrict your personal information. 



To exercise these rights, please contact us via email to privacy@cengage.com or write us at the address above, and a member of our Privacy Team will assist you.  Please understand that we may need to verify your identify before we can process your request.   

If you believe that we have processed your Personal Information in violation of applicable law, you may file a complaint with the Cengage Privacy Office or with a supervisory authority.

##### 6\. International Transfers

As noted in the [Cengage Privacy Notice](https://www.cengage.com/privacy/notice/), your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored at or processed in the United States and other countries which may not have equivalent privacy or data protection laws. 

We generally use approved Standard Contractual Clauses to assure that Personal Information is adequately protected when it is transferred out of the European Economic Area or Switzerland, but we may also make transfers to recipients with approved Binding Corporate Rules or to recipients in the United States who have certified to the EU-US and/or Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. 

Please contact us via email to [privacy@cengage.com](mailto:privacy@cengage.com) if you would like more information about cross-border transfers or to obtain a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

##### 7\. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as the information is needed for the purposes set forth in Section 3 above and for any additional period that may be required or permitted by law. You may request that we delete your Personal Information by contacting us via email to [privacy@cengage.com](mailto:privacy@cengage.com).

Our hosted websites may offer students and professionals the opportunity to interact directly with Cengage Learning.  If so, the [Cengage  Privacy Notice ](https://www.cengage.com/privacy/notice/)will apply to that information.
