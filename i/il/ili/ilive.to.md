**Advertisers**

iLive.to may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the iLive.to site, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. iLive.to does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks iLive.to to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.

Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytic companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here:

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to iLive.to, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, iLive.to makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
