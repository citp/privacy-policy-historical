### Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy as of August 2, 2007.

**iLike, Inc.’s Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy applies to iLike, Inc.’s websites, including iLike.com, GarageBand.com, GCast.com and i-cast.com websites (“Websites”). iLike, Inc. believes in the responsible use of personal information. We understand that without the trust and respect of the musicians and fans that make up our community we’d have nothing. So we’ll strive to honor the privacy of anyone who signs up as a member.

**Your Personal Information at iLike, Inc.’s Websites**  
iLike, Inc. is the sole owner of the personal information collected on its Websites and we collect personal information from our users at several different points on these Websites. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

iLike, Inc.’s Websites ask for personal information only when it’s necessary in order to deliver value-add service to you. We require certain pieces of information so we can provide you a personalized experience. For example, on iLike.com, the iLike Sidebar software collects your listening preferences in order to provide you personalized music recommendations, and to allow you to share musical tastes and find other users who have compatible tastes. We collect your zip-code or other location information in order to provide locally-targeted notifications of nearby concerts. Similarly, we need names of uploading users and musicians who may go on to become Evolved CD Artists and only require a mailing address when you earn a prize (so we know where to mail your prize to). At any point you can view and edit this personal information under the “MyHome” section of iLike.com, and the “My Garage” section of GarageBand.com. And while we may use this information for research and to improve the site and services we offer you, except as stated herein or as you specifically give us permission, we promise not to pass on personally identifiable information to third parties.

Here’s the information that we require for basic registration at iLike.com, GarageBand.com, Gcast.com and i-cast.com: 

  1. A Screenname is collected and made public on the site. (Your Screenname becomes your public display-name at our Websites. It need bear no relation to your actual name). The following information is collected at registration: 
  2. Your email address. 
  3. A password for your account. (We remind you not to reveal your password to anyone). 
  4. In addition, you are invited to "opt in" to receive a regular newsletter or occasional email from our Websites, and you are free to opt out from either of these services at any point in the future. 
  
_You have the option of providing more private information to personalize your experience:_
  5. Your gender and date of birth. (For our own demographic reports - so we can build a better site for our audience). 
  6. Your zip code (US residents only) so we can tailor content to your local area. 
  7. Your music preferences. The iLike.com service includes a software component known as the “iLike Sidebar” which enables you to share your musical tastes as you listen to music on your computer, in real-time, through your Public Profile on our Websites. This includes providing your music category preferences or other music preferences. Sharing this information enables us to tailor music content to your taste and enables us to match you with other users who have compatible tastes. If you choose to share this information, it may be made publicly available through your Public Profile or other portions of our Websites. In particular, if you choose to install the iLike Sidebar, please understand that it operates as follows: 
  8. The iLike Sidebar will be sending your music listening data (including a list of all songs and playlists in your music library on your computer) to the iLike.com servers. Select clips of songs from your library will be examined by iLike servers, matched with music discography metadata collected from friends and other iLike users, and on occasion made available for playback by other iLike users. This is designed to make sure the sample-clips of music that display on your profile are appropriately representing the music you listen to in your library, and to ensure broad availability of audio clips to enhance music discovery for all our users. You may choose to opt of this "clip-matching" process at any time by changing your iLike account settings.
  9. This data will be saved by iLike, Inc. in our databases. 
  10. However, by choosing to install the iLike Sidebar, your music listening data, songs, and playlists in your music library are reported publicly in a personally identifiable way, but within your control. Specifically, part of the functionality of the iLike.com website is that you may create a personal profile that publicly reflects your music listening habits as determined by the iLike Sidebar. Your music listening data is also used to generate music recommendations, as well as to calculate music-compatibility scores with other users on iLike. 
  11. The iLike Sidebar is designed to automatically self-update itself (without asking permission from you). 
  12. Additional privacy controls that (a) allow you to choose who may see your music preferences and (b) allow you to hide particular music or playlist data that you prefer not to share with anybody can be found at http://www.ilike.com/account/settings. 
  13. Your full name (optional), which can be used to personalize the email messages that are sent on your behalf when you invite friends to the service, and may also be used (at your option) by friends who are searching for your profile. However, your full name is not displayed within the website except to yourself when you are logged in. 



Lastly, in general on the Websites, you may provide information for your Public Profile to introduce yourself to other members of our Websites, including the information listed above, or other information, but are under no obligation to do so.

If you register your Band with the Websites, you may be required to provide us with your first and last names, plus the first and last names and gender of all band members. In addition you will need to provide a “biography” of your band. These names and bio will be made public on your band’s profile page, gender will remain private. In addition you may provide additional information about your band for public display on your Band Profile, but are under no obligation to do so.

The information that you provide for your Public Profile or for your Band Profile will be publicly displayed without restriction on our Websites. By providing such information for public display on iLike.com, GarageBand.com or Gcast.com you recognize that it may be considered public domain and as such may be viewed, copied, or re-distributed by anybody who visits our Website. This public information includes without limitation your music preferences and any other information you choose to make available such as your own name, others’ names, images, song names and biographical information. Nevertheless, you retain any trademark rights of your band/song names and any copyright of your music and lyrics. 

**Cookies**  
Be aware that our Websites use “cookies”. Cookies are small packets of information we place on your hard drive for tracking purposes - essentially a code number that we use to recognize you when you come back to the site. Only the information you volunteer, however, or the choices you make while visiting the site, can be stored in a cookie. A cookie cannot determine your email address, for example, unless you type it in. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer, and only the site that created the cookie can read it.

Our Websites also use permanent cookies that store an encrypted session id code. This means we are able to “recognize” you when you come to the site, without the need for you to log in. In particular, if you download and install the iLike Sidebar software, this software will utilize a permanent cookie so that your computer (and music listening habits) are recognized whenever you browse the iLike.com website.

If your browser is set to reject cookies, you will not be able to log in to the site and hold an account. This means you will not be able to review music, register a band, and so on. You will, however, be able to browse most of the site freely and listen to tracks.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for processing your order.

**Log Files**  
We log IP addresses to track which users have made what page requests, what browser that person was using, what their cookie was, and at what time the request was made. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This logging process does not store any personally identifiable information.

**BBS & Chat Rooms**  
As a service to our users, we offer bulletin board service (BBS) and chat room service (for example, GarageBand.com offers a BBS and chat rooms in the “Backstage” area). Only your screen name will be made available to other users of these services. However, you should be aware that any comments you contribute may become public immediately - credited to your screen name. Please think twice and use your discretion before you reveal personal information to other users.

**Emails**  
Except for administrative emails (like important changes to this privacy policy, for example) all other emails we send are under your control. You may register your wishes at the Account Settings section of iLike.com, the My Garage section of GarageBand.com or the subscription settings section of i-cast.com. We issue many types of email communication. The following is a non-comprehensive list: (1) we send a registration email when you first become a member (2) we send a regular opt-in newsletter (3) we provide an opt-in subscription to occasional emails for the announcement of new site features, special events, etc (4) we send invitations or “add friend requests” at the request of your friends who are users of our service; we may send one follow up email to such invitations if they do not generate a response the first time (5) we notify you of updates that have happened to your account, your profile page, or your band page (6) if you are in a band, we notify you of changes in your status within a contest, or reviews of your music (7) we may notify you when you receive messages from other members of the service (8) the i-cast.com service is explicitly an email-notification service that will send you email to notify you of updates to a podcast, blog, or other RSS feed that you are subscribed to. In addition to the controls described above, the i-cast.com service enables you to choose delivery options for email, such as daily-digest, or weekly-digest. In order to make it easier for you to invite friends to use our services, we enable an easy ”address book import” from other online services (such as Hotmail, etc) – this address-book import will only function if you provide a username/password for the other online service, and we use this information to import your address book, but we do not save it. Furthermore, any user who receives unwanted invitations from our iLike.com service is able to block future unsolicited invitations.

**Security Systems**  
This website takes reasonable precautions to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices and are regularly reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

**Sharing**  
We will share user profile and demographic information with our partners and advertisers, for purposes including, but not limited to, the delivery of targeted advertising. This information will not be linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We partner with third-party service providers such as CD Baby http://www.garageband.com/go/cdbaby which provides CD Store services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for CD Baby or other such service provider to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We may implement certain promotion(s) or feature(s) from time to time which require us to share your personally identifiable data with third parties. In these cases we will only share your personally identifiable data if you elect to use such promotion(s) or feature(s) and we will enter into agreements with such third parties which restrict their use of such personally identifiable data to purposes related to the delivery of such promotion(s) or feature(s). Though we make reasonable efforts to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us or one of our Websites. 

**Links**  
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, telephone number and shipping address). Contact information (including telephone number and address) will be used to notify the winners and award prizes and by giving us your phone number you acknowledge and agree that we may contact you by telephone in connection with such survey or contest . Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We sometimes partner with third parties to implement our surveys and contests. Personally identifiable information may be initially received by and passed on to iLike, Inc. by such third parties.

**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email invitation to visit the site, and may send one follow-up invitation to friends that did not respond. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending these emails. The friend may contact us at [privacy@iLike-inc.com](mailto:privacy@iLike-inc.com) to request the removal of this information from our database.

**Partner Sites**  
We have partnered with third parties to enable bands to sell their CDs at GarageBand.com and with other partners to provide our community with editorial content (pro advice, celebrity interviews, and so on). At times, while purchasing CDs or reading articles, you may be viewing pages hosted by one of these or other partners - although it may look as if you are still at one of our Websites. To tell where you are, simply check the address of the page in your browser’s address window.
