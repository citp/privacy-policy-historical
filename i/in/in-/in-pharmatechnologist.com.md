WILLIAM REED PRIVACY & COOKIES POLICY

 **Updated as at 1 July 2012**   

This website is made available to you by William Reed Business Media (“ **William Reed** ”, " **we** ", " **our** " or " **us** ") (the “ **Website** ”).  This privacy policy outlines how we may use your personal information and forms part of the **Terms of Use** of the Websites. 

“ **Personal information** ” refers to any information which refers to you personally such as your name, e-mail address and postal address.  Please read this privacy policy to understand how we use your personal information after it has been collected by us. 

This Privacy Policy may be updated from to time.  The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page so please visit this Privacy Policy regularly.

We may collect personal information from you when you do the following through our Websites:

  * order products and subscriptions from us;
  * register as a user on one or more of our Websites;
  * provide content through our online communities;
  * apply for jobs with us;
  * register to receive our newsletters; and
  * contact us with a question or complaint.



We also collect certain information automatically about visitors to our Websites, as described in the section headed “Cookies” below.

The personal information we may collect from you includes your:

  * name;
  * postal address;
  * phone number (land line, mobile and fax);
  * credit or debit card details; and
  * email address.



If you apply for a job with us through the Websites you also have the opportunity to upload your CV to us.

When you give us any personal information as indicated above, we use your personal information to:

  * enable you to use any services that we may from time to time provide through the Websites;
  * enable you to become a registered user on one or more of our Websites;
  * process your transaction or subscription and correspond with you accordingly;
  * provide you, in accordance with your communications preferences, with information about our products and services, our latest news or special offers which may be of interest to you;
  * track activity on our Websites for market research purposes so that we can improve the usefulness and content of the Websites but, in carrying out such activity, we use the personal information in aggregate and on an anonymous basis;
  * stop you posting or sending offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on our Websites or where you otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the Websites.  This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour; and
  * for Website administration (including enabling us to respond to any comments on the Websites or feedback you may give us).



We may share personal information collected via the Websites within our corporate group including William Reed Holdings Limited, William Reed Business Media Ltd, HIM Ltd, William Reed Business Media SAS and William Reed Business Media Inc. Otherwise, we will only disclose personal information to government bodies and law enforcement agencies, successors in title to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf. 

On the basis that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data across international boundaries. In particular, we will hold your personal information in the UK and France, and we may transfer it to the USA to a service provider who may host the Websites and store personal information on our behalf.

While some territories outside the European Economic Area may not have laws which provide the same level of protection for personal information as those inside the European Economic Area, we will ensure that your personal information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed by us.   

By browsing the Websites and submitting personal information to us, you acknowledge our processing of your personal information on this basis. 

When you view our Websites we may store information on the hard drive of your computer or on your mobile device in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a small text file).  Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, William Reed) are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, videos and website analytics services).  The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time.  Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your website browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.  Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed and can be used by websites to recognise your computer when you later re-open your browser and browse the internet again. 

We use cookies for several reasons. For example, cookies enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

The specific types of cookies served through the Websites, either by William Reed or third parties and the purposes they perform are described in the table below:
