# Privacy Policy · iNaturalist.org

## Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") of the California Academy of Sciences' iNaturalist.org website, iOS App, and Android App, and describes how iNaturalist.org ("iNaturalist," "We," "Us" or "Our") handles Personal Information (as defined below) that users ("You," "or "User") provide to Us, or that We collect from You through the use of Our Website, which is located at www.inaturalist.org ( the "Website"), iOS App, and Android App (the “App(s)”). 

###  Website and App Visitors 

iNaturalist.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. iNaturalist.org's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how iNaturalist.org's visitors use its Website and Apps. From time to time, iNaturalist.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website and Apps. 

### Personally-Identifying Information

"Personal Information" means information such as Your first/middle initial or name, last name, e-mail address, street address, mailing address if different, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, credit card information, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and any other information that would allow someone to identify You or contact You. 

iNaturalist.org does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

iNaturalist.org may collect Personal Information when You choose to interact with iNaturalist.org in ways that require iNaturalist.org to gather such information, such as if You register as an iNaturalist user, or provide content to iNaturalist through Your computer or phone. The amount and type of information that iNaturalist.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, iNaturalist.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of Your interaction with iNaturalist.org. iNaturalist.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that doing so may prevent You from engaging in certain Website and App-related activities. 

iNaturalist.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its programmers, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on iNaturalist.org's behalf or to provide services available at iNaturalist.org's Website and Apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of Your home country; by using iNaturalist.org's Website or Apps, You consent to the transfer of such information to them. iNaturalist.org will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. 

Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, iNaturalist.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when iNaturalist.org believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of iNaturalist.org, third parties, or the public at large. Unless authorized by You through Your opt-in, or as provided above, We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances: 

  * If We are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); 

  * If We believe Your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy or any applicable Website and App(s) terms of use, or if You threaten the rights, property or safety of Us, Our Website, Our Apps, any other users or third party; 

  * If, in Our sole discretion, We believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect Our assets, to defend Our interests or comply with Our legal and regulatory obligations; or 

  * If there is a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving iNaturalist or the Academy. 




If you are a registered user of iNaturalist.org and have supplied your email address, iNaturalist.org may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with iNaturalist.org and our products. We primarily use blogs and groups to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. iNaturalist.org takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. 

#### Children

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children or knowingly allow children to purchase goods or memberships through Our Website and Apps. Visitors 12 years of age and younger must obtain an adult's permission before submitting any personal information to this or any other website or App. In the event that We learn that We have received any personal information from a visitor 12 years of age or younger, and We do not receive parental permission within a reasonable period of time of Our request for it, We will delete that information as quickly as possible. If You believe that We might have information from or about a child 12 years of age or younger, please contact Us at help@inaturalist.org. 

#### Unaffiliated Third Parties

Unless authorized by You through Your opt-in, or as provided above, We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances: 

  * If We are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); 

  * If We believe Your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy or any applicable Website and App terms of use, or if You threaten the rights, property or safety of Us, Our Website, Our Apps, any other users or third party; 

  * If, in Our sole discretion, We believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect Our assets, to defend Our interests or comply with Our legal and regulatory obligations; or 

  * If there is a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving iNaturalist or the Academy.
