## 4\. Transmission, storage and security of your personal information

**Recipients**

4.1. In order to fulfil your requests, we may need to share or otherwise transfer your personal information within the INGENICO group such as to the INGENICO Sales, Communication or Marketing teams based in your country or relevant for your industry sector. Where appropriate we may also transfer your personal information to third parties, for example external event organizers or partner companies who may be in a better position to satisfy your request.

4.2. We may also share your personal information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We contractually require these service providers to use or disclose the personal information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf.

**Security over the internet  **

4.3. No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion.  However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.

4.4. All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of.  We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

**Export outside the EEA  **

4.5. Your personal information may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the country in which you are located, whose data protection laws may be of a lower standard than those in your country.  We will, in all circumstances, safeguard personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.  

4.6. Where we transfer personal information from inside the European Economic Area (the EEA) to outside the EEA, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant personal information.  Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals (see the full list here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm), we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.

4.7. Please [contact us](mailto:contact.dataprotection@ingenico.com?subject=Ingenico%20Privacy%20Policy) if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information. 

**Data retention**

4.8. Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain the information you provided to us as long as necessary to provide you with the services you requested through our Website and until the time limit for claims which may arise from those services has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. So if we use your personal information for more than one purpose we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires; but we will stop using it for the purpose(s) with a shorter period once that period expires.

4.9. When personal data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information) or securely destroy the data. 

## 5\. Your rights & contacting us
