**How we use your information and who we share it with**

**Keeping you informed**

You do not have to give us any personal information in order to use many of the pages of this website.  However, any information which you choose to give us through this website may be added to our marketing database and may be used by us for marketing our services and our events. 

It is possible that our marketing materials may contain input from other companies or organisations we are dealing with, but we DO NOT sell or give your details to any other companies for them to try to sell you their products or services. 

**Law enforcement & crime prevention**

We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website users or relating to our website users.  We will have no legal liability for disclosing information in these circumstances. 

**Other sharing of information**

We may share personal information about you with:

  * our agents, service providers and data processors who provide a service to us and you; and 
  * any person or business (and their advisers) who might take over our rights or responsibilities under our agreement with you to allow them to prepare for taking these over (after that, we may also allow that person or business to use and share your information on the same basis as us.) 



We will not pass your information to anyone outside ING Direct N.V. other than for the purposes described above, unless:

  * we have your permission; 
  * we have to do so or are allowed to do so by law; 
  * we have a duty to the public to reveal the information; or 
  * our interests mean we must give the information - for example, to prevent fraud (we will not use this as a reason for giving information about you to anyone else for marketing purposes).
