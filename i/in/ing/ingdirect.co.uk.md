# ING Direct > Privacy Policy

**The information padlock signpost**  
The padlock symbol you see above is used on our site to alert users to the fact that their information will be collected at any given point. This privacy policy outlines the ways in which that data may be collected and used.

**A Word About Your Privacy**  
We respect your privacy. Not only do we respect it, but we also protect it. When you register to use the password protected areas of the site we will ask you for personal information about yourself. This information is only provided to those to whom you have authorised us to release information, or as required by legislation. This would include the financial institutions you've asked us to deal with, and specialised service providers (like the people who print our account statements). All of the above must meet our rigorous privacy standards. This policy does have a legal tone that reflects both the importance of the issue and it is consistent with recent Data Protection legislation. If you want more information regarding our privacy principles, please read on. If you have privacy questions or concerns, please contact Customer Services on 0845 603 8888.

**The Data Protection Act 1998**  
The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means that you're entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then decide whether you want to give us that information. To provide the highest level of customer service we need accurate customer information. You can help by informing us whenever your circumstances change. You also have the right to request a copy of information that we hold about you in our records. Any request to obtain a copy of this information must be made in writing to the Data Protection Officer, ING Direct, 410 Thames Valley Park Drive, Reading, Berkshire RG6 1RH.

**Cookies**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of data placed on your computer by a web server when visiting certain web sites. This data usually contains encoded information that informs the web server how and when you have used their site.

The type of cookie the ING Direct secure banking site uses is stored in temporary memory and will disappear after you leave the ING Direct website. These cookies enable you to move back and forth within a secure banking session. ING Direct does not and will not use cookies to retrieve data from your hard drive or to obtain your email address or other personal information.

From time to time, we may use cookies, for example when we conduct online surveys to help improve our website, or for specials promotions including microsites. These cookies do not store personal information such as names, email addresses or phone numbers.

**To change your browser settings:**  
Netscape Communicator or Navigator: Choose Preferences from the Edit menu. From the Preferences menu, select Advanced, and several cookie options will be listed in the lower right of the menu. There will be options that allow you to accept cookies, request permission before accepting or disallow cookies completely.

Microsoft Internet Explorer: Choose Internet Options from the Tool menu. Choose the Privacy tab and move the slider to accept "Cookies", usually the Medium setting. You will have several options - accept cookies, ask permission before accepting cookies or disallow cookies.

**Spotlight Tags**  
In order to improve our website and understand how it, and links to it, are used, we are working with third parties to track usage on our website. These third parties use pixel tags, also known as beacons or spotlight tags, to improve our understanding of web traffic, visitor behaviour and response to promotional campaigns. Pixel tags can be disabled by modifying the settings on your browser. For more information please contact your internet provider.

The third party advertising technology that we employ to serve adverts uses a separate persistent cookie, in conjunction with the pixel tags that we place on our site. We transmit non-personal information about your visit to the servers of this advertising technology company, for the purpose of targeting our Internet advertisements on other sites. By clicking [here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/), you can obtain an "opt out" cookie that will prevent your non-personal information from being used to target adverts. 

Changes to our privacy policy  
This privacy policy may be modified from time to time. Any changes to our privacy policy will be indicated on this page so you may want to check back here periodically.
