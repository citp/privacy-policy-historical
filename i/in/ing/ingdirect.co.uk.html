<strong>Where we  obtain your information from</strong><p></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Information provided  by you</strong><br>
The information we collect via this website may include  any personal details you type in and submit (such as your name, address, e-mail  address, etc.) and the contents of any correspondence you send to us.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>IP addresses</strong><br>
The information we collect via this website may also  include your IP address (this is your computer’s individual identification  number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet) which  is automatically logged by our web-server in the UK.&nbsp;  Unless we suspect fraud, we do not use your IP address to identify you  personally.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; spotlight  tags</strong><br>
  <br>
  This website also collects data which allows us to  recognise you, your preferences and how you use this website.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>This information is collected by using temporary ‘<em>session cookies</em>’.&nbsp; These are small strings of data stored in your  device’s temporary memory when you navigate around the website but which are deleted  when you close your Web browser.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>This information is also collected by using <em>spotlight tags</em> (also known as ‘boom  tags’, ‘clear GIFs’, ‘pixel tags’, ‘web beacons’ and ‘web bugs’).&nbsp; These are small strings of computer code that  are placed in the pages of our website which allow our advertising agents to  store ‘<em>persistent cookies</em>’ in your  Web browser’s cookie file when you access our website.&nbsp; Unlike session cookies, these persistent  cookies are not deleted when you close your Web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the ‘session’ cookies employed in this website to enable  you to move back and forth within a secure banking session and to save you  re-entering information.</p>
<p>Our session cookies and our advertising agents’ persistent  cookies do not store your e-mail address or other personal information.</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p><strong>How we use  your information and who we share it with</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Keeping you  informed</strong><br>
  You do not have to give us any personal information in  order to use many of the pages of this website.&nbsp;  However, any information which you choose to give us through this  website may be added to our marketing database and may be used by us for  marketing our services and our events.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is possible that our marketing materials may contain  input from other companies or organisations we are dealing with, but we DO NOT  sell or give your details to any other companies for them to try to sell you  their products or services. </p>
<p><strong>Targeting our  advertising</strong><br>
Our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in  combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used to  target our Internet advertisements which appear on other websites.&nbsp; This means that the adverts will be selected  based on the information we hold about you. &nbsp;This allows us to improve the effectiveness of  our advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical  analysis</strong><br>
  <br>
  The IP addresses (please see above for details) logged by  our web-server and our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in  combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used by us:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to perform technical diagnosis of our website’s performance  on a statistical basis;</li>
  <li>to analyse traffic data (so as to gauge interest in our  website and to improve our understanding of our websites visitors’ behaviour  and their response to our promotional campaigns); and</li>
  <li>to identify unusual transactions (in order to identify the  source of fraudulent actions.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Law  enforcement &amp; crime prevention</strong><br>
We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement  officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website  users or relating to our website users.&nbsp;  We will have no legal liability for disclosing information in these  circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other sharing  of information</strong><br>
  <br>
  We may share personal information about you with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>our agents, service providers and data processors who  provide a service to us and you; and</li>
  <li>any person or business (and their advisers) who might take  over our rights or responsibilities under our agreement with you to allow them  to prepare for taking these over (after that, we may also allow that person or  business to use and share your information on the same basis as us.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not pass your information to anyone outside ING Direct N.V. other than for the purposes described  above, unless:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we have your permission;</li>
  <li>we have to do so or are allowed to do so by law;</li>
  <li>we have a duty to the public to reveal the information; or</li>
  <li>our interests mean we must give the information - for  example, to prevent fraud (we will not use this as a reason for giving  information about you to anyone else for marketing purposes).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other websites</strong><br>
This privacy policy is only intended to cover personal  data collected through this website.&nbsp;  While we carefully select the websites which we link to, we are not  responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of these websites.</p></blockquote>
