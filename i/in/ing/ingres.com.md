We do link the information we store in cookies to personal information you submit while on our site.

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication and to analyze traffic patterns on our site. This can enable us over time to provide a better experience on our site by improving content or personalization and making our site easier to use.

Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to provide service and support, to improve the capabilities of our products and services, to update you on services and benefits, to personalize promotional offers and to personalize some Actian websites.

Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention.

Personal data collected online may also be combined with information you provide Actian through other sources such as product registration, call centers or public events such as trade shows or seminars.

Personal data given to Actian may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management.

Non-personal data is aggregated for reporting about Actian website usability, performance and effectiveness. It is used to improve the customer experience, usability and site content.

Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will communicate with you to provide the services you request, and we will use the information to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone in accordance with your wishes.

**7\. Who we share your information with**

Actian shares customer information across Actian-owned business entities and companies working on our behalf, but only as described above in “How we use your information.” For instance, if you download an evaluation product, we may share your information with an authorized Actian reseller in your territory.  We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

Actian contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers such as credit card processing companies, marketing campaign management companies, SaaS software providers,  email service providers or third party customer service companies to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions described in “How we use your information.”  Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Actian and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Actian. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers. Actian will not share personal information with any other third parties without your permission, unless required by law enforcement action, subpoena, or local law, or in our sole discretion, to law enforcement agencies to assist in any investigation, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or unlawful conduct or respond to a government request.

Certain Actian services are linked with those from unrelated third-party companies, some of which offer you the option to share with both Actian and the third party personal data you provide. Examples include the ability to register software products from multiple vendors from a single Actian Web page, to request communications from Actian marketing or solution partners, or to enable order completion through a reseller.

Actian or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets could be acquired, including some or all of your personal information. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

**8\. Your choices**

Actian will deliver a variety of information that complements our products and services. Actian-wide communications may include new product information, special offers, or an invitation to participate in market research. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. To be removed from our list, email us at [privacy@actian.com](mailto:privacy@actian.com).

Actian strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change or delete inaccuracies or modify your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.

**10\. Keeping your information secure**

Actian is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, Actian has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at privacy@actian.com.

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes.
