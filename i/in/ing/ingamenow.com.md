# Privacy

InGameNow is a social media network for sports fans. The site lets people remain current with their favorite leagues, teams, and athletes utilizing relevant sports content submitted by other community members and other sources. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles, which display some personal information to other members and visitors. This allows our users to identify each other and expand their personal network of contacts. InGameNow members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them via the website, SMS, WAP and Instant Messaging ("Service").

InGameNow cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at info@ingamenow.com.

User Profile information including members' pictures, user names, and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the InGameNow social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join InGameNow, to add users to members' contacts networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on InGameNow with each other through the InGameNow service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter, or news regarding the service, though users may choose not to receive email of this type. From time to time, InGameNow, or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on InGameNow. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members InGameNow members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system.
