# Privacy Policy Details | Ingram Content Group

We use cookies so you get the best experience on our website. By using our site, you are agreeing to our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20151013213951/http://www.dev.ingramcontent.com/pages/privacy-policy.aspx).[Accept & Close]()

### **PRIVACY POLICY**

_Last Updated July 29, 2016_

The name, address, e-mail, and any payment information provided by you to Ingram Book Group Inc. or its affiliated or subsidiary companies (collectively "Ingram") or through this website (“Site”), together with information regarding the manner of use via this Site, will be processed and/ or disclosed by us to third parties as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as reasonably permitted by law or regulation.

Our registration and user forms require users to provide us with information, including your name and e-mail address. The forms allow you to request additional information or order our Products or additional material as may be available from Ingram. This information falls into two categories: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) (collectively “Information”). PII includes information that identifies you specifically, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, other contact information, employer, business name, social security number and credit card numbers. Personally Identifiable Information also includes any information you provide us or we collect that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Non-PII is anonymous data that does not identify you specifically, such as aggregate data about the number of people who have accessed a particular Product. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose Non-PII for any purpose or provide to third parties. You can choose not to provide PII we may request of you, but, in general, most of the PII we request is required in order to provide our services and the lack of such PII will prevent us from doing so.

When you browse any Ingram website, you do not do so anonymously. Other information to be collected and logged includes: browser type, browser language, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain, date and time of your request, and the device you are using. This aggregate information is used to properly administer our products, make updates to our website, and analyze how our site is being used. 

**Ingram’s Use Of Your Information**   
Ingram uses your Information by itself or in conjunction with data collected through other sources to meet our contractual commitments to you, to provide the products or services to you, to respond to your requests, to properly administer and maintain the products, to customize content supplied to you, to provide you with information related to the products, to update the website and analyze how it is used, to offer you the product, to improve the products, to prevent fraud, violation of intellectual property rights and unauthorized use of products or your account, to track your purchase history, to conduct research, to contact you, to inform you about certain changes to our products, to develop new products, or as otherwise appropriate to the business needs of Ingram related to the products. If you no longer use the products, Ingram may retain any information that you have provided and may continue to use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**Third Party use of Personally Identifiable Information**   
Additionally, by agreeing to this Privacy Policy and continuing to use this Site, you agree Ingram may share Personally Identifiable Information with our affiliated companies and other third parties, limited to providing you information about our services, offers, or to assist with the services we provide to you, and only to the extent necessary. 

**Marketing**   
Ingram may provide additional information to you via e-mail, including service messages with important information about your account, informative newsletters, special promotions, and other announcements.  You will have the option to manage your subscriptions to these communications or unsubscribe from receiving e-mail messages.

**Content Owners**   
Ingram may share information about you and your use of the products with content owners or licensees that have rights related to the products that you access (“Content Owners”). Content Owners will use this information for their own research and tracking purposes, to evaluate product use and access, to improve products and related analysis. Ingram will not reveal your PII to Content Owners, just anonymous product usage data that does not identify you specifically.

**Other Use**   
Ingram reserves the right to disclose information if we reasonably believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Ingram, its users, the Content Owners or the public as required or permitted by law.

**Children's Privacy**   
You must be 18 years of age or older to create an account on this website. Ingram does not knowingly solicit orders or collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of eighteen. If we have reason to believe that any personally identifying information has been submitted to us by a child under eighteen, contact us and we will delete that information as soon as possible.
