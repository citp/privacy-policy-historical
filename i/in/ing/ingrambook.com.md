This Privacy Policy explains the policy of Ingram Customer System Inc. ("INGRAM") regarding the privacy of information supplied by USERS of ingrambook.com (the "SITE") or collected by INGRAM from SITE USERS. INGRAM intends to build USER trust and confidence in the SITE and is committed to protecting USER privacy.

**User Information**  
The SITE server automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which a visitor is accessing the SITE. INGRAM may log a USER's IP address for system administration and troubleshooting purposes. (A USER's IP address indicates the location of the USER's computer on the Internet.)

Other than disclosing the information described within this privacy policy, INGRAM does not disclose a USER's specific information to third parties. INGRAM does, however, identify a USER in connection with its use of certain aspects of the SITE. For example, INGRAM may identify a USER with any e-mail message that a USER sends through the SITE.

**Marketing  
** We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes page visits, paths, and purchases. By supplementing our records, this information helps us better serve our customers. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers, and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this Web site analysis tool by [clicking here](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7#optout). INGRAM does not sell or rent any USER's personal and confidential business information to any third party.

Ingram provides a wealth of information for our customer and publisher partners via e-mail, including service messages with important information about your account, informative newsletters, timely title alerts, special promotions, and other announcements that will keep you informed of the latest product and company news.  You will have the option to manage your subscriptions to these communications or unsubscribe from receiving e-mail messages.  Please note that Ingram does not sell or rent our e-mail lists to third parties.

**Cookies  
** The SITE employs "cookies" to speed navigation of the Web site, recognize each USER and his or her access privileges, and track a USER's site usage. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by a USER's Internet browser on a USER's computer's hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. A USER can set his or her browser to refuse cookies, but the USER will not be able to use the SITE. The SITE's cookies do not have the capability of infiltrating a USER's hard drive and gathering a USER's personal and confidential business information.

**Ingram cannot guarantee complete security, as it does not exist on the Internet.**

**Updates to This Policy  
** If INGRAM decides to change or update this Privacy Policy, it will post those changes and updates on this page so that the USER is always aware of what information INGRAM collects, how it uses that information, and under what circumstances INGRAM discloses it. INGRAM encourages each USER to review this Privacy Policy from time to time so USERS will know if the Privacy Policy has been updated or amended. If you have any questions about the SITE's Privacy Policy, please contact INGRAM at [ics-techsupport@ingrambook.com](mailto:ics-techsupport@ingrambook.com).
