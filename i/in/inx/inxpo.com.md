# INXPO Privacy Policy

                                    INXPO Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how INXPO, Inc. (either “INXPO,” “we,” or
“us”) treats personal information when you, the user, access the INXPO website
(“INXPO Website” or “Website”). This Privacy Policy only applies to information
collected by INXPO, and does not apply to any information collected by any third party.
By visiting the INXPO Website you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as they
may be amended from time to time.
The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed
on a set of data protection principles (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S.
Companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection
be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. INXPO
adheres to Safe Harbor Principles and applies those principles to any transfer of
information between the European Union countries and INXPO.
A. Cookies Policy
1. What is a Cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique
identifier that is placed on your computer or on your mobile phone (collectively referred to
herein as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard
drive. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies are held temporarily and disappear when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits. Cookies are widely
used to provide certain features of website, to make websites perform more efficiently, and
to provide information to the owners of the website. Each INXPO event and/or webcast
can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. INXPO
does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you.
2. What is a Local Shared Object (Flash Cookie)? INXPO uses both the Adobe Flash
Player and Silverlight players to deliver its video content services. To improve user
experience, Local Shared Objects (otherwise known as Flash or Silverlight Cookies or
LSOs) are used to provide features such as auto-resume and for saving your preferences.
Flash and Silverlight Cookies are stored on a user's terminal much the same as cookies
are, however it is not possible to manage them at browser level in the same way.
3. How to Disable Flash Cookies. The Adobe website provides comprehensive
information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies either for a specific domain like
bbc.co.uk or for all websites. See http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security

the features available to you for Flash-based applications on the Website and within
INXPO events and presentations.
4. How to Disable Silverlight Cookies. The Microsoft Silverlight website provides
directions       on      how       to    remove        Silverlight    cookies.          See
