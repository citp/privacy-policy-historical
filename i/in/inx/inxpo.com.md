                                       INXPO Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how INXPO, Inc. (either “INXPO,” “we,” or “us”) treats personal
information when you, the user, access the INXPO platform, mobile application or website (“INXPO

of this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time.
A. Cookies Policy
1. What is a Cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is
placed on your computer or on your mobile phone (collectively referred to herein as a "device") browser
from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. There are two different types of
cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are held temporarily and disappear when
you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits. Cookies are
widely used to provide certain features of website, to make websites perform more efficiently, and to
provide information to the owners of the website. Each INXPO event and/or webcast can send its own
cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. INXPO does not use cookies to collect
personally identifiable information about you.
2. What is a Local Shared Object (Flash Cookie)? INXPO uses both the Adobe Flash Player and Silverlight
players to deliver its video content services. To improve user experience, Local Shared Objects (otherwise
known as Flash or Silverlight Cookies or LSOs) are used to provide features such as auto-resume and for
saving your preferences. Flash and Silverlight Cookies are stored on a user's terminal much the same as
cookies are, however it is not possible to manage them at browser level in the same way.
3. How to Disable Flash Cookies. The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to delete
or disable Flash cookies either for a specific domain like bbc.co.uk or for all websites. See
http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security for more information. Please be aware that
restricting the use of Flash cookies may affect the features available to you for Flash-based applications on
the Website and within INXPO events and presentations.
4. How to Disable Silverlight Cookies. The Microsoft Silverlight website provides directions on how to
remove Silverlight cookies. See http://www.ehow.com/how_5972751_remove-silverlight-cookies.html for
more information. Please be aware that restricting the use of Silverlight cookies may affect the features
available to you for Silverlight-based applications on the Website and within INXPO events and
presentations.

online preferences and allow us to present content to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set
