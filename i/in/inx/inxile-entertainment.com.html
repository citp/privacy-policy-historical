<h2>5. Cookies</h2>
<p>5.1 Like most major websites, our Website uses cookies to maintain your logged in status. We do not use cookies to collect or store personal information about you or to gather analytics such as in the use of tracking purposes.</p>
<p>5.2 Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.

<h2>6. Safeguarding your personally identifiable information</h2>
<p>6.1 We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent we believe it reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and will protect it using the same level of safeguards we use to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of our own equivalent proprietary information. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer any personally identifiable information in accordance with this policy will agree to provide sufficient protection. We may store or transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area for the purposes stated in this policy.</p>

Should we discover a material data breach that may compromise your personally identifiable information, we will inform you as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>6.3 The database used to store your personal information is separated from the webserver and is firewalled to ensure maximum security and privacy. The Website has been designed to minimize the use and storage of personal information in cookies.</p>
<p>6.4 Your password is recorded as a cryptographic hash digest. We are unable to know what your password is nor are we able to send you your password if you should forget it. The Website makes available to you the ability to change your password at any time. It is your responsibility to protect your password and use a long and secure password. As we have no size or character limit on your password, we suggest using a long (12 or more characters) and randomly generated password. We highly encourage the use of a password manager, such as LastPass or 1Password, to generate and manage a highly secure and randomly generated password for use with the Website.</p>
<p>6.5 The Website uses an SSL secure connetion via HTTPS for any sensitive resources.</p>
