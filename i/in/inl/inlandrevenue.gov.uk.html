  <h2>General</h2>
  <p> Our Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding 
    the collection, use and disclosure of information that you may provide via 
    the HMRC website. Whenever you use this site, you consent to the collection, 
    use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h2> Ways that we collect information</h2>
  <p> Some areas of the site require you to actively submit information in order 
    for you to benefit from specific features (such as our range of online services). 
    You will be informed at each information collection point what information 
    is required and what information is optional. </p>
  <p>Some of this information may be personal (information that can be uniquely 
    identified with you, such as your full name, address, email address, phone 
    number etc.).</p>
  <p>We only collect such information when you choose to supply it to us.</p>
  <p>Information is also gathered without you actively providing it, through the 
    use of various technologies and methods such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 
    and cookies. These methods do not collect or store personal information.</p>
  <p>An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service 
    Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet. It is generally considered 
    to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP 
    address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather 
    than static (unique to a particular user's computer).</p>
  <p>We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate 
    information, and determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting 
    to our site, and to administer and improve the site.</p>
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored locally on your computer and contains 
    information about your activities on the Internet. On our website, we use 
    cookies to track users' progress through the site, allowing us to make improvements 
    based on usage data. The information in a cookie does not contain any personally 
    identifiable information you submit to our site.</p>
  <p>Once you close your browser, our access to the cookie terminates. You have 
    the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically 
    accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline 
    cookies if you prefer. If you choose not to accept the cookie, this will not 
    affect your access to the majority of information available on our website. 
    However, you will not be able to make full use of our online services.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.iab.net/standards/privacy.asp" target="_blank" title=" this link will open a page in a new browser window on a non-UK Government website">Internet 
    Advertising Bureau</a> (IAB) (this link will open a new window) provides in 
    depth information about cookies. </p>
  <h2>Page tagging</h2>
  <p>Sometimes we tag pages on the site when we are promoting various campaigns. 
    These tags are provided by our ad management partners, DoubleClick and Atlas. 
    These tags enable DoubleClick and Atlas to recognise a unique cookie on your 
    browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users 
    to our web site. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who 
    works with DoubleClick and Atlas. With this technology, the information that 
    we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does 
    not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. There 
    is more information about DoubleClick and Atlas - including information about 
    how to opt out of these technologies - on their websites.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Privacy information about <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy" target="_blank" title=" this link will open a page in a new browser window on a non-UK Government website">DoubleClick</a> 
      (this link will open a new window) </li>
    <li> Privacy information about <a href="http://www.atdmt.com/privacy/general" target="_blank" title=" this link will open a page in a new browser window on a non-UK Government website">Atlas</a>

  </ul>
  <h2> Monitoring of e-mail</h2>
  <p> We may monitor e-mail communications with HMRC (this includes any HMRC member 
    of staff). Any such monitoring will take place in accordance with the law.</p>
  <h2> Web Statistics</h2>
  <p> We use log files generated by our web servers to analyse site usage and 
    statistics but the files do not identify any personal information. Log file 
    analysis helps us to understand usage patterns on our website and to make 
    improvements to our service.</p>
  <h2> Disclosure</h2>
  <p> Except as otherwise stated, we may use information you provide via this 
    site to improve the content, to customise the site to your preferences, to 
    communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for internal marketing 
    and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>We do not disclose any information you provide via the site to any third 
    parties or other government departments except where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Such disclosures are necessary to fulfil our service obligations to you 
      in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in 
      accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li> Required by applicable laws, courts orders, or government regulations 
      (for example to prevent or detect crime).</li>
    <li> You give us permission to do so.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Access to and correction of personal information</h2>
  <p> We will take all reasonable steps in accordance with our legal obligations 
    to update or correct personally identifiable information in our possession 
    that you submit via this site.</p>
  <p>You have a right to ask to see details of any personal information that we 
    hold about you. If you wish to do so please contact our Data Protection Officer 
    at Room BP4302, Benton Park View, Longbenton, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE98 1ZZ</p>
  <h2> Security</h2>
  <p> HMRC has a legal duty to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information. 
    We take all reasonable steps to protect any information you submit via our 
    website, both online and offline, in accordance with legislation such as the 
    Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
  <p>We take all appropriate steps to protect your personally identifiable information 
    as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect 
    such information for loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, 
    or destruction. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard 
    your data, and operate strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised 
    access to it.</p>
  <p>Where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on 
    this site, you also have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to safeguard 
    them.</p>
  <h2> Links to other websites</h2>
  <p> This site contains links and references to other websites. Please be aware 
    that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites and we encourage 
    you to read the Privacy Policy of every website you visit.</p>
  <h2> Notification of changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p> We will post details of any changes to our Privacy Policy on the website 
    to help ensure you are always aware of the information we collect, how we 
    use it, and in what circumstances, if any, we share it with other parties.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated May 2006.</p>
