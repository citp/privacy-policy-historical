This privacy statement is applicable to Indiainfoline.com. Indiainfoline.com does not collect personal information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personal information may be gathered for contest registration, the registration process for subscription sites or services and in connection with content submissions, community postings (e.g., message boards), suggestions, and voting/polling activities. Personal information on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from Indiainfoline.com and/or any third parties.

Indiainfoline.com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. Indiainfoline.com will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. Also, users should be aware that Indiainfoline.com may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through a Indiainfoline.com site.

Users are also being made aware that Indiainfoline.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for Indiainfoline.com. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available from Indiainfoline.com.
