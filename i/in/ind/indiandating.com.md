**What information does this site gather/track about you?**  
IndianDating.com is an online matchmaking service created to make it easier for our members and visitors to meet other individuals on the Internet. Our search engine and MatchMaker engine provide them with matches based upon their specified criteria. None of the information we gather can be used by the public (visitors, other members, and anyone not employed by IndianDating.com, its corporate affiliates, or the financial institutions we use to process membership charges) to identify a specific individual. Members choose when to disclose their personal information. 

We are a membership-based service. We collect the name and email address of standard Full account members. For Deluxe account members we collect credit card, address, or bank information only from those who choose to pay for a Deluxe account. No credit card information is stored on our servers. Anyone on the Internet can search our profiles, participate in the Community section, or sign up for a Full free account and use all standard member features at no charge. Anyone is also welcome to create a online profile/ad, free of charge. Members can choose to have their profile listed on any of the IndianMatches.com consortium of Indian relationship sites. All sites of IndianMatches.com are owned and operated by Webcapacity Incorporated and none of the information is shared with any third party. IndianDating.com gathers two types of information: information that users submit to us and information not directly submitted by users. 

**Information submitted to IndianDating.com**  
There are two types of information we collect that users submit: public and private. We define private information to be any information that allows others to contact a user other than through IndianDating.com or allows the collection of information about the user other than what is displayed on the site. Public information is personal information that may be displayed on the site, such as gender, age and height, but cannot be linked to a particular user. 

_Private Information:_   
The information gathered from free Full account members includes, email address, IP address, first and last name. 

The information gather from Deluxe members includes all of the above in addition to credit card info, address and other billing information. Credit card numbers are never committed to disk on our servers (stored on our servers). Credit card numbers are only used during real time authorization/billing so no one can get your credit card information. 

_Public Information:_   
To accomplish the goal of bringing compatible individuals together, we must gather personal information such as gender, age, appearance, caste, religion and more for the online profiles. This information is meant to be seen by members and visitors to the site but cannot be used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc. IndianDating.com discourages individuals from including contact information in their profile descriptions/text fields. Any contact/personal information that is disclosed in those areas is done so at the members own risk. 

Information that users do not submit to us is aggregate information: This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, such as what kind of browser you are using, IP address and occasionally traceroute output to your computer. This information is gathered for all visitors to the site. 

**What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks**  
_Private Information:_  
All information collected in the registration process is not accessible by other members. If a member has a profile on the site and another member contacts them, an email is sent to the member via the email address they signed up with. If the person contacted wishes to respond it is up to them how to do it and what they want to disclose. 

IndianDating.com will occasionally send out news/notices to all members. If the member wishes to be removed from this list they can login with their username and password. Go to their member home page and click on "Email preferences". There they can choose to be removed from the list.

Note that users occasionally submit lists of emails to our "Recommend Us" page. These emails are added to our future promotions mailing list. 

_Public Information:_  
Public information supplied by the user on their profile is intended to be viewed by visitors and members of the site. This information is disclosed by members at their discretion. 

Information that users do not submit to us is aggregate information: We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information in the general administration of our website and for tracking where people come from and other data. 

**With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks**  
IndianDating.com does not disclose any member information with any other third party. 

**About the Community section**  
Anyone can post messages or questions on the Q&A section or forums. Any information here is viewable by all visitors. Users should be careful about disclosing personal information in these sections. 

**About any links you may find on this site**  
Any links to sites outside of IndianDating.com or the IndianMatches.com sites, are not controlled or operated by IndianMatches.com. Hence this privacy information no longer applies when you leave this site. This includes links to partners, any banner ads, or links in individuals profiles etc. 

**What IndianDating.com does with cookies**  
Like thousands of other personalized websites on the Internet, the first time you connect to IndianDating.com, our server generates a random pair of numbers that is placed in three cookies, and set in your browser. This random pair of numbers is then sent back to the server each time you request a page on IndianDating.com. Our server uses those numbers to identify your computer, and for example, remember where you were in your search results or any of the various things that can be customized on IndianDating.com. Rest assured that there is absolutely NO PERSONAL information being stored on your machine or sent back and forth between your computer and IndianDating.com. Our cookies only store those two random numbers and cannot personally identify you. Note however that if you are a logged in member on a shared computer or public kiosk remember to click on LOGOUT! This will log you out of your session and prevent others from accessing your account. 

Also note that if you are a member and want to login, we provide two ways to do this. The first being a standard login which your username and password are transmitted in clear text, and the second being a SSL encrypted login form which transmits your username and password in a more secure encrypted fashion. Also note that, unlike some other sites which pass your username and password in each HTTP request's Authorization header, your username and password are only transmitted once and not each request. Once again, your username or password are not stored in a cookie. IndianDating.com also makes certain pages accessible via SSL to its members, such as billing history or editing/viewing your personal information. It is optional for members to use however we added it for our members convenience and privacy. For paying members also note that absolutely no credit card numbers are stored on our servers. 

Please note that IndianDating.com does use several third party ad agencies. Each agency may or may not set similar cookies to deliver ads to you. To find out more about these ad agencies and their privacy policies you can visit their websites at:
