[Indiana Public Records Act](http://www.ai.org/legislative/ic/code/title5/ar14/ch3.html): We are required to maintain many documents under the Indiana Access to Public Records Act, but we do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you or for other purposes required by law.

In accordance with Indiana public record statutes, we may be required to disclose the information you submit. If you use one of our online forms, the information you provide is up to you.

_Third Party Processing_ : Indy.gov will send Personally Identifiable Information about you to other companies, agencies, or people when:

  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Indy.gov to provide a product or service to you. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
