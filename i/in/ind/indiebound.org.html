If you have any questions about your rights as a user of our services, you may contact Dan Cullen, ABA Director Information Dept., via <a href="mailto:dan@bookweb.org">email</a>.</p>
<p>This privacy policy contains information about our commitment to your privacy, including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square; list-style-position: inside; margin-left:12px;"><li>The information we collect and how we use it;</li>
<li>Your right to access or update your personally identifiable information;</li>
<li>Your right to opt-out of receiving communications from us; and</li>
<li>Our pledge to have reasonable security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control.</li>
</ul><p>Note: This privacy policy applies to (i) personal information collected on <a href="http://www.indiebound.org" title="www.indiebound.org">www.indiebound.org</a> (the “Site”): and (ii) personal information collected offline or through other sources, unless otherwise noted. This privacy policy does not apply to the collection practices of any other company, including the web sites of other companies, individuals, or organizations to which we may provide links. These web sites may have different polices relating to your privacy and information they collect about you. Visitors should consult other sites’ privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or controlled by, third parties.</p>
<p>A. Information We Collect<br>
We may collect two types of information about you when you visit the Site, contact us, place an order, or in any other communication we may have with you: personal information such as, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card number), and, via the Site only, non-personal, aggregate information (such as information regarding the pages on our site you have visited and your IP address).</p>
<p>1. Personally Identifiable Information<br>
The only personally identifying information that we collect and store about you is the information that you have chosen to provide to us. For example, if you place an order with us, we may collect your name, mailing address, and credit card information. IN the alternative, if you register on the Site, we may collect your name, store name, your address, store address, e-mail address and other personal information so that we can process your registration. In addition, if you contact us via phone or send us e-mail requesting information about us or otherwise ask us a question, we may collect your name, phone number, address, e-mail address and other personal information so that we can respond to your request or question. We may also from time to time send you e-mail and postal correspondence regarding products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br>
From the Site, we may collect and use non-personally identifiable information about you in the following ways:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square; list-style-position: inside; margin-left:12px;"><li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address or the proxy address of your Internet Service Provider (e.g. AOL, CompuServe, Comcast, etc.);</li>
<li>The resource on our server accessed as a result of the request, such as the web page, image, etc.;</li>
<li>The query in the request;</li>
<li>The name and version of your web browser;</li>
<li>The content of any sent or received cookie, as defined below;</li>
<li>The Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that was accessed before making the request for our web server.</li>
</ul><p>a. Cookies<br>
Some parts of this Site web site may use a “cookie” – a file placed on your computer hard drive allowing our server to log the pages accessed in the Site to determine if you have visited before. This cookie captures no personally identifying information. You may set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it. Please not that by rejecting a cookie some of the features available on the site may not function properly.</p>
<p>b. Referrers, IP Addresses and Environmental Variables<br>
We may also collect information through “referrers,” IP addresses and various environmental variables. A "referrer" is information the web browser passes along to the ABA web server that references the URL from which you came. An “IP Address” is a number used by computers on a network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you. An “environmental variable” may include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed the web site, the type of web browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address or the web site you left to visit the web site, the pages you visit while at the web site and the Internet address of the web site you then visit.
