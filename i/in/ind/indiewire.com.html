<h1>indieWIRE Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>indieWIRE recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all our subscribers. We have instituted, therefore, the guidelines set forth below with a fundamental respect for our user's right to privacy guidelines and to establish the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. Due to the evolving nature of both the Internet and our business, it may be necessary to change these guidelines in the future. If we do so, however, we will post such changes on this page. In no circumstances, however, will we ever release your personal information without your consent, unless required to do so by law.</p>

<p><b>The Information We Collect</b><br>
If you have chosen to receive any of our free e-mail publications, we ask for an e-mail address to which you would like indieWIRE sent. We will only use your e-mail addresses to send the indieWIRE publications for which you have registered and special indieWIRE announcements.</p>

<p>If you choose to become an indieWIRE member, we ask you for some additional information that permits us to include you in the indieWIRE community as a member and build a "profile" of you as a member. To join our community, we ask you to choose a unique "handle" to identify yourself, to provide a valid email address, to enter and confirm a password of your choosing and to choose the publication(s) you would like to receive. In addition, you may choose to build a profile of yourself for other indieWIRE community members that includes your full name, your company, your title, your location, and other information.</p>

<p><b>Confidentiality</b><br>
We will use any information you give us solely to provide you and other members of the community with information about you <i><b>that you choose to make accessible to the community</b></i> and for us to communicate with members regarding our services and policies. Our site provides you with an option to make your profile private, public or available just to friends you approve whenever you choose to do so, though you must use your password to do so.</p>

<p>All indieWIRE customer-provided information is kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with any outside party. We do not sell or rent out your e-mail address to marketers. We will never intentionally disclose individually identifiable information to any third party without your permission. However, if we are ordered to so disclose such information by a court of proper jurisdiction or some other proper governmental order, we must comply with such an order.</p>

<p><b>Use of Information</b><br>
indieWIRE uses incoming and outgoing web site traffic data without individually identifiable user information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web sites. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. We may combine demographic information supplied by a user with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences as they relate to indieWIRE.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may agree with third parties to offer other services to indieWIRE readers on an optional basis. For any such agreements, our partners will only be permitted to contact you or offer you such services or information if you have agreed in advance to be contacted. They will also be required to disclose their privacy and information use policy to you at all times and you shall always have the right to opt-out of being contacted at your sole discretion.</p>

<p><b>Member Postings to indieWIRE</b><br>
If you are a registered indieWIRE member, you will be able to post comments and replies to any of our articles, participate in groups, post classifieds, announce events and communicate with each other through other services. Any posting to an article or thread from a member with a public profile will include that member's unique identifier handle and a link to your profile. If your profile is public, other members will be able to access your profile information, which includes your name and email address. This could result in unsolicited email being sent to you from other members or parties if you chose to share your email address. If a posting is from a person with a private profile, no personal information will appear with the posting, though the posting itself will become public.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
indieWIRE occasionally uses Cookies to better understand our user's experience on the site and does not share this information with any third party. indieWIRE also uses Cookies to help remember your preferences to better enhance you experience on our website. You may reset your cookie preference in your internet browser.</p>

<p><b>Unsubscribing</b><br>
Users may unsubscribe from any or all indieWIRE publications through "your settings" on the site. We may periodically contact past clients (advertisers and sponsors) via phone, e-mail or postal mail with new information about indieWIRE's products and services. If you would like to be removed from our past customer list, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:jd@indiewire.com"><b>jd@indiewire.com</b></a> and be sure to indicate your company name.</p>

<p><b>Links</b><br>
Remember that indieWIRE.com contains links to other sites, such as indieWIRE partners, advertisers and other content providers. When you "click" on a link or banner advertisement, you will leave the indieWIRE site and this Privacy and Information Use Policy will no longer be relevant or in effect for those other sites to which you arrive.  Those sites may have privacy and information use policies that differ from indieWIRE's policies, so please check them before submitting any information.</p>

<p><b>Questions</b><br>
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, indieWIRE practices, or feel that your privacy has been compromised, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jd@indiewire.com"><b>jd@indiewire.com</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Changes</b><br>
We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time at our sole discretion. We will not make any substantial changes to our policies, however, without notifying you that we have made changes. Please check this page periodically for changes.</p>

<p><b>FURTHER INFORMATION:</b><br>
For questions or for any further information, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:jd@indiewire.com"><b>jd@indiewire.com</b></a>.</p>
