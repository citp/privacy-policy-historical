## Your Data Collection Choices

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

  * _Tracking Technologies_. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

  * _Location_. Mobile applications may collect real-time information about the location of your device for geo-fencing, mileage tracking or similar purposes. If you do not want us to collect this information, you may decline our request or disable location services in your mobile device’s settings. However, opting out of the collection of location information will cause location-based features to be disabled and the online and/or mobile application may not function properly. Our services may also be able to identify your approximate location based on your IP address.
  * _Your Information and Third-Party Advertising_. We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.

You can also opt-out by adjusting your internet and/or mobile browser preferences.
  * _Promotional Offers from Indiana Tech_. If you do not wish to have your personal email address or other contact information used by Indiana Tech to promote our own or third parties’ products or services, you can opt-out at any other time by sending us an email stating your request to [privacy@indianatech.edu](mailto:privacy@indianatech.edu).
