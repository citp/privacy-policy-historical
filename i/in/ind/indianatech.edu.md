# Indiana Tech: IT Services: Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting your privacy at Indiana Tech. We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.

## Automated information collection

Indiana Tech collects information only in instances where we feel it will be of assistance in providing individuals with quality service. Indiana Tech routinely collects information used to create summary statistics in determining ways to improve online services. Information collected is vital to identifying system performance and/or problematic areas that need correction.

## Information collected through emails and web forms

When personally identifying information is submitted, such as email correspondence containing a question or comment, we use the supplied information to fulfill or respond to request(s). This information is also stored for reference when making improvements and/or adjustments to our website and online services. It should be noted that e-mail is a form of communication that is not entirely within a secure environment. Many of our web forms are completed in a secure environment and are generally more secure than typical email delivery.

## Use of information

Indiana Tech will not provide, sell or share your personal information to any nonaffiliated third party for independent use. We share information only in one of the following circumstances: a) you authorize it; b) you have requested a transaction requiring it; c) or we are required or permitted by law to disclose such information. Information may be shared with affiliated organizations when involving services of value to individuals, which would otherwise not be available through the university.

## Cookies

Like many other websites, Indiana Tech reserves the right to use cookies to identify individuals so they don’t have to re-enter a username and password when they, for example, wish to post to a discussion. Cookies also help us improve your experience and display more prominently programs and services that might interest you. If you do not have cookies enabled, you must enter your password each time you access our site or any of its member features.

## Security

We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you disclose both in your browsing and your purchases secure and to only release this information to third parties we believe share our commitment to privacy. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties.

## Links

This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Indiana Tech is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage you to be aware of when you exit our site and to become familiar with the privacy policies of each website that collects personally identifiable information.

## Obtaining your consent

If you register at Indiana Tech, you authorize Indiana Tech to use information you provide to personalize the information we deliver to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate customer data. Indiana Tech may occasionally amend this policy. We suggest that you bookmark this page and check to see whether it has changed from time to time.
