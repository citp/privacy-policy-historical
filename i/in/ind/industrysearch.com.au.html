				This section outlines the policies and definitions for 
				information published by INDUSTRACOM.<br>
				<br>
				Editorial integrity is a high priority to INDUSTRACOM 
				and as an Australian media &amp; information company, INDUSTRACOM 
				acknowledges a responsibility to publish relevant and accurate 
				news and information . We do not assume responsibility for damages or 
				inaccuracies as a result of information provided or published 
				online advertisers or other independent sources as we act 
				primarily as a conduit for information in these instances.</font></p>
				<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Information 
				published by INDUSTRACOM originates typically from the following 
				sources:<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>News Wire Services</i></u> -&nbsp; INDUSTRACOM 
				acquires information from news wire services including 
				Australian Associated Press Pty Limited (AAP) for which it is 
				licensed, authorised and under contract to publish relevant news 
				articles.<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>Advertisers</i></u> - Advertisers publish and submit 
				content to be featured by&nbsp;INDUSTRACOM. When 
				viewing advertiser information our system provides an indication 
				that content is associated with an advertiser by featuring their 
				name and/or logo together with a link to their profile 
				(Storefront), so as not to  
				confuse advertiser information&nbsp; with independent news sources. Only 
				selected 
				news &amp; feature articles provided by advertisers are published 
				group content 
				areas of the website (News Centre, Breaking News, 
				DailyNewsWire Email), whereas the majority of products and 
				events published by advertisers will be featured on group 
				content areas. All of a Storefront Advertiser's content will be 
				featured within their own independent Storefront page as well as 
				being searchable on the website. Storefront Advertisers have 
				password protected access to their own Storefront Management 
				Area where they can upload and publish information directly into 
				our system. All content submitted by Storefront Advertisers is 
				viewed and validated by INDUSTRACOM's editorial department 
				before going live on the website.<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>External Sources</i></u> -&nbsp; INDUSTRACOM 
				receives news, feature articles and events submitted from individuals, government, industry 
				and commercial organisations and determines at its own 
				discretion which information to publish. Selections are make 
				typically based on relevance to our audience, professionalism in 
				writing presentation and style and perceived accuracy of 
				information. INDUSTRACOM maintains full discretion in the 
				selection of information published on its websites.</font></p>

				INDUSTRACOM is firmly 
				committed to privacy in accordance with the Privacy Amendment Act 
			2000 and is bound by the National Privacy Principles (‘NPPs’), which were introduced into the Privacy Act 1988
            (Cth) (‘Privacy Act’) by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act
            2000.<br>
            <br>
            	INDUSTRACOM will update this privacy policy as required. If changed, the changes will be posted on 
				INDUSTRACOM's websites so that users are made aware of what information 
				is collected, how it is used and 
			when it may be disclosed. If at any time INDUSTRACOM is required by law to release information, 
			we are obliged to cooperate fully under our legal
            duty.<br>
            <br>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to acts or practices of 
				INDUSTRACOM that are directly related to employee records of current or former
            employees.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>Sponsor Messages</i></u> - All subscribers to 
				INDUSTRACOM's free e-mail newsletters automatically 
				receive sponsor messages. This is a condition of subscription. Sponsor messages subsidise 
				our newsletters and allow INDUSTRACOM to provide high quality 
				news and information free of charge, much like free-to-air 
				television. We make every effort maintain a good relationship 
				with our readers/subscribers and therefore limit the number of 
				sponsor messages sent and attempt to ensure they are relevant 
				and valuable offers.</font></p><p>
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><u><i>Unsolicited &amp; Lawful Offers</i></u> - 
			Requests placed with INDUSTRACOM advertisers must be of a legal and lawful nature and must be in 
			relation to the nature of business conducted by the advertiser.

			to solicit businesses in relation to items which have not been 
			requested (i.e. unsolicited offers).<br>

            Upon subscription we collect information such as company details 
			and job description. This information is collected in order to 
			profile and better understand our audience. News categories are 
			requested in order to provide relevant and personalised content and 
			information. Subscriber details are 
			protected and not supplied to&nbsp;outside organisations.<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Sponsored Advertising Campaigns</i></u> - We run sponsored 
				advertising campaigns on behalf of other businesses. Advertisers and 
			sponsors are at no time provided any specific details 
			of our audience or subscribers. Advertising campaigns are run by 
			INDUSTRACOM on 
			behalf of advertisers therefore no audience details or email addresses 
			are provided to advertisers. In instances when 
			advertising campaigns require registration or request information, 
			subscribers are made clearly aware that the response mechanism of 
			the advertising campaign will send information to the sponsor, 
				if readers/subscribers/visitors 
			participate.</font></p><p>
			<u><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Advertiser Requests</font></i></u><font face="Arial" size="2"> - When
            visitors sends an email 
			request

			details and contact information of the individual or company from 
			which the enquiry was sent. Requests are sent automatically to 
			advertisers by email and the same information is stored and viewable 
			in the advertisers' secure online management area.<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Search Terms</i></u> -
			When a search is performed, our system 
			gathers basic information such as the search word, search term, 
			date and the time the search was performed. We store and track this 
			information for internal trend analysis. Information such as who 
			performed the search is not gathered or tracked.<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Directory Categories</i></u> -
			When a category in our directory is clicked our system gathers basic 
			information such as the number of times each category is viewed. We 
			store and track this information for internal trend analysis. 
			Information such as who clicked the category is not gathered 
			or tracked.<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Content Interactions</i></u> -
			When content (contact details, products, 
			news, feature articles, events) is viewed or clicked upon our system 
			gathers basic information such as the number of times content is viewed. 
			We store and track this information for internal trend analysis 
			as well as providing Activity Tracking reports to Storefront advertisers, 
			so they can track and monitor the success of their advertising. Information 
			such as who viewed or clicked content is not gathered or 
			tracked. If visitors place a request to advertisers using one of our 
			online forms then this information is stored and provided to 
			advertisers.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">

			marketing 
			facility used to promote an advertisers

			<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#006699">Storefront 
			Advertising Service
			<br>
			</font></b>This is the primary advertising and marketing service 
			offered by INDUSTRACOM and the focus of these standard terms.<br>
			<br>
			<i><u>Getting started</u> - </i>To setup a Storefront, advertisers can 
			deal directly with INDUSTRACOM or with a reseller, advertising 
			agency or registered affiliate. <i><u><br>
			</u>Dealing Directly</i> - If 
			dealing directly with INDUSTRACOM, advertisers should print out, 
			complete and fax back a <i>Storefront Activation Form</i>.&nbsp; <i>
			<u><br>
			</u> Dealing with Resellers, Agencies or Affiliates</i> - If 
			dealing with a reseller, advertising agency or registered affiliate, 
			businesses should complete the joining process provided by that 
			reseller, advertising agency or registered affiliate. These 
			resellers, agencies and affiliates will then provide a proof 
			of purchase to INDUSTRACOM.<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Step 1 - Set-up Profile</i></u> - Once a <i>Storefront Activation 
			Form</i> is received, advertisers are sent an 
			e-mail outlining the requirements to setup their 
			Storefront's profile. This includes such items as a company 
			description, contact details and logo. Storefront Advertisers can 
			request for one of our consultants to setup their profile on their 
			behalf, using information found on the advertisers website or other 
			electronic promotional material provided.<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Step 2 - Upload Content</i></u> - Once Step 1 is completed, 
			Storefront owners are ready to upload their content (products, news 
			releases, feature articles and events), which is the most important 
			aspect of the Storefront in generating results. Storefront owners 
			are provided with a username and password to gain access to their 
			Storefront Management Area to upload content. Here a Storefront User 
			Guide helps advertisers understand how best to utilise their 
			Storefront. <br>
			<br>
			Storefront 
			owners should focus initially on having all their main
			Products &amp; Services 
			showcased in their 
			Storefront. 
			News releases, Feature articles and Events can then also be 
			uploaded. <br>
			<br>
			Each Storefront owner receives 1 hour of free setup work performed 
			by our consultants if requested. Free email support is provided and 
			additional setup or support packages can be purchased. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To generate the most effective results from your Storefront, we 
			urge businesses to keep their Storefront information up to date 
			with new products, services and other relevant information as soon 
			as it becomes available.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u><i>Trials and Refunds</i></u> - 
			Trials and refunds are not provided </font>
			<span class="852295801-20072005"><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>
			(except for special promotional offers) </em></font></span>
			<font face="Arial" size="2">however businesses can 
			participate in our <i>Satisfaction Guarantee Program</i> whereby they 
			can request a full refund if they are not  
			satisfied with the service following 90 days (<i>see next paragraph</i>).<br>
			<br>
			<u><i>Satisfaction Guarantee Program</i></u><br>
			Purchase a Storefront and if after 90 days you are not satisfied with 
			the results, you will receive a full refund. To qualify:<br>
			1. Advertisers must purchase for the Storefront using our standard payment 
			conditions (Credit Card or Invoice 30 Days).<br>

			3. Advertisers must have been in operation for 3 or more years.<br>
			4. All the advertisers' main products and services must have been 
			showcased within the Storefront. <br>
			We request customers contact us within 14 days following the 90-day 
			satisfaction period should they wish to request a refund.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u><i>Billing &amp; Payment</i></u><br>
				By entering into an agreement to setup a Storefront on 
				INDUSTRACOM, customers must pay for the service based on the 
				payment option selected during the sign-up process. Payment 
				options include:<br>
				<i>1. Yearly</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Invoice 30 Days. (Payment 
				options: Cheque, Credit Card or Direct Deposit)<br>
				<i>2. Monthly</i>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (Payment options: Credit 
				Card or Periodic Payment)&nbsp; - n/a for entry level Storefront.<br>
				</font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">*If paying 
				monthly, the first 
				monthly payment must be received before setup commences<br>
				*If paying monthly, Storefronts are a 1 year contract and 12 
				payments must be received in full.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
				<br>
				By activating a Storefront, advertisers enter into a binding 
				agreement, therefore payments issues could result in a 
				collection agency's involvement which could affect an 
				advertiser's 
				credit rating.</font></p>
