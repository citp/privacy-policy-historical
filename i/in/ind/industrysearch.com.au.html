                <p>
                    <b>Search</b><br> The website's search facilities are driven by the Microsoft
                    SQL Server standard free text search algorithm. The search is implemented using
                    Microsoft SQL Sever 2005 fulltext search features known as "CONTAINSTABLE" and "FREETEXTTABLE".
                    The "CONTAINSTABLE" feature makes use of a "search phrase" and the number of occurrences
                    to derive the ranking for content whereas the "FREETEXTTABLE" search makes use of
                    the OKAPI BM25 ranking formula. The detail of each feature is provided in the following
                    link http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524.aspx. The key highlights
                    of a search using these features is described below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A search calculates rankings based on the search string provided by the user. The
                        ranking is based on predefined search algorithms bundled with SQL Server 2005.</li>
                    <li>The search term and each individual term within the search string is ranked, and
                        the values are summed to arrive at a final ranking score.</li>
                    <li>There are a large number of words which occur very frequently and are not helpful
                        in resolving searches. Such words are referred to as noise words. For example words
                        which linguists class as articles, such as the, a, and at are for the most part
                        irrelevant in a search. These words are not included as part of a search.</li>
                    <li>The ranking for terms is decided based on ethical frequency of terms and the density
                        or frequency of search terms occurring relative to the other terms. </li>
                    <li>The search will also add words to the query via inflectional generation (stemmed
                        forms of the original query terms); For example if the user query contains 'label'
                        word, the search will also look for words like 'labeling', 'labeled' etc. These
                        words are treated as separate terms with no special weighting or relationship with
                        the words from which they were generated. </li>
                    <li>Synonyms generated from the Thesaurus feature are treated as separate, equally weighted
                        terms to determine ranking.</li>
