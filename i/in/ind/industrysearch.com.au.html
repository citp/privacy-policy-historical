<u>Search</u><br>
The Storefront search is driven by the standard free text search algorithm 
provided by Microsoft SQL Server. The search is implemented uses using Microsoft 
SQL Sever 2005 fulltext search features known as "CONTAINSTABLE" and "FREETEXTTABLE". 
The "CONTAINSTABLE" feature make use of "search phrase" and the number of 
occurrence to derive the ranking for a Storefront whereas the "FREETEXTTABLE" 
search make use of a well known ranking formula called OKAPI BM25 to determine 
the ranking. The detail of each feature is provided in the following link
<a target="_blank" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524.aspx">
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524.aspx</a>. The key highlights 
of the search using these feature is described below: </font>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">A search looks within two databases: 
	"Company" and "Products". The fields being searched in the "Company" 
	database are "Business Name", "Description", "Keywords", "Comments", "City" 
	and "State. For "Products" the fields being searched are "Name", "Introduction" and 
	"Full Content".</font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">A search calculates a ranking for each 
	Storefront based on the search string provided by the user. The ranking is 
	based on predefined search algorithms bundled with SQL Server 2005.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The search term and each individual term 
	with-in the search string is ranked, and the values are summed to arrive at 
	a final ranking score.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">There are a large number of words which 
	occurred very frequently and which are not helpful in resolving searches. 
	Such words are referred to as noise words. For example words which linguists 
	class as articles, such as the, a, and at are for the most part irrelevant 
	in a search. This words are not included as part of search.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The rank for the terms is decided based on 
	frequency of the term and the density or frequency of the search term 
	occurring relative to the other terms. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The search will also add words to the 
	query via inflectional generation (stemmed forms of the original query 
	terms); For example if the user query contains 'label' word, the search will 
	also look for words like 'labeling', 'labeled' etc. These words are treated 
	as separate terms with no special weighting or relationship with the words 
	from which they were generated. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Synonyms generated from the Thesaurus 
	feature are treated as separate, equally weighted terms to determine 
	ranking.</font></li>
</ul>
