                        Because your privacy is important to us, IndexTools.com 
                        Statistics conducts its business under the following principles: 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Principle 1 - No Collection of Personal Information</b><br>
                        IndexTools.com does not collect personal information such 
                        as name, age, phone number and mailing address from visitors

                        <br>
                        <b>Principle 2 - No Combination of Browsing and Web Traffic 
                        Information with Personal Information</b><br>
                        Since IndexTools.com does not collect any personal information, 
                        we do not combine traffic analysis information with personal 
                        information such as name, age, phone number and mailing 
                        address. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Principle 3 - No Aggregation of Individual Visitor 
                        Traffic Patterns across Multiple Sites</b><br>
                        IndexTools.com does not collect individual profile information 
                        for visitors across multiple sites and does not aggregate 
                        information from any other sources about browsing patterns 
                        of individual visitors across multiple sites. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Principle 4 - Use of Anonymous IP Address</b><br>
                        IP addresses are recorded by every site on the internet. 
                        IndexTools.com collects this information as well, but 
                        does so exclusively for the following uses: (1) anonymous 
                        statistical purposes; or (2) administration of our web 
                        site and servers, and to improve our services. <br>

                        <b>Principle 5 - Anonymous Use of Cookies</b><br>
                        It is IndexTools.com Statistics's policy to use cookies 
                        only for more accurate anonymous traffic analysis. The 
                        cookie information does NOT include personal data such

                        address. In addition, IndexTools.com does NOT link cookies 
                        to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail

                        <br>
                        <b>Principle 6 - No Individual Profiling</b><br>
                        IndexTools.com Statistics does not create individual profiles 
                        for visitors. Unlike other tracking services we do not 
                        have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. 
                        IndexTools.com Statistics collects data in aggregate form 
                        and data is not recorded or stored for individual visitors.

                        <br>
                        <b>Principle 7 - Limited Use of Cookies</b><br>
                        IndexTools.com Statistics uses cookies to track such as 
                        the time/date of the visit, the time/date of last visit, 
                        the page viewed, the referrer, transaction information 
                        for eCommerce pages, and other data. The cookies never 
                        include personal information such as name, mailing address 
                        and phone number. We do not collect such information and 
                        visitors that we track can not provide us with personal 
                        information through normal movement across a web site. 
                        As we do not build a database of individual visitors, 
                        the data that we do collect is never stored in any individual 
                        user profile; the data collected serves only to update 
                        aggregate counts allowing our customers to monitor traffic 
                        on their site. Visitors can also reject cookies. <br>
