** Cookies  
**  
A "cookie" is very small text file placed on your hard drive by a Web Page server. It serves as your personal identification card, and cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. It is uniquely yours and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. The purpose of a "cookie" is to tell the server that you returned to that Web page. Of course, if you never register or leave personal information with indianotes.com, then the server only knows that someone with your cookie has returned to the Web site. You are in charge of deciding whether we know anything about you. 

When you come to our site or when you register with our site, we create your personal profile, assign a personal identification number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a "cookie," which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It enables us to know more about you, allows you to utilize some of our website's functionality, and correspond with us about your personal profile without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. We use cookies to record session information, such as items that you added to your shopping cart and to conduct marketing tests on our Web pages. By showing how and when you use the site, cookies help us see which areas and products are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide better services to our visitors’  needs. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
