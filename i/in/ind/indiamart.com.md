# IndiaMART Privacy Policy

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. The policy may change from time to time so please check periodically.

Wherever IndiaMART collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

This includes personalization services, interactive communications and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, IndiaMART is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.

> When you are on a IndiaMART site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with IndiaMART alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than IndiaMART, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.

> Promotions that run on IndiaMART may be sponsored by companies other than IndiaMART or may be co-sponsored by IndiaMART and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don’t want your data to be shared.

In addition, if you indicate upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from IndiaMART and its partners, IndiaMART may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that it feels may be of interest to you. Only IndiaMART or agents working on behalf of IndiaMART and under confidentiality agreements, will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicate that you do not object to these offers.

Whenever IndiaMART handles personal information as described above regardless of where this occurs, IndiaMART takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Services and this Privacy Policy.

> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while IndiaMART strives to protect your personal information, IndiaMART cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to IndiaMART and you do so at your own risk. Once IndiaMART receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security on its systems. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online-for example on message boards or through email -that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
