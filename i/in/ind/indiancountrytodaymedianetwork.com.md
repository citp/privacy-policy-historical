**“Cookies”**

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.  We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie terminates when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie is stored for an extended period of time.

Cookies allow us to recognize your computer while you are on Indian Country Today Media Network.com and when you return to Indian Country Today Media Network.com and help customize your online experience and make it more convenient for you.  Cookies are also useful in tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions.  The information collected from cookies may also be used to improve the functionality of Indian Country Today Media Network.com.

Most web browser applications (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Firefox) have features that can notify you when you receive a cookie or prevent cookies from being sent. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain personalized functions of this website.

**Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ a software technology called clear GIFs (sometimes called web beacons or web bugs), to learn what content users find effective.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. We may tie information collected through the use of Clear GIFs to users’ personally identifiable information.

Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same web site.  For example, clear GIFs enable us to match the Clear GIF identifier with a cookie ID number to show the past online behavior for a particular computer.

In addition, we use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
