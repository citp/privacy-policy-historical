# Privacy Policy | Inductive Automation

## 1\. Introduction

Inductive Automation, LLC, doing business as Inductive Automation (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company’s Websites (“the Sites”). This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of our website visitors and customers; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data. We created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use any of our Sites, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to our Sites and our business, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from any of our Sites, each of which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.

## 2\. Information Collection Practices

### 2.1. Types of Information Collected

(a) Traffic Data Collected
    Depending on which of our Sites you visit, we automatically track and collect one or more of the following categories of information when you visit our Sites: (1) IP addresses; (2) internet service provider; (3) types of device accessing the Site; and (4) type of operating system and web browser used to access any particular Site (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you, but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. We also use “cookies” and similar technologies to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your session so you do not have to re-enter your password each time you visit the Site. Please review our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies "cookie policy") for more information.
(b) Personal Information Collected
    In order for you to access certain premium services and to purchase products that we offer via certain of our Sites, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, IP address and e-mail address); (2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); (3) Demographic Data (such as your postal code, industry and/or occupation); (4) Cookies placed on your device and (4) Content Data (such as your history of use, results, etc.). As mentioned above, some of this information is obtained through the use of cookies. If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.

### 2.2. Uses of Information Collected

(a) Company Use of Information
    

We use Contact Data to send you information about our company or our products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary. For some Site users, your information is shared with our partners located in the European Union (“EU”). This sharing of information is subject to a Joint Controller Agreement executed by the Company and its EU partner. We may also share your personal information with a third party that provides processing services for us, in which case we will only share that information with a third party with whom we have executed a Processor Agreement. The Processor Agreement will set forth the third party’s agreement to meet the requirements of the EU for processors of personal information of EU residents. We use your Financial Data to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products and services. We use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on any of our Sites that you visit, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. We use your Content Data to review and improve our Sites. We may process any of your personal data identified in this policy where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. We may also process any of your personal data identified in this policy where necessary for the purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance coverage, managing risks or obtaining professional advice. The legal basis for each use outlined above is, where applicable, either your consent or the legitimate business interest in the proper administration of our Sites and business.

(b) Use of Camera or GPS in our App
    

If you use our mobile app, you may use your camera feature to scan barcodes or take pictures for use in the app. Any pictures taken by you while in our mobile app are used while you are in the app only and are not stored by us in any manner whatsoever. Similarly, any use of your GPS function while in our mobile app is to allow you to use features of that app only. We do not store any of this data. We only use your location within the app and only with your explicit permission. You can turn GPS tracking off at any time.
