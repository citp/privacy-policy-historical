Your privacy is important, so IndieGameStand ("IndieGameStand," “The Company,” "we," "us," or "our") has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit the Service, why we collect it and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of the Service; it does not apply to other online or offline Company sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the customer/purchaser utilizing our Service. This Privacy Policy is governed by our Terms of Use. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.

**What Information Is Collected?**

IndieGameStand collects the following Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use our Service: your email address, and payment information (credit card and address, PayPal, or Amazon information). If you correspond with us by email or through the Service, we may retain the content of your messages, your email address and our responses.

IndieGameStand also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features.

**How Is Such Information Used?**  
We use the data that you provide or we collect to provide you the services offered on our Service. The Company uses your email address to create an account and organize your game download page and to notify you of future promotions if you sign-up for our newsletter.

IndieGameStand uses the data you enter on the Service, such as the price you enter, to make sure that your contributions go to the right places. We also may use the site data collected to produce general and anonymous statistics about consumer behavior.

We may use certain information about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.

**Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?**  
IndieGameStand does not sell or share the information it collects hereunder except as described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected from you is disclosed and used to complete and support your purchases from and use of our Service and to comply with any requirements of law. For example, we may disclose information to third party payment processors. We may also disclose information to third party social networks at your direction, e.g. when you "tweet" or "like" something on the Service.

From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.

IndieGameStand may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on IndieGameStand or the Service; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of IndieGameStand; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of IndieGameStand, its web sites or the public. If IndieGameStand or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IndieGameStand goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IndieGameStand may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
