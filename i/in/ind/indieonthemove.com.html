<p>
	 In order to use the Services, we require that users submit personal information (e.g. full name, e-mail address, country of residence, age).

All such personal information is collected for the purpose of providing our users access to the Services registered user features. We do not require a user to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use these features.&nbsp;We will collect information about you when you register to post messages on one of our discussion forums, when you register to use the Services, when you transmit information to us via our Services (including, without limitation, by email), when you participate in one of our promotions, and when you otherwise use our Services. By doing any of the foregoing, you consent to this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.</p>

Personal information provided by registered members, namely the member’s user name and e-mail address, will not be shared with third parties. However, we may permit a user to log in to our Services using credentials on selected third-party services and from other methods that we may allow from time to time (including, for example, by logging in using credentials established with us directly).&nbsp; By logging in to our Services using third-party service, you permit us and the Services to connect to such third party and to access and use all information related to your account with such third party that is made available to us by the third party.&nbsp; If you allow our Services to connect with a third-party service, you will be able to use your third-party service login information to log in to our Services, and we will publish certain of your activities on the Services, and certain of the information you provide to the Services, to your profile and/or wall or other presence(s) on such third-party service.

	<strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>
	We may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services. &nbsp;We use cookies to collect this information.&nbsp; “Cookies” are files that your web browser saves to your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. These files contain information that allows websites to “remember” user activities on a website and user visits to a site, and may include storage of user preferences, user ID and password, if applicable.

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In addition, when you use our Services, our system may automatically collect certain information. For example, when you visit our Site or other portions of our Services, our system may automatically collect information such as your web or content request, your other actions on the Services (e.g., adding a track as a favorite), Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and the unique identity of your browser. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our Services, improve the design of our Services, track user movement, customize certain content or features on the Services, and otherwise enhance the services we provide. Additionally, we may retain, use, and disclose certain of this information in a manner combined with your email address or other personal information that we maintain about you. If we do so, we will treat any such information that is combined with personal information in accordance with the provisions of this policy pertaining to our use and disclosure of personal information.&nbsp;</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>SHARING OR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>
	If you join as an administrator for an artist or a band, you may, at your option, choose to input various types of information regarding the artist or band, such as, for example, a contact email address, a URL for a website for the artist or band, a telephone number, a biography for that band or artist, photographs (and data associated with such photographs), songs, videos, and links to songs and videos on third-party services (and data associated with such songs and videos), songs and other audio files, tour dates, links to where fans can purchase tickets, information regarding products or services you may place for sale using any e-commerce functionality we make available on the Services, and other information regarding your band’s or artist’s shows.

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Additionally, we will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. For example, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your account on to a third-party service or have elected to have your activity published to a third-party service. To control the information that your share, you should review and, if appropriate, modify your privacy settings on the third-party service. We may provide your personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal business functions (e.g., payment processing, data analysis, email transmission, or data hosting) on our behalf. Some third-party service providers may also collect information, including personal information, on our behalf. In our agreements with these third-party service providers, we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such personal information and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services to us.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We reserve the right to disclose information about you, including data on which pages you have visited and other information regarding your use of the Services, to third parties if we feel it is necessary to protect our systems, website, business, users or others. In addition, information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of Indie On The Move LLC. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.</p>
