		<div class="black11B">Important Privacy Choices for Consumers</div>
		<div>At IndymacBank<sup>®</sup> we value the trust you have placed in us, and we are committed to earning and maintaining your confidence. We understand there is certain information you do not want to share with everyone, and, we share your concern about safeguarding the information you provide to us. This is why we have adopted this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy is provided to you by each of the companies within the IndymacBank family that are listed at the end of this Privacy Policy. For convenience, these companies are referred to as "Indymac," "we," "us," "our," or "ours." The words "you," "your," or "yours" refer to each individual who is one of our customers or former customers and other individuals who obtain or request a financial product or service from us.</div>
		<br>
		<div class="black11B">Information Collection</div>
		<div>This Privacy Policy describes the kinds of information we collect, how we use that information and the limited circumstances under which we share it.</div>
		<br>
		<div>We collect information about you that we believe will be necessary or useful in processing or administering products or services that you have requested from us. We will also collect information in order to notify you about products, services and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>This information may be collected from a variety of sources, such as the following: (1) information provided by you in applications or other forms, or in connection with obtaining financial products and services such as mortgage loans, deposit accounts, and investment products and services, (2) information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, and (3) information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others.</div>
		<br>
		<div class="black11B">Maintenance of Accurate Information</div>
		<div>We work hard to ensure your information is as accurate, current and complete as possible. If you ever find that our records are inaccurate or not current, please contact us at the telephone number on your account statement. If the record is within our control, we will correct any inaccurate or incomplete information.</div>
		<br>
		<div class="black11B">Security Procedures to Protect Customer Information</div>
		<div>Access to our systems containing nonpublic personal information is only provided to those employees and agents whom we determine need it for the purpose of providing products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.</div>
		<br>
		<div class="black11B">Information Sharing Within Our Affiliated Family of Companies</div>
		<div>There are times when we will share a portion of your nonpublic personal information with our affiliated companies that either currently exist or that we may create or acquire in the future. However, we will only do so in order to provide you with superior service, inform you of product and service opportunities that may be of interest to you, improve and develop our products and services, or perform other business functions. An "affiliated company" or "affiliate" is any member of our family of companies or any company that we own or control.</div>

We may disclose all of the information we collect (described in "Information Collection" above) to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.</div> 
<br>
<div>Our agreements with these companies are subject to confidentiality provisions and restrictions that prohibit using the information beyond the performance of the specified services or in connection with the jointly marketed product or service.</div>
