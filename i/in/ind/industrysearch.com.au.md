We take no responsibility and assume no liability as a result of actions or issues resulting from information or advice found on our resources and digital channels.

 **Editorial content sources**

Editorial news content originates from sources such as AAP, Reuters, government and industry bodies. Other editorial content originates from contributors commissioned by us.

Editorial content is marked  , or is identified as such by not linking with an active Supplier.

 **Supplier content sources**

_Storefront Suppliers_ \- Storefronts are a paid annual package on our websites that generate enquiries for businesses by showcasing their products & services, media releases & videos.

Storefront content is marked  , or is branded as such by linking to an active Storefront.

Storefront owners have access to add content using an online submission area. Submitted content is reviewed by us before going live.

_Non-Paying Suppliers_ \- Our websites also feature complimentary supplier listings which have been researched and added by our editors or originate from expired paying Storefronts. Only paying suppliers have direct access to leads generated on our websites. We manage leads sent to non-paying suppliers as determined by us. Non-paying suppliers can choose not to be listed by contacting us.

_Market Vendors_ \- In addition to paying and non-paying suppliers we also showcase businesses under our Market Vendor program. This is a pay for performance service whereby suppliers are promoted in exchange for a commission on sales that originate from us.

A listing can only be requested by a local employee of a business who has provided a local and  contactable phone number and personal company email address. To qualify, businesses must supply products and/or services targeted towards our specific audiences.

## System Specifications

 **Search**

Our search facilities use commercial grade search and indexing technology. Features include:

  * The search calculates rankings based on the search string provided by the user. Rankings are based on predefined search algorithms within our technology.
  * The search term and each individual term within the search string are ranked, and the values are summed to arrive at a final ranking score.
  * There are a large number of words which occur very frequently and are not helpful in resolving searches. Such words are referred to as noise words. For example words which linguists class as articles, such as the, a, and at are for the most part irrelevant in a search. These words are not included as part of a search.
  * The ranking for terms is decided based on ethical frequency of terms and the density or frequency of search terms occurring relative to the other terms.
  * The search will also add words to the query via inflectional generation (stemmed forms of the original query terms); For example if the user query contains 'label' word, the search will also look for words like 'labeling', 'labeled' etc. These words are treated as separate terms with no special weighting or relationship with the words from which they were generated.
  * Synonyms generated from the Thesaurus feature are treated as separate, equally weighted terms to determine ranking.
