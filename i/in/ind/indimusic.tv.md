Confidentiality and Security   
Since specific information is required in order to utilize Indimusic.tv’s search and shopping cart capabilities, securing your privacy is our first priority. That's why IndiMusicTV.com is designed with the most advanced technology and security measures. IndiMusicTV.com has established safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information. Furthermore, we will honor this commitment with respect to information we have in our possession even after you have been placed in contact with our sponsors and their promotions at your own discretion. 

[Personal, financial and any important data transmitted through Indimusic.tv - including all personal information you submit - is protected using 128-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to make your connection to our server completely confidential. Using the site requires a SSL-capable browser such as MS Internet Explorer 5.0 (or later) and Netscape Navigator 7.0 (or later). 

SSL technology ensures that only you, Indimusic.tv and our insurance agents and underwriters - upon your authorization - can access the information you submit. The data you provide is immediately translated into code, and can only be decoded by Indimusic.tv. SSL confirms the identity of the originating computer terminal and the recipient terminal, preventing unauthorized interception.

Please note that the above is pending and due soon. All information will be sent securely regardless of site status.
