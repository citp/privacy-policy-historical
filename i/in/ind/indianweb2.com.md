# Privacy Policy

## IndianWeb2.com Social Reader Privacy Policy

Indianweb2.com Social Reader is a free Facebook app that lets you easily share what you are reading and see what your friends are reading! In addition, the app uses the articles you read and those read by your friends to help personalize your experience.

This privacy policy describes what happens within the Social Reader app, but not what happens on Facebook outside of the app. In general, you are likely to be on Social Reader if you see the Social Reader logo in the top left corner.

If you do not see the Social Reader logo and you see the Facebook logo, it is likely that what you see is controlled by Facebook. [Click here](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ "Go to Facebook's privacy policy page") to view Facebook’s privacy policy for more detail on their practices.

### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I READ AN ARTICLE IN THE SOCIAL READER APP?

When you authorize the Social Reader app, you may select who on Facebook can see the stories you post to Facebook. We look at your initial selection and apply it for your audience in the Social Reader app in a manner that is at least as protective of your privacy.

If you have set your Facebook audience for the Social Reader app to Friends or Public, activity within Social Reader (e.g., reading an article) may be shared for up to 30 days after that activity in the following ways:

  * Within the Social Reader app, we share your activity with your Facebook friends that also use the app when they are in the app.
  * Outside Facebook and the Social Reader app, we may present your activity to your Facebook friends on partner websites in widgets branded with Social Reader.



Alternatively, if you have set your Facebook audience for the Social Reader app to Only Me or Custom when you first authorize the app, activity within Social Reader will not be shared with others in the ways described above – that is, within the Social Reader app or on partner websites in websites branded with Social Reader.

Note: we’ll try to keep your preferences up to date, but if you change your Facebook settings after you first authorize the Social Reader app, your app setting changes may not be immediate.

We automatically share your Social Reader activity with Facebook. Facebook’s policies control how your Social Reader activity may be displayed on Facebook outside of the Social Reader app. See [below](http://www.indianweb2.com/privacy-policy#anchor_controlactivity "Jump to read about controlling activity display outside of Facebook") for more information.

### HOW CAN I HIDE THE FACT THAT I HAVE READ A PARTICULAR ARTICLE?

We understand that in some circumstances you may not want others to see what you are reading.You may delete publication of the fact that you have read an article. To do so, uncheck the checkmark in the sidebar of indianweb2.com.

By clicking the Remove from Your Reads button, the fact that you read the particular article will no longer be visible inside the Social Reader app or within a Social Reader widget on another website. It will also be deleted from within Facebook.

### CAN I DISABLE THE SOCIAL READER APP?

Yes, you can disable the Indianweb2.com Social Reader app by following the instructions [here.](https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=170585223002660 "Read about Facebook privacy settings")

### HOW CAN I CONTROL HOW SOCIAL READER ACTIVITY IS DISPLAYED ON FACEBOOK OUTSIDE OF THE APP?

Your activity on the Social Reader app, such as the articles you read, is shared with Facebook. The display of Social Reader activity inside Facebook is handled solely by Facebook.
