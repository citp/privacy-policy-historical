# Privacy - Index Exchange

**Last Updated** : May 25, 2018

Index Exchange, Inc. (“Index Exchange”) believes in all Internet users’ rights to privacy. This Policy explains the information collection, use, and disclosure practices of Index Exchange. It applies to all information received by Index Exchange whether in electronic, paper or verbal format.

**_THE INDEX EXCHANGE BUSINESS_**

The Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange (“Index Platform”) prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users. Our proprietary targeting methodologies enable advertisers to effectively target their campaigns to the audience(s) they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices. Services offered by Index Exchange include a Web-based advertising exchange marketplace that enables publishers, advertisers, and ad networks to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile advertising and ad inventory.

Through its ad server, Index Exchange also acts as a service provider to enable its publishers, advertisers, ad networks and other clients to collect and use data for advertising purposes on their digital and mobile platforms across the Internet.  Publishers may use our services to process consumer data, which they collect or source. Their data collection, use, and sharing practices may be governed by their own privacy policies and differ from those found in Index Exchange’s Privacy Policy. We encourage you to refer to the privacy policies of any websites you visit and apps you use, to learn about their privacy practices before disclosing any personal information to them.

### ** ** ** _INDUSTRY SELF-REGULATION_**

Index Exchange prides itself on conducting business in a transparent and open manner. In line with those values, we support efforts for self-regulation in the internet-based advertising industry.

**_ _** ** _NAI_**

Index Exchange is a member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to responsible data collection for digital advertising, building consumer awareness, and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. Index Exchange adheres to the NAI [Code of Conduct](https://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code) in all its operations.

** ** ** _DAAC_**

Index Exchange adheres to the standards and practices outlined by The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, a consortium of the leading national advertising and marketing trade associations, promoting a self-regulatory program for online interest-based advertising. More information on the program can be found [here](http://www.youradchoices.ca/).

**_ _** ** _INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING_**

In general, like most standard website servers, Index Exchange uses log files to track transactions. These log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types used, the internet service provider (ISP) utilised, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamps, and number of clicks. This information is then used to analyze trends, administer the site, aggregately track user movement, and target advertisements to users accordingly. Index Exchange does not collect a website user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as defined under United States federal law. However, in the course of and for purposes of conducting its business, Index Exchange may collect and process the following consumer information that is considered Personal Information (PI)  under the Canadian [Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/) or Personal Data under the European Union’s [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/) (GDPR):

(1) browser and device information received from publishers is shared with advertisers and agencies for responding to requests for advertisements, forecast advertising inventory and troubleshooting any operation issues related to the Index Platform;

(2) IP addresses, including both IPv4 and IPv6 are used to bid on advertising inventory;

(3) geo-location data is used to bid on advertising inventory;

(4) Precise Location Data (data obtained from a device about the physical location of the device) is used to bid on advertising inventory;

(5) GPS coordinates, where available;

(6) unique Index Exchange UserIDs, stored in browser cookies, are used for profiles on the ad server;

(7) mobile device identifiers are used to track mobile traffic and are shared with advertisers and agencies to tailor the advertising experience;

(8) Pixel Data (data obtained through or in connection with the placement of any pixel mechanism) is used as part of the user matching process;

(9) people identifiers provided by Index Exchange’s partners are associated to audience segments, and shared with advertisers and agencies;

(10) data on whether a user viewed or clicked on an Ad is shared with advertisers and agencies.

Index Exchange’s internal processes treat personal data in accordance with regulatory requirements and applicable privacy laws to ensure that information is stored securely and used only for allowed and intended purposes.

Index Exchange may combine information that does not directly identify an individual with data collected from other sources to provide publishers, advertisers and ad networks with information to improve the relevance of advertising presented to users and determine whether to bid on ad inventory _. Any information shared with advertisers and publishers within the Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange is done so in an aggregate fashion. This means that clients only receive information about users targeted by advertisements in a format with broad percentages._

In addition, although Index Exchange does not directly engage in Cross-App Advertising, our technology may collect and/or pass through Mobile Device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer) or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you.

** ** ** _Do Not Track Signal_**

Index Exchange does not honor the ‘DNT’ browser signal. Instead, we utilize the cookie based opt-out mechanisms to allow users to opt-out of all advertising. _For more information, please see the “Your Choices” section below._

**_Cross-Device Linking_**

Cross-Device Linking is the process of making assumptions that certain devices are related to each other, i.e. they belong to the same user/household. Index Exchange may engage in Cross Device Linking for personalized advertising, ad delivery, and reporting. _If you would like to opt-out of having Cross-Device Linking used by Index Exchange on your devices, please see the “Your Choices” section below._

**_Cookies_**

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computer and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Index Exchange uses both session and persistent cookies on our website. These are needed for site navigation and to perform aggregate analysis of what is viewed on our site. Cookies are considered Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Index Platform uses cookies for tracking when an Internet user has seen an advertisement. These cookies serve two purposes:

  1. To inform the Index Platform if an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served. _These cookies are not used by Index Exchange to build a profile of a user’s behavior nor are they used by Index Exchange for the purposes of behavioral tracking or behavioral targeting._
  2. To facilitate retargeting at a campaign level. Retargeting is the process of serving an ad from a particular advertiser to a user, based on the fact that the user has previously visited the advertiser’s website. Retargeting occurs within the confines of a user-to-advertiser relationship, and is not available for general targeting on Index Exchange. Retargeting is not available for Sensitive Data as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation.



**_PII, PI, and Personal Data of Index Exchange Members_**

Registering to become a member of the Index Platform and use of the Index Exchange User Interface, either as an advertiser or a publisher, requires the submission of PI, PII or Personal Data to Index Exchange. This can include the full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. Index Exchange uses this information to service its accounts and respond to inbound inquiries related to sales or technical support requests. Communications to business users are related to the Advertising Exchange. All such information submitted is held by Index Exchange in strict confidence and as prescribed by corresponding regulatory authorities.

Index Exchange does not engage in any form of distribution or sale of PII, PI or Personal Data to third parties for their own promotional use. Index Exchange does not sell, supply, or otherwise make user PII, PI or Personal Data available to any third party under any circumstances, unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**_Information Obtained from Third Parties_**

Index Exchange may obtain data from third party companies for the purpose of informing ad selection. This data is supplied in aggregate form and may include Personal Data as defined under the GDPR. Advertisers who are clients of Index Exchange may collect PII and Personal Data on their own websites. These details are provided directly by the individual Internet user through online order forms, contests, etc. PII or Personal Data provided through an advertiser’s website is not visible to Index Exchange while being entered, nor provided to Index Exchange at any time in the future. This personal data collected by the advertiser is subject to the privacy policy of the individual advertiser involved.

**_YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES_**

**_Web Browser Option to Opt-Out_**

Some of the ads you see on the internet or in applications on your mobile device are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the applications on your mobile device. This type of ad tailoring — sometimes called “interest-based” or “online behavioral” advertising — is enabled through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies. Tailored digital ads help support the free products, services and content you enjoy online. To help protect your privacy, Index Exchange (along with other NAI members) has voluntarily agreed to abide by high NAI standards including offering an opt-out mechanism.

Opting out of interest-based advertising means that you will no longer be shown ads that have been tailored to your interests. It does not mean you will no longer see advertising online. When you opt-out, an opt-out cookie will be stored in your web browser signaling your opt-out preference to NAI members including Index Exchange.

Please note that if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies, then the opt out cookie may not work. If you delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again. The opt-out will not apply to the specific browser in which you set it. The opt-out process must be repeated for each different browser.
