####  **Cookies and IP Addresses**

Throughout the Independent Living News website, we will periodically use cookies to track general user workflow throughout the website simply in order to enhance the user experience for each of our customers. For example, we will use cookies to notify a customer that they have just read an article after going back to a category listing page. In this way the user will not need to waste time going into each article to figure out whether they have read it or not. We also use these cookies to stop frequent advertisements or other promotional banners from being shown too often. These cookies also help us build trends relative to the paths customers take on our website, to better optimize content layout and other site structure details. The whole goal of using cookies for us is to simply provide a better service online. We highly suggest keeping cookies enabled when using the Independent Living News website, as it will affect the overall functionality of the site if they are disabled. Although, please be aware that you can stop cookies from being used through your personal web browser's settings. 

We also collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include a user’s IP (internet protocol) address, ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser the user utilized to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the length of time the user spent our site and which pages were visited throughout our site. This is done through a service called Google Analytics. Independent Living News may use data contained in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track workflow, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Essentially, if there's a power outage, or winter storm forecasted for your area, we'd love to be able to warn our users to prepare ahead of time (via message on the website) with some of our survival essentials, just so they don't get stuck unprepared.
