# indieWIRE: Terms of Service

**_indieWIRE Privacy Statement_**

indieWIRE recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all our subscribers.  We have, instituted, therefore, the following guidelines with a fundamental respect for our user's right to privacy.

 _ **Confidentiality**  
_If you have chosen to receive our free daily e-mail newsletter, we ask for an e-mail address to which you would like indieWIRE sent.  We will only use your e-mail addresses to send indieWIRE editions and special announcements.

All indieWIRE customer-provided information is kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with any outside party.  We do not sell or rent out your e-mail address to marketers.  We will never intentionally disclose individually identifiable information to any third party without your permission.  However, if we are ordered to so disclose such information by a court of proper jurisdiction or some other proper governmental order, we must comply with such an order.

 _ **Use of Information**  
_indieWIRE uses incoming and outgoing web site traffic data without individually identifiable user information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web sites.  We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general.  We may combine demographic information supplied by a user with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences as they relate to indieWIRE.

From time to time, we may agree with third parties to offer other services to indieWIRE readers on an optional basis.  For any such agreements, our partners will only be permitted to contact you or offer you such services or information if you have agreed in advance to be contacted.  They will also be required to disclose their privacy and information use policy to you at all times and you shall always have the right to opt-out of being contacted at your sole discretion.

 _ **Cookies**  
_indieWIRE occasionally uses Cookies to better understand our user's experience on the site and does not share this information with any third party.  You may reset your cookie preference in your internet browser. _ **Unsubscribing**  
_Users may unsubscribe at any time from indieWIRE by sending a blank e-mail from the address that is subscribed, to [unsubscribe@indiewire.com](mailto:unsubscribe@indiewire.com).

We may periodically contact past clients (advertisers and sponsors) via phone, e-mail or postal mail with new information about indieWIRE's products and services.  If you would like to be removed from our past customer list, please send an e-mail to indiewire@indiewire.com and be sure to indicate your company name.

 _ **Links**  
_Remember that indieWIRE.com contains links to other sites, such as indieWIRE partners, advertisers and other content providers.  When you "click" on a link or banner advertisement, you will leave the indieWIRE site and this Privacy and Information Use Policy will no longer be relevant or in effect for those other sites to which you arrive.  Those sites may have privacy and information use policies that differ from indieWIRE's policies, so please check them before submitting any information. _ **Questions**  
_If you have any questions about this privacy statement, indieWIRE practices, or feel that your privacy has been compromised, please contact us at [contact@indiewire.com](mailto:contact@indiewire.com). _ **Changes**  
_We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time at our sole discretion.  We will not make any substantial changes to our policies, however, without notifying you that we have made changes.  Please check this page periodically for changes.
