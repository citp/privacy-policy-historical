Additionally, information collected from a particular browser or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such information was collected.

For information about how to manage your information and the choices you have, see Your Choices below.

## HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS

When you provide information that personally identifies you to the team of volunteers, staff, and contractors who run Indivisible Project, we appreciate the sensitivities that may be associated with that.  We will not share your personally identifiable information with anyone else without your consent except in limited circumstances, as described below. We may, however, share information that does not specifically and personally identify you, such as aggregate information, device identifiers, or other unique identifiers to third parties.  For information about how to manage your information and the choices you have, see Your Choices below.  

Please note, that some of the information you provide, such as when you register groups or create events, is public and your information will be publicly available to others who visit or use the Websites.

Third-Party Service Providers:  We engage third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf such as: hosting, content management, analytics, and fraud protection.  These third parties may have access to your personal information when needed to perform their functions. If we share information with these third parties that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, or phone number, we will require the third parties to maintain the confidentiality and security of your personal information, and they will be restricted from using, selling, or distributing such personally identifiable information in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Websites or as otherwise required or expressly permitted by law.  

Indivisible network groups: We regularly provide supporter and volunteer lists to Invisible network groups (made up of local community volunteers) within the Indivisible network.  The Indivisible network is a nationwide movement of thousands of volunteer-led local groups that engage in a range of progressive efforts ranging from advocacy to electoral work at the local, state, and federal level.  At the national level, Indivisible is supported by three separate entities: Indivisible Civics, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization; Indivisible Project, a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization; and Indivisible Action, a hybrid political action committee. When volunteers and supporters of Indivisible sign up to attend events, participate locally, or receive information from Indivisible, the contact information shared with the national Indivisible organizations may be shared with Indivisible network groups in the relevant locality. For instance, if you sign up to attend an event in your community, we will share your registration information with the local Indivisible network group organizing the event.  Sharing your contact information with Indivisible network groups may be necessary for administrative matters, or to provide you with additional information about local events and related information.  If you prefer that we do not share your name and contact information with Indivisible network groups, please let us know by following the instructions in the opt-out procedures below.  If you have any questions about this type of sharing, please contact us at [**contact@indivisible.org**](mailto:contact@indivisible.org) **.**

Partners: We occasionally exchange or share our supporter lists with carefully selected organizations whose information we believe may be of interest to our supporters.  Sharing your name with other similar organizations or businesses will help us build our supporter base and expand our programs in a cost-effective way. If you prefer that we do not exchange or share your name and contact information, please let us know by following the instructions in the opt-out procedures below.

Mergers and Transfers:  We may change control of our organization, transfer assets, or merge with another entity while providing the Websites.  We may transfer the information we collect and maintain to another entity or its affiliates or service providers in connection with, or during negotiations of, any such change, transfer or merger.  Under such circumstances, we will require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Statement with respect to previously collected information.

Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations:  We may also use or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or on the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or our Websites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Websites or our users, or (c) act to protect the personal safety of us, users of the Websites, or the public.

For example, if you post information to the Websites, we may disclose your information to a third party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if you allege that another user of the Websites is infringing upon your intellectual property rights, we may disclose your information to the alleged infringer.

## How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Like many websites, we use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to record your preferences, and track the use of our Websites.  We may also use these technologies to monitor traffic, and improve the Websites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of the Websites may not work or may not work as designed.

We partner with third-party advertising companies who also use these tracking tools to provide advertisements on our Websites or other websites.  These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Websites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.  They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Websites. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.  While we do not knowingly provide these entities with information that personally identifies you such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.

Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality.  Our information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to visitors, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Statement, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.

## YOUR CHOICES

When you sign up for communications from us, register a group, or register an action, you acknowledge that we may use your e-mail address to communicate with you about our activities and respond to your inquiries, as well as take any other actions associated with your requests. You may unsubscribe from communications by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided in those communications.  Please note that we may still need to retain information previously provided to comply with legal obligations.

Online Tracking Choices:  You also have choices to limit some tracking mechanisms that collect information when you use the Websites.  Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of our Websites, including the Websites themselves, may not function properly or remain accessible to you.  In addition, you may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies.

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., on our Websites. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Websites, compile reports on the Websites’ activity, and provide other services related to Websites activity and usage.  The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Websites do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google click [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

Many of the third party advertisers that place tracking tools on our Websites are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information.  You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx).  You can also learn more about [Facebook’s ad preferences tool](https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892) and [manage your preferences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/settings).

Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Websites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs.  It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

Communications: We send subscribers information about upcoming events in their local region, as well as updates and informational resources as they become available. If you do not wish to receive emails about such events, resources, or other service offerings you may opt-out by clicking the opt-out button at the bottom of the email. We may send you communications via text messages from time to time.  You may opt-in to receive such text messages through our mobile phone program. If you believe you have received and email or text message in error, please email us at [contact@indivisible.org](mailto:contact@indivisible.org).

Periodically you may also receive account related emails that include confirmations of your registration for an event or group, transactional emails related to donations, or other significant notifications related to our service or your participation in activities.  Please note that you may communicate with us via email, but be aware that information disclosed in emails may not be secure or encrypted and as a result may be available to others. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential or sensitive information through email. If you contact us via email, we will use your email address to respond directly to your questions or comments.

## HOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION

We do our best to provide you with a safe and secure experience when you use our website.  Our Websites incorporate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including the use of encryption, firewalls, limited access and other controls where appropriate.   Please understand, however, that while we do our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

You can help protect the privacy of your own information by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized interception of your personal information.  You are responsible for the security of your information that you transmit to us or view, download, or otherwise access when using unencrypted, public or otherwise unsecured networks.
