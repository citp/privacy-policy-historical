Inderscience respects the privacy of its website visitors. We provide the following statement to inform you of our policies and practices regarding how we use the information we gather about you.

By registering or placing an order on this website, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information under the terms of this policy.

**Collection of information**

When you visit, register or order products or services (including newsletters and tables of contents and author submissions) on this website you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself including your name, contact details and, for orders, credit or debit card information.

We also log your domain and IP address automatically when you visit our site; however, this information does not identify you as an individual, but only the computer that you are using to view the site and your approximate geographic location. 

**Use of your information**

Your information will enable us to provide you with access to parts of our website as applicable and to supply the goods or services you have requested. It will also enable us to bill you and to contact you where necessary concerning your orders. We may also use and analyse the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business.

Where we have received opt-in information from you, we may use your information to let you know by email, telephone or post about other products and services we offer which may be of interest to you, along with any important changes or developments to our website or services. If you decide that you do not wish to be contacted about other services in the future, please contact us at [subs@inderscience.com](mailto:subs@inderscience.com) and we'll make sure you're not contacted for these purposes again.

The information you provide to us may be accessed by or given to third parties, some of whom may be located outside the European Economic Area, who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. Those parties process information, fulfil and deliver orders, process credit card payments and provide support services on our behalf.

**Disclosure of information**

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We share your information within Inderscience Enterprises Ltd and affiliates and with suppliers, which assist us in making the website available to you. We may also share your information with licensors as applicable.

**Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us (including your email and postal address) to companies or persons outside Inderscience Enterprises Ltd and affiliates without your consent.**

If any part of our business is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers.

**Security**

Some of your personal information is stored at a data centre managed by our third party hosting company. The data centre managed by our third party hosting company is specifically designed to be physically secure and to admit authorised personnel only, who are contractually bound to keep all of our data confidential.

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area. It may also be processed by staffs operating outside the EEA who work for us, or for one of our suppliers.

**Contact**

If you have any requests in relation to the use we make of your information, please email [subs@inderscience.com](mailto:subs@inderscience.com).

**Cookie policy**

We use cookies to store sessions in order to provide an interactive and personal experience to our website users. We do not use cookies to serve adverts or other promotional materials.

**Third-party cookies**

One of the principal third-party systems involved in our site which uses a cookie is Google Analytics. This cookie is essential for compiling reports on the performance of our website to help us improve the service we provide for our users. It collects information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to our website, where visitors have come from and the pages they have visited. More information on the use of cookies for Google Analytics can be found at [Cookies & Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and [Safeguarding your Google Analytics data](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

We also embed some elements from trusted third parties into our website pages, allowing us to provide you with features integrated with [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) and [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/).

Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through their browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit the [All About Cookies website](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

In many cases these cookies are used to generate identical information to Google Analytics, and indeed they often use Google Analytics. Opting out of Google Analytics will therefore also opt you out of these cookies. To opt out of Google Analytics across all websites visit the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (BETA) page](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

The above information may be subject to change, so we recommend that you return periodically to review our latest privacy and cookie statement.
