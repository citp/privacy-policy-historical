# Yahoo! Web Analytics

Yahoo! Web Analytics is a browser-based system used to collect information about visitors to our customers' websites.

Information Collection and Use

Yahoo! Web Analytics uses [web beacons](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/webbeacons/) and [cookies](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/cookies/) to collect data about visitors to our customer’s websites. This data is sent to Yahoo! by your web browser as part of your interaction with a customer's website. The data collected commonly includes [IP address](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/ip/), time spent on webpages, links clicked, or advertisements viewed on those pages. This data is collected by Yahoo! Web Analytics so that Yahoo! can report statistical information. Yahoo! Web Analytics cookies do not contain personally identifiable information such as name, age, or phone number.

We collect this information on behalf of our customers. Our customers may also provide us with personally identifiable information such as email address to add to the report. We do not share customer reports or any personally identifiable information of users with third parties other than with the customer for whom we have collected this data. We contractually require our customers to post information about data collection and sharing practices with Yahoo! on their websites.

Yahoo! may also use only the browser data collected through Yahoo! Web Analytics in order to improve our products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to users.
