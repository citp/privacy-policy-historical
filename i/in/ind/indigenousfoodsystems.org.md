## Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy for the Indigenous Food Systems Network Website

As stated by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, “Privacy is an essential freedom that shapes our society; an internationally recognized human right; and the foundation of modern democracy.” In recognition of this fact, the Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty is committed to protecting your privacy within the means available to us.

### The information we collect

Anyone can access the resources that are on the Indigenous Food Systems Network website without needing to be a registered user.

However, if you want to upload resources or comment on the resources that are already on the website, you will need to register.

To register, you must provide your name and an active email address. Each Registrant chooses a “Display Name” that will be shown alongside any resources that the Registrant uploads or comments made – this name can be an alias, if so desired.

Once Registered, each member can provide as much or as little personal contact information as she or he wishes.

The website uses “cookies” so that you can be recognized as a genuine member each time you login. However, the information collected by the cookies is only retained for the purpose of enabling your access to and use of the site. It will not be kept nor sold for the purposes of tracking or analyzing your activities.

### What we use the information for

By requiring those who add content to the website, we are able to safeguard against inappropriate material and actions such as spamming of this site.

No member’s email will ever be displayed on the site. The site administrator will have access to members’ emails in case there is ever a need to communicate directly with a member. For example, a Member’s resource may prompt inquiries from others who found the resource useful and would like to collaborate further. We do not, however, anticipate that there will be much call for this as Members can comment on resources directly on the website.
