 _About the website:_  
Indiansex4U.com is an online community of adults sharing personal information about their interests in legal sexual activities. This information is in the form of postings on the community bulletin board of personal pictures, discussions, personal ads and erotic stories. These postings reflect the views of the authors and are not the views of Indiansex4U or Tarrob Web Services.

This website does not allow community postings of any "sexually explicit conduct" as defined in 18 USC § 2256. Simply put, this is a adult website of a soft-core nature.
