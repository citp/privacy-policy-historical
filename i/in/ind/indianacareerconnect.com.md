Personally identifying information is kept in a secure, encrypted database.

Your information allows us to assist you in the following ways:

As a general rule, IndianaCareerConnect does not collect personally identifying information about you when you visit the site unless you choose to provide such information. The information we receive depends upon which web forms you complete when using IndianaCareerConnect.

For basic job opening and career information, you can use IndianaCareerConnect as a "guest" without registering. To apply for positions or create a resumé, however, registration is required.

For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, IndianaCareerConnect employs software programs which monitor network traffic and identify unauthorized use of the site.

Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this site are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
