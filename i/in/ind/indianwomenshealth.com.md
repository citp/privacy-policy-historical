## **On what basis do we use your personal information?**

Data privacy law sets out a number of different reasons on which a company may rely to collect and use your personal information.

We use your personal information for the following reasons:

            * _For legitimate business purposes:_ We use your personal information to make our communications with you more relevant and personalised to you, and to make your experience of our products and services efficient and effective. It also helps us to operate and improve our business and minimise any disruption to the services that we may offer to you.
            * _To perform a contract to which you are a party_ : we may need to process your personal information to provide a product or service you request.
            * _To comply with our legal obligations and other demands for information:_ It is important to us that we are able to comply with laws, regulations and guidance, as well as the other requests or demands for data as set out here. They affect the way in which we run our business and help us to make our products and services as safe as we can.
            * _You have given your consent:_ At times we may need to get your consent to allow us to use your personal information for one or more of the purposes set out above. See the “Your rights regarding your personal information” section for information about the rights that you have if we process your information on the basis of your consent.



## How long will we keep your personal information?

We will always keep your personal information for the period required by law and where we need to do so in connection with legal action or an investigation involving GSK. Otherwise, we keep your personal information:

            * for as long as needed to provide you with access to services you have requested;
            * where you have contacted us with a question or request, for as long as necessary to allow us to respond your question or request.



## **We sometimes share your personal information with others and transfer it internationally**

We may share your personal information with:

            * members of the GSK group of companies; and
            * the following trusted third parties:
            * our agents and suppliers, including those who provide us with technology services such as data analytics, hosting and technical support;
            * our professional advisors, auditors and business partners;
            * regulators, governments and law enforcement authorities; and
            * other third parties in connection with re-organising all or any part of our business.



Your personal information may be processed by GSK, its affiliated companies and GSK’s trusted third party suppliers outside of your home country. Data privacy laws in the countries to which your personal information is transferred may not be equivalent to, or as protective as, the laws in your home country. 

We will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure when it is transferred outside of your home country, in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.  These measures include data transfer agreements implementing standard data protection clauses, or GSK’s Binding Corporate Rules.  You can find more information about data transfer agreements [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en), and more information about [GSK’s Binding Corporate Rules](https://web.archive.org/en-gb/about-us/policies-codes-and-standards/binding-corporate-rules/ "Binding Corporate Rules") _._

## Protecting your personal information

We use a variety of security measures and technologies to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction in line with applicable data protection and privacy laws. For example, when we share your personal information with external suppliers, we may put in place a written agreement which commits the suppliers to keep your information confidential, and to put in place appropriate security measures to keep your information secure.

The transmission to us of information via the internet or a mobile phone network connection may not be completely secure and any transmission is at your own risk.

## **Websites** **that we do not own or control**

From time to time we may provide links to websites or mobile applications that are not owned or controlled by us. This Privacy Notice does not apply to those websites. If you choose to use those websites, please check the legal and privacy statements posted on each website or mobile application you access to understand their privacy practices.

## **Your rights** **regarding your personal information**

Data privacy laws provide you with a number of rights over your personal information. 

You may be entitled to:

            * ask GSK for access to the personal information GSK holds about you;
            * request the correction and/or deletion of your personal information;
            * request the restriction of the processing of your personal information, or object to that processing;
