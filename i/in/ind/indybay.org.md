### Privacy Policy

The SF Bay Area IMC intends to give you the user as much control as possible over your personal information. We will let each user know how we will use the personal information derived from each user's access to and use of the web site services.

#### NOTICE

The SF Bay Area IMC web server does not normally track the domains or IP addresses from which people visit and/or post to the SF Bay Area Indymedia web site. Usage of other services, however, may be logged.

Due to repeated denial-of-service (DOS)/spam attacks conducted against the SF Bay Area Indymedia website, SF Bay Area IMC may at times log all webserver activity, including client IP addresses. Any such logs will be stored on a RAM disk and discarded within 24 to 48 hours. SF Bay Area IMC reserves the right to send reports of DOS/spam activity to the spammer's internet service provider, and to post them publicly on its website. Only log entries pertaining directly to clear cases of website abuse will be so disseminated and/or preserved.

The SF Bay Area IMC web site contains links to other websites, whether controlled by Indymedia affiliates or unrelated third parties. The SF Bay Area IMC is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any linked website.

Currently, the SF Bay Area IMC uses personal information as a basis for identifying the authors of published articles, and in order to allow individual user login to certain site functions, including ratings and admin. Names (and additional information that a user may choose to post) are publicly available on the SF Bay Area IMC site.

All e-mail sent to the SF Bay Area IMC is stored and accessible to members of Indybay's private email list, including the sender's reported name and e-mail address.

At no time, unless a user specifically authorizes such disclosure, will the SF Bay Area IMC disclose individual user personal information that is not publicly available to unrelated third parties.

The SF Bay Area IMC e-mail lists, hosted at lists.riseup.net, are configured such that all text messages sent to the list, along with names and e-mail addresses, are disclosed in the message archive. In addition, a complete list of subscribers may be available to third parties at the lists web site, although users can opt to conceal themselves from the subscriber list. Users concerned with privacy issues are encouraged to sign up for an anonymous e-mail service.

#### ACCESS

While such updating service is not technically feasible, the SF Bay Area IMC will make reasonable efforts to assist users in updating their personal information.
