## Limited information gathering

Like most commercial web sites, InkTechnologies.com uses cookies so we can better serve you with tailored information. Cookies are small text identifiers sent to your computer to facilitate optimal customer experience and subsequent visits. Most browsers let you define preferences to notify you when you are sent cookies and let you decide whether to accept or reject them. Virtually all browsers let you remove cookies from your computer.

Cookies cannot retrieve information from your computer, spread viruses, or capture your email address. Ink Technologies uses cookies responsibly; our cookies are never spyware; nor are they used in any malicious manner. We, specifically, use them to assist in our Google remarketing ad campaign to display relevant ads across the Internet and when you return to InkTechnologies.com - when you create an account and log-in, to maintain a shopping session.

As of October, 2012, InkTechnologies is using the ClickTale web analytics service. ClickTale may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as text you type in this website. InkTechnologies does not use ClickTale to collect any personally identifiable information entered on our website. ClickTale does not track your browsing habits across web sites that do not use ClickTale services. For more information see [Privacy Policy for Information Collected by the ClickTale Web Analytics Service](http://www.clicktale.com/privacy_service.aspx). We are using the information collected by ClickTale service to improve our customer experience and better understand how our customers interact with our services.

You can choose to disable the Service at <http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html>.

## Advertising

Ink Technologies does not sell or distribute any personal identifying information about your shopping experience without expressed consent on the part of the user. We do not serve any advertisements for other products or companies, from our site; nor will we contact you on behalf of any other company. We participate in Google's trusted remarketing program, which helps target ads, across the Internet, to your relevant shopping interests.

If you do not feel comfortable being part of Google's remarketing program, you can opt out of Google's 'use of cookies' by visiting their [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/). Alternatively, you can opt out of any third-party vendor's 'use of cookies' by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
