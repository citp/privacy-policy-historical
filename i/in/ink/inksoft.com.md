What InkSoft does with this information:

The information InkSoft collects is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve the content of our website, used to notify consumers about updates to our website or used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
