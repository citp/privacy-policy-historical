### 3\. Uses Made of the Information.

We use the Information held about you to deliver services to you in the most effective manner and to carry out all obligations arising as a result of the provision of the services such as billing, upgrades and account maintenance.

### 4\. Limited Circumstances where we are required to Disclose your Information.

4.1 In general, except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any of your Information to any unaffiliated third parties without your express consent or allowing you to decline to permit the disclosure. There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose Information about a user without express consent, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:

4.1.1 Forth Metrics Vendors: We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending print and electronic mail, or other functions necessary to our business. In order to allow these companies to fulfill their obligations, we may need to share your Information with them. However, we will provide these companies with only that Information necessary to perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your Information for any other purpose.

4.1.2 Protection of Rights: We may reveal your Information to lawyers or law enforcement officials if we believe that you have harmed or interfered (or will imminently harm or interfere) with other users of our websites or anyone else or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and Conditions of Use or infringing any of Forth Metrics’ legal rights, or harming the legal rights, property, or health or safety of any other person.

4.1.3 Required by Law: Forth Metrics will reveal your Information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your Information, we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable period of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted.

4.1.4 Asset Transfer: We shall be entitled to transfer the Information to a third party in connection with a transaction involving a transfer of some or all of the business and assets relating to the websites and/or services or a business in connection with which such Information is maintained.

### 5\. Security of Your Information.

5.1 Our employees are required to protect the confidentiality of your Information and to comply with our established policies. Authorised employees may only access Information in order to fulfill their given duties. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information which comply with all applicable laws.

5.2 Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorised disclosure of your Information. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing your Information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that your Information will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorised access.

### 6\. Where we Store the Information.

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Forth Metrics will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### 7\. Your Rights.

You have the right to request a copy of personal information we hold about you. To do this, simply write to us or send us an email – you’ll find our contact details here. We may charge you £10 for providing this information to cover our administration costs. You may unsubscribe from our email newsletter at any time by emailing or writing to us. To provide the highest level of customer service we need accurate customer information. You can help by informing us whenever your circumstances change. You can ask us to correct incorrect personal information about you by writing to or emailing us. You can find detailed information about your rights under UK Data Protection legislation on the UK Information Commissioner’s website at [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/).

### 8\. Our Right to Modify or Change this Privacy Policy.

Forth Metrics reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, or to terminate this Privacy Policy. We will post notice of the new policy using the Privacy Policy links on our websites. Your use of our websites following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed.
