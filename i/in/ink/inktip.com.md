# Scripts, Writers, Producers - InkTip.com - Confidential

InkTip believes that strong electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of our service. 

The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for InkTip. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

All industry professional registrations are manually reviewed to ensure that our writers' scripts/books are protected. This review and validation process is done prior to allowing access to any script/book download area. 

All uploads and downloads of synopses, treatments, and scripts are logged by InkTip. Additionally, notice of download is provided to the script/book owner and his/her representative (if applicable), along with the contact information of the member who did the download. 

If any member experiences problems in data transfer of scripts, please [contact us](mailto:jerrol@inktip.com) at once via email.

**Passwords and User IDs**

New members create their own user IDs and passwords at the time of registration. Members are strongly encouraged to not make these codes available to other individuals. InkTip performs random verification of industry professionals who access our site. To protect our writers, all log-ins are recorded; any security problem will include a prompt investigation into the log in information we maintain on site. 

Members are also encouraged to change their password regularly so as to promote a more secure environment for all.

**Cookies**

Websites use what are called "cookies" to store member names and passwords. Cookies allow us to both store and retrieve login information through a user's browser. 

A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. 

InkTip uses cookies to transfer user ID information from one page to the next within our site, and for validation of user ID in protecting certain pages from being viewed. Our cookies last only for the length of time the member is logged into InkTip.

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (name and email address). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company as well as information regarding available scripts and other script-acquisition related data. The member's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. 

The contact information writers provide allows industry professional members to contact them regarding scripts they may be interested in. If a writer is represented, the contact information they provide about their representative is used in place of the writer's contact information. In the case of a represented writer, personal contact information is not published on site. InkTip may contact any member as necessary.

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the opt-out section below. 

This site contains links to other sites. InkTip is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

**Shopping Cart**

Our site uses an order form and shopping cart for members to purchase uploads of scripts to our server. We collect visitors' contact information (email address), unique identifiers (specifically their user ID and password), and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). 

Financial information that is collected is used to bill the member for placing their script and descriptions with InkTip. Unique identifiers (such as user ID's and passwords) are collected from website visitors to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. InkTip does not store financial information for later use.

Contact information from the order form is used to update the member's account and permit uploading of scripts and their descriptions.

The member's contact information is also used to get in touch with the member when necessary.   
Members may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

**Choice/Opt Out**

InkTip periodically sends our members electronic information we believe to be of value, including a free weekly e-newsletter. If a member wishes to opt-out of receiving such information, instructions will be provided on every newsletter for simple removal from our list. 

To discontinue receiving future communications or to no longer receive our service, please [unsubscribe here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012322id_/http%3A//www.inktip.com/newsletter.php), or [send an email](mailto:jerrol@inktip.com) with the subject 'Opt Out.'

InkTip does not give out, sell, broker or otherwise distribute mailing lists, contact information or personal demographics information to third party companies or non-members. 

**Correct/Update**

This site allows users to update and modify information previously provided, such as resume data and member contact information. Members who have placed scripts with InkTip may also update information pertaining to their scripts, such as synopses, treatments, scripts/books and script/book descriptions.
