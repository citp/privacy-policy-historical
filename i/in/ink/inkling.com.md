For example, our business users may provide us with the names and email addresses of their employees or other agents who are authorized to access the Service, as well as other information about such employees or agents.

#### Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Service. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).

**_Cookies._**  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Service, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process, to allow us to track your activities on our Service, or to otherwise enable Service features. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the site, but some features may not function.

**_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies._**  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our site to, among other things, track the activities of site visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.

**_LSOs._** We or third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features of the Service or to display advertising based upon your tracked activity may use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) using technologies such as HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To learn about managing Flash LSOs, please click [here](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

**_Third-party Analytics._**  We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze collected information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors’ needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.

#### California Do Not Track Disclosure

**_Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests._**  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling cookies). For more information about tracking, please click [here](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

#### Interest-Based Advertising

We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g. social networking platforms). For example, we use LinkedIn, Microsoft AdCenter, and Google Ad Words to serve advertisements on third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including Personal Information, about you.

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by NAI members.

Users in the European Union may also opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) [Your Online Choices Page](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by [EDAA members](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), the [NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the EDAA [Your Online Choices Page](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, or EDAA-related websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/), the NAI’s website at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/), and the EDAA’s website at [www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice).
