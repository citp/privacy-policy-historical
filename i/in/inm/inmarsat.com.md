# Privacy Note

**Inmarsat Global Limited**  
 **Privacy practices on the web**

Your privacy is important to Inmarsat. This privacy statement discloses the personal information practices for the Inmarsat Gloabl Limited website. 

In general, you can visit our website home page and browse our site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. 

If you have an enquiry or require information from Inmarsat, you may choose to give us personal data, such as your name and contact details, to enable us to correspond with you in this regard. To enable us to respond to your enquiry, your details will need to be shared with Inmarsat Partners, those companies and organisations that are recognised by Inmarsat as distributors of its services and solutions. This may mean that your information is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area. 

When we collect personal data from you in connection with an enquiry, we may extract some information about that query in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information for marketing and advertising purposes. This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us to understand trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. 

When we collect personal data from you in connection with an enquiry, we will ask you for your consent to allow us to hold these contact details on a database for marketing-related purposes and for the provision of offers of related services which we believe may be of interest to you. 

We will only use your personal information in a way that is fair (with reference to the purposes which are either disclosed to you or are relevant to the reason for your giving us the information). 

Inmarsat Global Limited is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data.
