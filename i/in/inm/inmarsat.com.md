# Privacy policy - Inmarsat

## Information we may collect from you

In general, you can visit our website home page and browse our site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself.

If you have an enquiry or require information from Inmarsat, you may choose to give us personal information, such as your name and contact details, to enable us to correspond with you in this regard.

To enable us to respond to your enquiry, your details may need to be shared with Inmarsat Partners, those companies and organisations that are recognised by Inmarsat as distributors of its services and solutions. This may mean that your information is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area.

When we collect personal information from you in connection with an enquiry, we may extract some information about that query in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information for marketing and advertising purposes. This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us to understand trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level.

When we collect personal information from you in connection with an enquiry, we will ask you for your consent to allow us to hold these contact details on a database for marketing-related purposes and for the provision of offers of related services which we believe may be of interest to you.

We may retain details of your visits to our website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, web logs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own specified purposes or otherwise, and the resources that you access.

We will only use your personal information in a way that is fair (with reference to the purposes which are either disclosed to you or are relevant to the reason for your giving us the information).

### IP addresses and cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:

  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
  * To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests.
  * To speed up your searches.
  * To recognise you when you return to our site.



You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

### Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information you provide to us is stored on our servers which are security protected. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### Disclosure of your information

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate parent undertaking, Inmarsat plc, and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
  * If the Inmarsat group of companies or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Inmarsat Global Limited, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



### Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting the Company Secretary.

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

### Changes to our privacy policy

Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page.
