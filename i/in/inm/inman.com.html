<p><b>When did foreclosure relief become my problem?</b></p>

<p>Re: '<a href="http://www.inman.com/InmanNews.aspx?ID=65442" target="blank">Foreclosure relief plan draws mixed industry response</a>' (Dec. 6)</p>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>

<p>I love and hate reading articles like this, and it's all  about the content. If the government is not putting any money into the process,  that means we're all paying for it. Granted, the people who we're bailing out  are paying for it as well, but here's my question:</p>
<p>When did this become my problem?</p>
<p>I could have jumped on the bandwagon during the refi boom,  but my income does not allow me to in the area I live … but I accepted that as  fact and kept working hard. It would appear that too many people, be it  ignorant, deceived, dumb or unwilling to accept their status as what it was,  chose to ignore reason and logic and participate in a gamble. The gamble was  incredibly risky, and we were all aware of that at the time. Still, many people  chose to roll the dice and take their chances.</p>
<p>They lost.</p>
<p>Now, here the economy is starting to seriously suffer  because, essentially, a bunch of people took all their money to Vegas and lost  it, and now they cannot buy what they need, and they want us to step in and  help them. The government is speaking on 'our' behalf, and passing the buck,  Bush-style, while taking credit for affecting a solution. I fail to see why a  solution is required here … these people will run out of cash, they will lose  their houses, and they will be back to a similar situation as they were in  before they decided to risk everything on a gamble.</p>
<p>My fiancé has always told me to take to Vegas only what you  can afford to lose, and I simply would never consider taking my house there.  Let the problem work itself out, and if the mucky-mucks that are watching the  Stock Market like vultures awaiting a kill want to complain, let them do so. It's  nice to hear them complaining that they're not earning enough money this month …  makes me feel like I did some good by just sitting here.</p>

<p>Re: '<a href="http://www.inman.com/inmannews.aspx?ID=65451" target="blank">Thanks for the referral</a>' (Dec. 7)</p>
<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p>Comments: This is a great reminder that TIMING plays a more  important role in our careers and everyday lives than we might imagine. A  timely "thank you" packs a more powerful punch every time.</p>
<p>On that note, I'd like to remind clients to pass on a  "thank you" to their hard-working agent as well. There's a lot of  work that takes place behind the scenes to locate an appropriate home, present  a persuasive offer, and follow it through to closing.</p>
<p>I've never been a real estate agent, but when I worked in  the mortgage industry I observed how hard agents work. They most certainly  deserve appreciation!</p>
