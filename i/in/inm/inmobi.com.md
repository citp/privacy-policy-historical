## Privacy Policy

### LAST UPDATED: 24 FEBRUARY 2017

### EFFECTIVE: 27 MARCH 2017

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

InMobi is committed to respecting and protecting individuals' privacy rights. This Privacy Policy explains how InMobi Pte Ltd, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "InMobi" or "we", "us", "our") collect, use, secure, and/or disclose end users’ (“you” or “your”) device-related information when (i) you view ads served by InMobi on third party websites or mobile apps (see the section below called "InMobi Ad Network"), and (ii) you visit the InMobi website at [ www.inmobi.com ](http://www.inmobi.com/) (see section below called "InMobi Website").

Any content aggregation services or feature (such as displaying of stories, articles, pictures, blogs etc.) (whether through an app or other software integration) provided by InMobi on a device will not be covered under this Privacy Policy, except to the extent the app or software promotes any interest based advertising by InMobi. We urge you to refer the privacy policy of such services separately, as and when made available.

### 2\. INMOBI ADVERTISING

2.1 WHAT IS THE INMOBI AD NETWORK?

InMobi is a global ad network with a suite of ad tech products. We partner with third-party mobile website publishers and mobile app developers to serve ads on their sites and in their apps, and InMobi may also serve ads on the site and mobile applications that InMobi owns. These ads may be customised to their users' interests and geographic locations, which we may derive or infer from information that we collect about how those users interact with such sites and apps (this type of advertising is often called "interest-based advertising" or "targeted advertising"). This enables our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to their users, often using the advertising revenues they generate to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost. Further, we may also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and/or advertisers’ partners for optimising digital advertising and/or analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and reporting. Please note that collection, use or storage of such data is governed by the privacy policy of such third party partners and/or advertisers providing the same.

InMobi may engage in cross-device data collection, which refers to the process of collecting data from devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related. We, or third parties whom we engage to provide this service, may use cross-device data to provide interest-based advertising services and to deliver tailored ads to users across multiple devices.

### 

2.2 WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

When you view an InMobi ad on a site or app, we may collect information about your device that you have viewed. This information enables us to improve our services including to recognise your device when you use other sites and apps that have partnered with us.

(a) Information about your device 

InMobi may collect some or all of the following information about your device: device type (e.g. smartphone, tablet, etc.),operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry), network provider, mobile browser used (e.g. Safari, Internet Explorer etc.),platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, iOS Identifier for Advertising, iOS Identifier for Vendors, model, manufacture of device, OS version of device, session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, network status such as WiFi, the geo-location of your device (using GPS or other geo-location data) and the Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or the Google Advertising ID (AAID) etc. In some countries, we also collect information such as international mobile equipment identity (IMEI), Internet (IP) addresses or geo-location data, which may be considered to be personal information and in which case, we ensure compliance with applicable laws in our collection or use of the same, to the extent applicable in such jurisdictions.

InMobi may collect the geo-location of your device only when an app or site, which leverages InMobi’s offerings through integration of InMobi’s technology/software (whether SDK, API or other integration) is active on the device. One way InMobi derives a device’s location is by collecting the device’s latitude and longitude coordinates through GPS. InMobi may infer the geo location of a device based on data collected through a WiFi identifier that the device is connected to, subject to country specific laws and/or industry guidelines related to such collection or inference practices. e.g: In the U.S. and UK, InMobi may infer geo-location through WiFi identifiers pursuant to obtaining user consent through applicable apps or sites.

(b) Information about ads presented on your device

InMobi also collects some or all of the following information about an ad presented on your device: (i) the content type of the ad (what the ad is about, e.g. games, finance, entertainment, news); (ii) the ad type (e.g. whether the ad is a text, image, or video based ad); (iii) where the ad is being served (e.g. the address of the site on which the ad appears); and (iv) certain information about post-click activity in relation to the ad including user interaction with such ad.

On occasion, our partnering mobile publishers or app developers may also disclose to us certain information including email addresses of users in a hashed format (not in raw format) they have separately collected about you so that we can improve the relevance of the ads we serve on their behalf. They do this in accordance with their own specific privacy policies and subject to their own applicable legal requirements. We do not use the information they provide to us for any purpose other than serving you with interest-based ads or for reporting or analytical purpose(s).

2.3 HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?

InMobi uses the information that we collect from your device to display advertising on your device, which may include interest-based advertising customised to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences and locations and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services.

The information we collect from your device also helps us to provide filtering options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for advertisers. This helps our publishers and developer clients, for example, to avoid presenting you ads that you have already seen, and helps our advertiser clients serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you.

2.4 WHO DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH?

(a) Publishers, Developers, Advertisers, Data Partners and Measurement Companies 

InMobi may share the information we collect or receive regarding you as described in this Policy with our publishers, developers, data partners, measurement companies and advertisers. These partners may use this information to show you relevant ads, measure your ad/site interaction, identify your interest areas, better understand the site and app traffic usage or user behaviour in order to refine and improve their services. Such partners’ use of the information we share with them will be governed by their privacy policies.

(b) With InMobi Affiliates

We may also share your information with InMobi affiliates so that we can better provide advertising that is relevant to you.

(c) Sharing Info with third parties such as advisors and law enforcement authorities

From time to time, we may also need to disclose your information to other third parties, such as law enforcement authorities or our legal advisers, where it is necessary to: comply with the law or regulations; enforce or apply our user terms and conditions; protect our rights, or; preserve the safety of our users. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

InMobi may also share your information in connection with any merger, a sale of InMobi assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

2.5 HOW DO WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE?

InMobi uses reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect the information it collects about you and your device. We may anonymise the information we collect using one-way hashing technology before sharing it with any third parties. We also seek appropriate contractual protection from our partners regarding their treatment of user data.

2.6 HOW LONG DO WE KEEP INFORMATION FOR?

InMobi may retain the information relating to your device collected from partnering mobile publishers or app developers for a period of up to thirteen (13) months, unless otherwise required by law or applicable contract. After the 13-month period, InMobi may retain and use such data in an aggregated format, as necessary for internal analytical purposes, to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements.

2.7 OPTING OUT OF INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING

If you prefer not to receive interest-based advertising from InMobi, you can opt out of interest-based advertising at any time by going to the InMobi [Opt Out](http://www.inmobi.com/page/opt-out/) page and submitting your device ID.
