## VII. DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY

PMN has put in place reasonable measures to protect the Site from being accessed by unauthorized third parties, and to preserve the information collected, gathered, stored on the Site, and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Despite those efforts, we cannot guarantee that an unauthorized third party will not access that information, resulting in the disclosure of such information in a manner that is not authorized by this Privacy Policy. 

## VIII. MINIMIZATION, RETENTION, AND DELETION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including, for example, for so long as we provide you with Services, and for the purposes of satisfying any legal (including but not limited to enforcement of agreements or resolving disputes), accounting, or reporting requirements. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you with Services, contact [DigitalSupport@philly.com](mailto:DigitalSupport@philly.com). 

In some circumstance. Even after we no longer retain your Personal Information, we may anonymize your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research, statistical or other purposes in which case we may retain and use that information indefinitely without further notice to you. 

## IX. ACCEPTANCE AND CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, consistent with the applicable data protection and privacy laws and principles. We will make you aware of changes to this Privacy Policy either by posting to our Digital Properties and/or Services, through email, or other means. We will post those changes on our websites and in our apps so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. We will also notify you by email or a means of a notice on our websites and apps prior to the changes becoming effective, if we make changes that materially affect the way we handle Personal Information. If you do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Privacy Policy, you will need to deactivate with us and stop using our Digital Properties and Services. Your use of our Digital Properties and Services after the posting of changes to our privacy policy will constitute your consent to such changes. By using Philadelphia Media Network’s Services and our Digital Properties, and/or submitting any of your Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
