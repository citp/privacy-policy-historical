  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
  

  


### Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where:

  


  

  * We have your consent to do so
  

  * We need the personal information to perform a contract with you
  

  * The processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights or
  

  * We have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you
  



"Legitimate interests" means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/products and the best and most secure experience. For example: we have an interest in keeping our network secure. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well. For example: we may process your Personal Information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website. We process Personal Information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following:

  


  

  * To enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services/communications for the benefit of our customers
  

  * To identify and prevent fraud
  

  * To enhance the security of our network and information systems
  



When processing your Personal Information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights under the data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests “ we will not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted by law). If you have any concerns about the processing, you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more information on your rights, please see "Your Rights" section below.

  


### Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to us. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of PaperStreet's Websites, but you will be unable to purchase a product or service online, setup an account with us and/or use any of our other paid Services. If you choose to have a relationship with us, such as a contractual or other business relationship, you will be required to provide Personal Information in connection with such relationship.

  


### Accountability for Onward Transfer

When we transfer Personal Information to a third party we will ensure that our agreement with the third party provides that such Personal Information may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent you provided and that the third party will provide the expected level of protection as required by relevant law.

  


### Security

We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the Personal Information that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. PaperStreet utilizes HTTP Secure (HTTPS) and/or Transport Layer Security (TLS) when receiving and transmitting information electronically.  
We protect Personal Information by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.  
Nonetheless, visitors and subscribers should consider all Personal Information, communications, and information provided to PaperStreet to be non-confidential, and consequently, we assume no responsibility or liability if any information relating to any visitor or subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.

  


### International transfers

If you are visiting our Website or using our Services from outside the United States (US), including in the European Economic Area, please be aware that your personal information will be transferred to the US, stored on US servers and potentially processed in other countries whose data protection laws may not be as protective as those in your country of residence. However, our collection, storage and use of your personal information will at all times be in accordance with this privacy policy wherever it is processed.

  


### Data Integrity & Purpose Limitation

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information that we collect is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use and purpose which may include those that reasonably serve payment processing, customer relations, compliance and legal considerations, auditing, security and fraud prevention, preserving or defending our legal rights or other reasonable uses in this context.  
You may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to compliance@psmhelp.com and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable. We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as it is necessary for purposes as identified above.

Upon meeting certain security measures, PaperStreet shall provide you with a copy of the Personal Information that it keeps about you. Prior to completing your request, PaperStreet may require that you provide us with certain items as a proof of your identity. PaperStreet reserves the right to refuse a request where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or where the rights of persons other than You would be violated.

  * We may use automated decision making in processing your Personal Information for some services and products. You can request a manual review of the accuracy of an automated decision if you are unhappy with it.
