The combined data is used to provide, monitor and assist in improvements to the Services and the Innovid Website, and to customize content displayed to you on the Innovid Website.

Anonymous Data, Account Data, Registration Data, and combined data collected from the Innovid Website is not sold or rented to third parties. In addition, such information is not shared with third parties except in the case of third party service providers, legal processes and aggregate information, as noted below.

##  Cookies

Innovid may collect the Non-PII noted in this privacy policy using cookies, which are small text files stored on the visitor’s computer. Visitors can set their browser to reject cookies altogether, to reject Innovid's cookies in particular, or to delete cookies. An End User of the Services may opt-out of interest-based advertising from Innovid; please refer to the Section entitled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising” below.

##  Innovid’s Services

Innovid partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to visitors of third party websites and other online media (such visitors are referred to as “ **End Users** ”).

As an End User browses the Internet, he or she may visit Web pages or other online media that make use of the Services. When this happens, an End User’s browser or device may request advertisements from Innovid's system, and Innovid may collect Non-PII about this interaction, as well as about any further interaction by such End User with the advertisements provided by the Services and the pages or media on which such Services are utilized, such as impressions, clicks, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other Non-PII made available by the browser or device. On occasion, Innovid may also receive from third parties Non-PII that enables advertisement optimization, independent of or in combination with the Non-PII collected by Innovid, such as audience interest segments and product categories.

The Non-PII collected by Innovid and/or received from third parties may be used to provide aggregate reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Services, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Services and perform internal analysis, and to help Innovid display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users. However, Innovid does not target advertisements based on audience interest in medical conditions, health, beauty or fitness.

From time to time, advertisements served by Innovid may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter Personally Identifiable Information into such advertisements or into the landing page to which such advertisements are linked, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding a product or service offered by an advertiser. In the event that an End User elects to provide Personally Identifiable Information under such circumstances, Innovid may collect the Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of such advertiser. Innovid may share such information with the advertiser or with such advertiser’s agency, and will not use such information for any other purpose.  The End User should review the advertiser’s privacy policy to understand how the advertiser will process the PII entered by the End User.

###  Industry Self-Regulation

Innovid is a member of the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct.

###  Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising

End Users can opt out of interest-based advertising served by Innovid. Click here to opt-out, or opt-out through the NAI page located [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). In order to comply with an opt-out request, Innovid may set a non-unique cookie for the sole purpose ensuring that such End User is no longer tracked individually. If an End User deletes its cookies or changes computers or devices after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by clicking the link in this paragraph. End Users also have the option, at any time, to set their browser to not accept cookies from Innovid. Following an opt-out, Innovid's system will still provide advertisements to the End User. Please note, however, that these advertisements may be less relevant to such End User's interests.

Innovid may share information with these third party service providers, but only to the extent necessary to perform such functions and services, and only pursuant to obligations on such third party service providers that are consistent with this Policy.

##  Business Transfers
