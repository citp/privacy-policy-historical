#### Cookies

Innovid may collect the data, including personal data, using cookies, which are small text files stored on the visitor’s computer. Visitors can set their browser to reject cookies altogether, to reject Innovid’s cookies in particular, or to delete cookies. For our EU based website visitors, we may also put in place a Cookie Control Tool on our site. Visitors to third party websites, mobile websites, mobile applications, CTVs and other online media that utilize Innovid’s services may opt-out of interest-based advertising from Innovid; please refer to the Section entitled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising” below.  


#### Innovid’s Services

Innovid partners with numerous companies to provide and measure online advertisements to visitors of third party websites, mobile websites, mobile applications and other online media. Online media also includes televisions with third party connected applications, smart televisions and/or digital media streaming devices (together, “ **CTVs** “). Visitors to third party websites, mobile websites, mobile applications, CTVs and other online media are referred to as **“End Users”**.

As an End User browses the Internet or uses a CTV, he or she may visit web pages, mobile applications, CTV channels or applications, or other online media that make use of the Services. When this happens, an End User’s browser, device, or CTV may request advertisements from Innovid’s system, and Innovid may collect data about this interaction, as well as about any further interaction by such End User with the advertisements provided by the Services and the pages or media on which such Services are utilized, such as impressions, clicks, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other Non-PII made available by the browser or device. In addition, in the event that the data being collected is from a mobile device, Innovid may also collect the mobile advertising ID of the device (e.g. IDFA and Google AdID), and in the event that the data being collected is from a CTV, Innovid may also collect the advertising identifiers made available by the CTV. On occasion, Innovid may also receive from third parties personal data that enables advertisement optimization, independent of or in combination with the data collected by Innovid, such as audience interest segments and product categories.

The data collected by Innovid and/or received from third parties may be shared and used to provide information and reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Services, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Services and perform internal analysis, and to help Innovid display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users. Innovid may use certain general health-related segments received from third parties in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in such topics, such as general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, beauty and fitness. Such health-related segments do not include sensitive health information (such as an End User having a certain medical condition like heart disease or arthritis).

From time to time, advertisements served by Innovid may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter personal data into such advertisements or into the landing page to which such advertisements are linked, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding an advertiser or publisher’s product, service, program or other offer. In the event that an End User elects to provide personal data under such circumstances, Innovid may store such information and may share it with the advertiser, agency or publisher on behalf of whom the advertisement was served, and/or with such entity’s service provider. Innovid may use such information to fulfill or aid in the fulfillment of the End User’s request and/or to auto-populate future requests by the End User’s device. In cases where the advertisement contains functionality enabling Innovid to store personal data, the End User will have the option to opt-out of the storage of such information by indicating its preference in the appropriate checkbox shown in the advertisement, or by clicking through to the settings available through the advertisement. The End User should review the advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy to understand how such entity will process any personal data entered by the End User or captured. If you would like Innovid to delete all records of your personal data, or exercise your rights of access, rectification, portability, or have any other questions or requests with respect to privacy, please send us an email at _[privacy@innovid.com.](mailto:privacy@innovid.com)_

Innovid collects personal data based on several bases, depending on the exact circumstances. Registration Data and Account Data is processed on the basis of a contract between Innovid and the customer; we are not able to provide services and meet the terms of our customer agreements without such processing. Personal data may also be processed on the basis of the legitimate interest Innovid has in serving and measuring advertising, and analyzing, improving, optimizing and personalizing its users’ experience.

To opt-out of any of the processing described in this policy, you may contact Innovid and its Data Protection Officer at privacy@innovid.com. Data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (the UK ICO).  


#### Cross-Device Tracking

Innovid may, or may use the services of third party companies to, establish connections between a user’s devices and to provide interest-based advertising across devices. Cross-device connections allow Innovid to understand that a single user is accessing advertisements served or measured by Innovid from multiple devices and to synchronize or target advertising messages and/or measure the performance of advertisements across those devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit the NAI Choices page located at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android (see <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>), or visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices page located at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice>, to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.
