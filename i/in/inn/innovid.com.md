If you register to use the Innovid Website as a customer of the Services (e.g., as an agency, advertiser or publisher customer), Innovid may request and store Personally Identifying Information you provide, such as your name, email address, company name, username, telephone number and address (collectively, “Registration Data”).

**Google Analytics**

Innovid uses Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, to help analyze how users use the Innovid website and user interface. Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on a user's computer or device, to track the user's activity (including information such as the user's flow, location by country, language, browser and OS, ISP and devices) on the Innovid website and user interface. We use this service with a view to analyzing usage across devices and offering improvements for all users. Google Analytics does not provide Innovid with any PII, and Innovid does not upload any PII or data that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset) to Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics, please click here. To opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, please click here. 

**Intercom**

For customer management purposes, we provide a limited amount of information about users of the Innovid website and user interface (such as the user's email address and sign-up date) to Intercom, Inc., 98 Battery Street, Suite 402, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA (“Intercom”). We utilize Intercom for additional data analysis, e.g. retrieving a user’s sign-up date or activity when providing customer support. We may also use Intercom as a medium for communications, either through email, or through messages within our product. To help us understand our user base, Intercom collects publicly available information, such as a user’s company, job title, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses.

### 

Cookies

Innovid may collect the Non-PII noted in this privacy policy using cookies, which are small text files stored on the visitor’s computer. Visitors can set their browser to reject cookies altogether, to reject Innovid's cookies in particular, or to delete cookies. An End User of the Services may opt-out of interest-based advertising from Innovid; please refer to the Section entitled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising” below. 

### 

Innovid's Services

Innovid partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to visitors of third party websites and other online media (such visitors are referred to as **“End Users”** ).

As an End User browses the Internet, he or she may visit Web pages, mobile applications or other online media that make use of the Services. When this happens, an End User’s browser or device may request advertisements from Innovid's system, and Innovid may collect Non-PII about this interaction, as well as about any further interaction by such End User with the advertisements provided by the Services and the pages or media on which such Services are utilized, such as impressions, clicks, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other Non-PII made available by the browser or device. In addition, in the event that the data being collected is from a mobile device, Innovid may also collect the mobile advertising ID of the device (e.g. IDFA and Google AdID). On occasion, Innovid may also receive from third parties Non-PII that enables advertisement optimization, independent of or in combination with the Non-PII collected by Innovid, such as audience interest segments and product categories.

The Non-PII collected by Innovid and/or received from third parties may be shared and used to provide information and reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Services, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Services and perform internal analysis, and to help Innovid display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users. Innovid may use certain general health-related segments received from third parties in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in such topics, such as general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, beauty and fitness. Such health-related segments do not include sensitive health information (such as an End User having a certain medical condition like heart disease or arthritis).

From time to time, advertisements served by Innovid may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter PII into such advertisements or into the landing page to which such advertisements are linked, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding an advertiser or publisher’s product, service, program or other offer. In the event that an End User elects to provide PII under such circumstances, Innovid may store such information and may share it with the advertiser, agency or publisher on behalf of whom the advertisement was served, and/or with such entity’s service provider. Innovid may use such information to fulfill or aid in the fulfillment of the End User’s request and/or to auto-populate future requests by the End User’s device. In cases where the advertisement contains functionality enabling Innovid to store the PII, the End User will have the option to opt-out of the storage of such information by indicating its preference in the appropriate checkbox shown in the advertisement. The End User should review the advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy to understand how such entity will process the PII entered by the End User. If you would like Innovid to delete all records of your PII, please send us an email at [privacy@innovid.com.](mailto:privacy@innovid.com)

Innovid works with Nielsen to better understand the reach of ad campaigns. To learn more about what information Nielsen collects, how it uses and shares that information and your choices, please visit [http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy.](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy)

### 

Cross-Device Tracking

Innovid may, or may use the services of third party companies to, establish connections between a user’s devices and to provide interest-based advertising across devices. Cross-device connections allow Innovid to understand that a single user is accessing advertisements served or measured by Innovid from multiple devices and to synchronize or target advertising messages and/or measure the performance of advertisements across those devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit the NAI Mobile Choices page located [here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice) or the Ghostery opt-out program (currently available at <https://www.ghostery.com/support/global-opt-out/> to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android (see <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>), to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps. 

### 

Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising

End Users can opt out of interest-based advertising served by Innovid. Click Here to opt-out, or opt-out through the NAI page located [here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) In order to comply with an opt-out request, Innovid may set a non-unique cookie for the sole purpose of complying with such request. If an End User deletes its cookies or changes computers or devices after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by clicking the link in this paragraph. Please note that where an End User blocks cookies on his or her browser, Innovid will be unable to set an opt-out cookie, and therefore unable to abide by such End User opt-out request. In addition, to opt out on a mobile device, you may visit the NAI Mobile Choices opt-out page located [here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/) Following an opt-out, Innovid's system will still provide advertisements to the End User. Please note, however, that these advertisements may be less relevant to such End User's interests. 

### 

Data Retention

###
