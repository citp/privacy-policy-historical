    * Your Internet domain, e.g., Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.,
    * You computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, UNIX, Linux, etc.,
    * Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit, and where you go as your leave (sometimes called “clickstream data”),
    * Your computer’s IP Address, and
    * A date/time stamp.



This information is automatically stored in log files, and helps us analyze trends with regard to use of the Website so we can make the Website more useful. For example, we use this information to track how users are finding the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, determine which pages are visited the most often, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. However, this information does not identify individual users.

  3. **Information You Provide to Us Voluntarily**



In addition, when you contact us with questions, opinions or feedback, we collect certain personal information that you provide, such as your first and last name and e-mail address.
