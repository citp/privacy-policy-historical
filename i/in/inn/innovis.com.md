## Scope of this Policy

Innovis Data Solutions, Inc. has created this privacy policy in order to describe how we collect, use, maintain, share, and protect your personal information when you use our website, www.innovis.com. 

This privacy policy applies to information collected when you visit our website. It does not apply to information collected in any other way, including information collected offline. 

## Children's Privacy

Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor and want to request the minor’s Innovis Credit Report, please visit our [Learning Center](https://web.archive.org/personal/lc_minorsProtected) to learn more. 

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise this privacy policy from time to time. If we do, we will post the revised version here. You should periodically check here for the most up-to-date version of this privacy policy. Any changes that affect how we use or disclose personal information will not be retroactively applied. 

## Information Automatically Collected

When you visit our website, we may automatically collect and store general Internet data, including your internet protocol (IP) address, device ID, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, which of our web pages you visited, the referring Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and how long you spend on each page. Your IP address is linked with the personal information that you provide on our website. We use this information for a number of purposes, such as investigating security incidents, running analytics to understand usage, and for compliance with security standards. 

## Personal Information

We do not collect personal information when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide it to us. You may elect to share personal information with us by filling out the information on our Request Product Information page, such as name, email address, phone number, and any other personal information you choose to provide. We use information you send to us through the Request Product Information page to respond to your inquiries or comments. 

If you are creating an Innovis Personal Account, submitting a Fraud & Activity Duty Alert, ordering an Innovis Credit Report, or requesting a Security Freeze through our site, you may elect to provide personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number in order for us to process your request. 

If you order your Innovis Credit Report, you can create a personal account which will allow you to initiate a dispute on your report if you believe information is incomplete or inaccurate. By doing so, when you log in, you have the option of providing us with additional information during the online dispute which may be of a personal nature. Personal information you provide to us during the dispute process may be incorporated into our database and used on future reports. The additional information you provide to us is within your discretion and will be used for the purpose of investigating your dispute. If you forget the password to your personal account, we may ask you to select a phone number to send a passcode. In this process, we use your name and phone number to detect possible fraudulent activity. Your phone number will be sent to Innovis vendors to determine whether the phone number or service has been recently manipulated, which prevents hackers from using your phone number to gain access to your account. Additionally, your phone number will be sent to a vendor that will deliver the passcode to your phone. This vendor has locations in the United States and one in the Netherlands, where your number will be stored at one of the locations for 90 days. In order to prevent fraudulent activity, your name and phone number captured during this password reset process are used to alert Innovis or its customers of frequent passcode requests to the same phone number and other patterns of a suspicious nature. This also helps protect you from identity thieves attempting to open or gain access to several accounts in your name.
