<li><strong>Information We Collect<a name="information-we-collect"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We collect various types of information from our visitors which we use in the general administration of the Website, to improve the content and usability of the Website in order to meet our users’ needs and expectations, and to present to users of the Website more targeted advertising, products and services. This information is collected automatically through cookies or other Internet tracking technologies.&gt;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Information Collected Automatically<a name="information-collected-automatically"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Each time you visit the Website, your browser or internet session automatically sends to us, and we automatically collect, the following types of information:</p>
<ol start="2">
<ul>
<li>Your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc.,</li>
<li>Your Internet domain, e.g., Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc.,</li>
<li>You computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, UNIX, Linux, etc.,</li>
<li>Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit, and where you go as your leave (sometimes called “clickstream data”),</li>
<li>Your computer’s IP Address, and</li>
<li>A date/time stamp.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>This information is automatically stored in log files, and helps us analyze trends with regard to use of the Website so we can make the Website more useful. For example, we use this information to track how users are finding the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, determine which pages are visited the most often, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. However, this information does not identify individual users.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Information You Provide to Us Voluntarily<a name="information-you-provide-voluntarily"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, when you contact us with questions, opinions or feedback, we collect certain personal information that you provide, such as your first and last name and e-mail address.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>How We Use Information Collected Automatically<a name="how-we-use-information-collected-automatically"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We use the information we automatically collect only in the general administration of the Website, and to help us improve the Website to better meet your information needs.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>How We Use Information That You Provide to Us Voluntarily<a name="how-we-use-information-you-provide-voluntarily"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your e-mail address will be used <strong><em>only</em></strong> in the following circumstance:</p>
<ol start="5">
<ul>
<li>We may send a message to you directly, following up on your feedback.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Your e-mail address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person without your prior consent.</p>
<p>We will use the other personal information you have voluntarily provided to us for marketing purposes <strong><em>only</em></strong> with your prior permission. Otherwise, all personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence.</p>
<p>Except as explained above, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we will not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information, unless required by law, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Website, or for the protection of a Contributor’s use of the Website or participation in the publication process. However, we <strong><em>will</em></strong> share certain aggregate Website usage information or other aggregated demographic information about users of the Website in a <strong><em>non-personally identifiable</em></strong> manner with advertisers, partners, and other third parties in order to present to users of the Website more targeted advertising, products and services. In such situations we will <strong><em>never </em></strong>disclose information that would personally identify you.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Our Security Measures<a name="our-security-measures"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can email us at editor@innerbody.com.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Why We Use “Cookies”<a name="why-we-use-cookies"></a></strong></li>

<p>We also use third party advertisers to display ads and collect information on the Website.

<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Website Users Located Outside of the United States of America<a name="website-users-located-outside-united-states"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We have made an effort to protect the personal information of all users of the Website, and to the extent applicable, we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws. If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with the applicable local rules where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to the Website. <strong>IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION</strong> (see, for example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of which can be found <a href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML">here</a>). If you are located in a country outside of the United States of America, and you submit personal information to the Website, we will consider such submission to be your consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of that information in the United States of America.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Business Transitions<a name="business-transitions"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. Where feasible, you will be notified via e-mail of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. However, we reserve the right to notify you of any such change by prominently posting a notice on the Website for 30 days after any such change.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>Changes in This Privacy Policy<a name="changes-in-privacy-policy"></a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes in the currently available version of this Privacy Policy, on the Website’s homepage, and any other place we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
