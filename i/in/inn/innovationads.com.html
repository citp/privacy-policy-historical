                          is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 
                          the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
                          our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
                          are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
                          Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable 
                          information are in a secure environment, in a locked 
                          facility.</span></p>

                          and other places we deem appropriate so our users are 
                          always aware of what information we collect, how we 
                          use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
                          it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy

                          the time of collection we will notify users via email. 
                          Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use 
                          their information in this different manner. However,

                          on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some 
                          cases where we post a notice we will also email users,
