    <p>You agree that your submission of personal information at the Website constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR Part 310 (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we or our designee retain the right and you hereby expressly authorize us and/or our designee to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, making a purchase from, or requesting information from, a third party advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, direct mail and/or telephone by such third party advertiser.</p>

    <p>We may share with third party advertisers certain Website usage information of individuals that have received targeted promotional campaigns for the purpose of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we may track some of the pages that you visit on our Website through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).

    <p>We also may use "cookies" to enhance your experience in using our Website. Cookies are text files that we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences.

If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes, please click here **enable click-through to opt-out page** or email us at customerservice@innpointsworldwide.com. However, where California residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared with third party marketing partners, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with the law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we agree not to share the social security number of California State residents with third-parties, if you have provided us with such information and identified yourself as a California resident, without first obtaining their consent to do so pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the California Financial Information Privacy Act ("CFIPA"). For purposes of compliance with the CFIPA, we will not share "nonpublic personal information" (as defined in the CFIPA) with our affiliates without providing California State residents with an annual notice explaining that we will be sharing this nonpublic personal information with our affiliates. To fully execute a CFIPA consent acknowledgement, click here **connect them to RIDER 1, below**.</p>

<p>Important Information for Vermont Customers<br>

In accordance with Vermont law, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents to nonaffiliated third-party companies except with the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident. By submitting personal information to us, you are providing your affirmative consent for us to sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose information we collect about you to affiliates and non-affiliated third-parties for the purposes identified in this policy. You may revoke your opt-in choice at any time by contacting us at  HYPERLINK "mailto:info@innpoints.com" info@innpoints.com </p>

<p>Security<br>

We employ industry standard security measures to safeguard against unauthorized access to information that we collect online. When users submit sensitive information via the Website, we endeavor to keep this information protected both online and off-line. Online, we utilize SSL encryption software in connection with sensitive information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Access is not granted to employees who do not have a â€œneed to knowâ€ the information. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that there has been an information security breach. By submitting personally identifiable information to us, you are providing your affirmative consent to receive such notifications via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of breach and/or network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>

<p>Acceptance<br>

By using the Website and/or agreeing to receive information via e-mail from us, you agree to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will prominently post notice that the Privacy Policy has changed and provide a link to those changes on our Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Website. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Website and/or acceptance of our e-mail communications following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of any and all changes.</p>
