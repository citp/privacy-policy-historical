### Types of information we collect

We may collect personal information about you when you deal with us over the telephone, send as correspondance (whether by letter, fax or email), visit our web site or when you have contact with us in person. As well as collecting information directly from you, there may be occasions when we collect information about you from a third party. For Example:

  * From people making enquiries or purchases on your behalf

Some of the information we collect is essential for us to be able to accurately identify who is using our products or services. In the case of enrolment into our Nationally Accredited Training Courses, accurate identification of participants is mandatory to help prevent academic fraud. 

### Disclosure of personal information to third parties.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties, for example, contractors to whom we contract out certain services. In these situations, we prohibit the third party contractor from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it. 

We may also disclose your personal information to various law enforcement agencies and governments around the world for security and customs purposes. 

Your information may also be shared between related companies in the Inner Range group, where necessary, to fulfil our purposes. 

Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.

### Access to and correction of information we hold about you.
