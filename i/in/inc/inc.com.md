Privacy Statement

Inc.com is committed to maintaining the trust of our users. This statement explains how we collect information from you and what we do with that information.

### Information Requests

Inc.com offers a variety of on-line resources. To make full use of the resources on our site, we ask you to provide some basic information.

When you sign up to receive an Inc.com newsletter, you will be asked for your E-mail address. If you wish to participate in other Inc.com services or to access free tools, you will be asked to register. You'll give us a username, password, and E-mail address so that you can use the personalized features on our site.

### Promotions

Unless you opt out, we may use your registration information to send you promotional materials that we think may interest you.

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that most Web sites, including Inc.com, place on your computer. Cookies help us identify your interests. They also prevent you from having to register repeatedly on Inc.com or from repeatedly seeing the same ads.

Cookies delivered to you through banner ads are collected by our advertisers. We don't have access to any specific information they may provide. Those serving banner ads on our site only provide us with information in aggregate form. No individual information is given to us. Inc.com is not able, and does not wish, to use cookies to track your activities on the Web outside of our site. And no cookie delivered by us will interfere with the operation of your computer.

### Shared Information

You should review the privacy policies of our partner sites to confirm the way in which they handle their users' information.

In those instances where our sharing of information is expressly noted at the time you provide it, we may provide that information to those partners specified in the notice. The use of this information by that partner will then be subject to the partner's privacy policies.

Inc.com may share information gathered from its users, in aggregate form, with others such as advertisers or sponsors.

### General Considerations

Inc.com cannot guarantee that the information you provide to us is completely safe, although we are careful to try to prevent problems. There may be technical problems beyond our control that may make it accessible to unauthorized persons. There may also be visitors to the site who gather and use information available there.

There may be occasions on which Inc.com is required to provide information by order of a court or when the law requires that user information be treated as a transferable asset, as in bankruptcy.

Internet-based commerce is dynamic and changing. We may revise our privacy policy in the future to adjust to such changes. We recommend that you check it frequently.

### Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal in-formation), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

### Third Party Cookies

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
