## Interest-based advertising

The information you provide to us about your interest in our products may be pseudonymized and shared with third parties, where allowable, to provide more relevant advertising of Imperva products and services.

We do not track your other activities on that website.

## Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

Imperva cooperates with governments, regulators, and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including subpoenas and court orders); to protect the property and rights of Imperva or a third party; the safety of the public or any person; to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity; or to comply with the law.

  * the use of endpoint protection software, encryption, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure that they comply with our security policies,
  * controlled access to our facilities and secure destruction of media containing your information, and
  * training and awareness programs on security and privacy to ensure employees understand the importance of and how to protect your information.



Additionally, all our employees have agreed to observe your privacy and confidentiality rights.

## Data Retention

Personal data will be maintained only as necessary to satisfy the reasons for which it was collected. We also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

## Cookies

Like many websites, we also use “cookies” and similar technology to, for example, collect additional website usage data and to improve our websites and service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. Some cookies may collect personal data in order to perform their intended functions. For example, in order to enable live chat assistance across multiple Imperva pages, a cookie may collect and store your name and chat history for the session. Imperva may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our websites and our service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our websites, and to improve our websites and services. Authorized third parties may also place their own cookies on our websites, and may collect personal information. For more information about how we use cookies and the cookies you are consenting to use by visiting our website, review our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/Other/Privacy/Cookies).

## Our Policy Towards Children

Imperva’s business is not focused on, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, he or she should contact us at [privacy@imperva.com](mailto:privacy@imperva.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will remove that information.

## Links to other websites

Our websites contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a third party website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. When you leave Imperva web properties, these other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. This privacy policy addresses the use and disclosure of personal information that we collect from you through Imperva web properties or that you otherwise provide to Imperva. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the third party websites you visit.

## Managing your information

## Choice to opt-out
