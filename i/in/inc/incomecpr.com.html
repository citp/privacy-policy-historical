We provide the same protections for these electronic   communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail   and telephone. </p>
      <p>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
        Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web   site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below,   "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how   our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs   may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web   site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.</p>
      <p>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</p>
      <p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering   our business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to   process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing and   promotional efforts and improve our content and service offerings, and customize   our site's content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes. These uses   improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate   basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be   shared with parties except as required by law.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about   important changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you   will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive   these offers by emailing us at the link provided on the newsletter.</p>
      <p>What Are Cookies?<br>
        A cookie is a very small text document, which often   includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's   computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your   hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own   cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect   your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has   already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are   usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive   cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If   you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas   of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie   cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer   viruses.</p>
      <p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?<br>
        As you visit and browse   our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In   some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than   is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log   files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web   site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback   to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not   allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not   intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in   your cookies.</p>
      <p>IP Addresses<br>
        IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are   connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers   on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically   collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as   “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to   you.</p>
      <p>Sharing and Selling Information<br>
        We do not share, sell, lend or lease any   of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses   or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process   transactions or provide services that you have requested.</p>
      <p>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?<br>
        You may request access to   all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain   in our database by emailing us at the usual address.</p>
      <p>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
        We may disclose   information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good   faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal   rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe   that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring   legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to   protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>
      <p>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?<br>
        We are not responsible   for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the   information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are   provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the   users of our Web site.</p>
      <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another   web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and   interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our   Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over   those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
      <p>Your Consent<br>
        By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use   of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the   right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</p>
      <p>Our Commitment To Data Security<br>
        Please note that your information will be   stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding   personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your   Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain   data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place   appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and   secure the information we collect online.</p>
      <p>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br>
        This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that   they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue   sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</p>
      <p>Surveys &amp; Contests<br>
        From time-to-time our site requests information   from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests   is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to   disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information   (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip   code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and   award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or   improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
      <p>A Special Note About Children<br>
        Children are not eligible to use our   services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not   submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this   service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or   guardians.</p>
      <p>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership<br>
        In the event that the web site (or a   substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be   considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are   transferred.</p>
      <p>Policy Modifications<br>
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.   If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have   given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check   back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes   in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us   under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this   Privacy Policy, without your prior consent</p>
