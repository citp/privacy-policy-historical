# Incredible Edible Egg | Eggs | About AEB - Privacy Policy

### American Egg Board Promotions

The American Egg Board (“AEB”) is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users who use all Web sites maintained by the American Egg Board (the “Sites”), including individuals that submit information in response to promotions or contests appearing on the Sites. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [aeb@aeb.org](mailto:aeb@aeb.org) or by writing:  American Egg Board, 1460 Renaissance Drive, Park Ridge, IL 60068. All AEB promotions and contests are limited to persons 18 years of age or older accessing the Sites from the United States.

### Information Voluntarily Provided by You

Any personally identifiable information you send us through use of the Sites will be used in connection with the promotion or contest for which you submitted the information. This may include providing your information to an agent or service provider for AEB who uses the information solely on AEB’s behalf.

We may also use the information to contact you about other AEB promotions or contests, or about the Sites. If, at any time, you want AEB to stop contacting you, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [aeb@aeb.org](mailto:aeb@aeb.org). You can also contact us at the same address to access and/or correct any personal identifying information AEB is maintaining about you. We reserve the right to use or disclose your information as we believe is necessary to comply with applicable laws, to respond to legally appropriate requests and as is reasonably necessary for AEB and/or its service providers to manage and/or improve its business operations.

### Information Storage/Security

AEB and its service providers use reasonable security measures to protect the personally identifiable information gathered on our Sites. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We ask that you do your part, by maintaining any computer passwords you use to access the Internet or the Sites strictly confidential.
