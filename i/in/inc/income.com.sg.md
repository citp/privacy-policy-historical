  1. What Personal Information do we collect?
    1. Information you give us   
We receive and store any information you enter on our web site when you register with us or give us in any other way, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Several of the services that we offer on our sites, may require registration as a condition of use. 

We also collect anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you, such as your age, gender and personal interests. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs and to customize our service to make your experience easier. 

We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

    2. Automatic Information   
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us, for example, your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. 

We use "cookies", which store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites to allow us to track general traffic patterns, user profiles and preferences, number and frequency of users when your Web browser accesses 'Income coop'.com. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of our sites, although participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies. In addition, you may choose not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting the appropriate options on your browser. 

We use tracking technologies in different ways, including: 

      1. Keeping count of return visits to our sites or our advertisers' or strategic partners' sites; 
      2. Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on web site and advertisement usage; 
      3. Determining which features users like best; and 
      4. Saving your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites. 

This information is used for the operation of our service, to maintain the quality of our service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of our website. 

Please bear in mind that if you directly disclose personal information through forums, this information may be collected and used by others. 

    3. Third Party Advertisement Servers  
Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on our sites and in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.
  2. How we use the information?

We use the information we gather for the following purposes: 

    * To customize our site's advertising, content, layout and services
    * To resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems
    * To improve our marketing and promotional efforts and product offerings 
    * To enhance customers' experience in our network of sites
    * To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out e-mails, processing your online shopping or service requests and enabling customers to participate in surveys, contests and forums
    * To send you information on topics targeted to your interest, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings and communications relevant to your use of the site
  3. How we share or disclose the information?

We may disclose your personal information under certain circumstances where: 

    * we have your consent to share the information 
    * we have engaged external companies to work with or on behalf of [Income coop] to provide a product or service that your have requested 
    * we use internal service providers to facilitate our services (e.g. surveys, discussion forums) 
    * you use co-branded services. When you use a co-branded service within our network of sites you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that external service partner 
    * you participate in contests or other promotional programs on our site sponsored or organized by third parties, or purchase goods and services offered by third parties 
    * we buy or sell a business, and customer information is one of the transferred assets 
    * we share our data with our subsidiaries, joint ventures and strategic partners that are committed to serving your online trading needs and related services 
    * we respond to court orders or legal processes, or we believe that your actions violate applicable laws, our Terms of Use or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights or property of 'Income coop', our users or others 
  4. We strictly protect the security of your personal identifiable information. 

We secure your personal information in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, using industry standard security techniques. We also limit access of personal information about you to certain employees who we believe reasonably need the information to provide services to you. 

When highly confidential information is transmitted over the Internet, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

While we take all reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, "perfect security" however does not exist on the Internet. It is therefore also important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging out the web site when you are finished.

  5. What other options do you have?

Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still browse and view much of our content and use many of the services offered by our sites without registering. 

We also give users the following options: 

    * opting not to receive e-mails or newletters from us or third parties. Users who opt-in may remove themselves from the mailing lists at any time if they so wish 
    * opting not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site; 
    * adding or updating certain personal information collected during registration for any site at any time and as often as necessary; 
    * opting to disable "cookies" or prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, by clicking on the "help" portion of your toolbar. 
  6. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. All modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected by the posting of the amended terms on our web site. 

In addition, if there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our sites that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy policy. 

If we are going to use the information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will also notify you of the amendments by administrative notices, announcements or e-mails.
