<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Information Collection and Use</font></b><br>
  <span class="incisive">Incisive Media </span> is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. 
  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to third parties in ways other 
  than those disclosed in this policy. <span class="incisive">Incisive Media </span> collects information 
from our users at several different points on our websites.
</p><p align="justify&quot;"><span class="308584410-14122005">Incisive Media  includes Incisive Media and all of its subsidiary companies (Incisive Financial Publishing Limited, Incisive Photographic Limited, Global Professional Media Limited, Conjecture Limited, Incisive Media Investments Limited, Incisive RWG Inc, Incisive Interactive Marketing LLC).</span>
</p><p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Registration</font></b><br>
  some of our sites restrict access to online content. To gain entry a user must 
  first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to 
  give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). For sites 
  where online access to content is part of a subscription package, registration 
  forms will often contain full subscriber details used to identify and fulfil 
  that subscriber's account. </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">E-mail alerts</font></b><br>
  If a user wishes to subscribe to our alerts, updates, briefings etc. we ask 
  for contact and delivery information such as name and e-mail address. All of 
  these e-mail lists provide opt out facilities online and with each e-mail broadcast. 
  In some cases the user is asked to provide optional demographic and personal 
  interest information that is used to keep our content as relevant as possible. 
</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Sharing</font></b><br>
  We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
  This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual 
  person. We would also share information when using an outside shipping company 
  to ship orders or a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and 
  services.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;">On some sites, which generate reports from directories and listings, 
  we share the names and e-mail addresses of an individual user with some of companies 
  whose products and services are mentioned within that report. Where this occurs 
  there is an opt out provided if a user does not wish to receive any contact 
  from those companies.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Orders</font></b><br>
  We request information from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide 
  contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information 
  (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing 
  purposes and to fulfil customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
  this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. All online transactions 
  are processed using SSL encryption (see Security for more detail)</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Cookies</font></b><br>
  Many of our sites use cookies - A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's 
  hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of cookies is for the 
  convenience of visitors. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the 
  user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time 
  while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. 
  Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users in 
  order to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use 
  cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to, 
  or control over, these cookies.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Clear Gifs</font></b><br>
  We employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons/Web 
  Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content 
  is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar 
  in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. 
  The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the 
  page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 
  Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. In addition, 
  we use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have 
  been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of 
  certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. All 
  of our e-mail newsletters provide the facility to opt-out (see opt-out section 
  below). </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Log Files</font></b><br>
  We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track a user's movement, 
  and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are 
  not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Links</font></b><br>
  Some of our websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Incisive 
  Media  is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This 
  privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Surveys &amp; Contests</font></b><br>
  From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. 
  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user 
  therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
  requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
  and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information 
  will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will 
  be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of 
  this site.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Recommend this site</font></b><br>
  If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
  site, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically 
  send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. This information 
  is not stored except for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Security</font></b><br>
  This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When 
  users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected 
  both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
  sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), 
  that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software 
  in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock 
  icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you 
  are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
  online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
  above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
  to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
  representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The 
  servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure 
  environment.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Special Offers</font></b><br>
  On some sites new members receive a welcome e-mail to verify password and username. 
  Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, 
  special deals, and a newsletter. Where this is the case we present the option 
  to not receive these types of communications at the point of sign up. </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Site and Service Updates</font></b><br>
  We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not 
  able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information 
  about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services 
  and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone. </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Correction/Updating Personal Information</font></b><br>
  If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), 
  or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way 
  to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This 
  can be done at the registration page or by e-mailing the site editor. Many of 
  our sites will offer subscribers an account management facility that will allow 
  them to change or amend their own records.</p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Choice/Opt-out</font></b><br>
  Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information 
  used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask 
  for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive a newsletter/alert/briefing 
  etc. may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the unsubscribe 
  link in the e-mail or online. </p>
<p align="justify&quot;"><b><font color="black">Notification of Changes</font></b><br>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will seek to advise all users 
  of these changes.</p>
<font color="black"><b>Discussion boards:</b></font><br>
<p>While we take every precaution to ensure all contributions to discussion boards are factually correct, and not deemed to be untruthful, libellous, defamatory, racist or persecutory, these messages are entered by third parties.  All users of the board are presented with a set of house rules before taking part. Our editor will monitor as much as possible and although all users of the site are entitled to their opinion, language on the boards must be clean - contributions containing sexual swear words and slander will be removed.  Users will be warned if breaking the house rules. A user who consistently breaks the house rules will be barred from the discussion boards`.  All users are reminded of copyright - Articles from other websites should be linked to rather than copied in full. Articles from within <span class="incisive">Incisive Media </span> publications/websites may be copied in their entirety for use on <span class="incisive">Incisive Media </span> discussion boards.  <span class="incisive">Incisive Media </span> reserves the right to remove articles without notice or reason.</p>
