Notice of Information Collected and Disclosed

CardLab collects personal information during the purchase and customization of Visa® Incentive Cards (an “ **Incentive Card** ”) and this information may be collected in a variety of ways. In addition, in connection with your use of our Site we may collect the following information:

**a)      The domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Site.**

**b)     The e-mail addresses of users who communicate with us via the Site or via e-mail.**

**c)      Aggregate information on what webpages our Site users access or visit. **

**d)     Information volunteered by the user, such as information provided if the user requests information regarding the purchase of Incentive Cards through the Site**

**e)      Information provided by consumer customers which may include name, physical address, billing address, ESI ID number, electric service account numbers, e-mail address, phone number, username, password and other personal information as indicated on forms throughout our Site.**

**f)      Information provided by corporate customers which may include tax identification number, number of years in business and Incentive Card purpose.**

**g)     Information about your transactions with us. **

To process payments for Incentive Cards purchased through our Site, we may require your name, billing address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information. These transactions are processed by CardLab, a PCI Level 1 certified compliant payment processing provider. CardLab will receive and store your credit card information. The e-commerce payment gateway is provided by CyberSource and you can review their Privacy Statement at www.cybersource.com/privacy.php.

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. Providing the voluntary data described above is at your sole discretion. If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Site, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Site and any Incentive Cards you may purchase. 

CardLab may occasionally ask customers to complete surveys and provide opinions about interests, needs, and viewpoints. These surveys help CardLab provide better products to meet our customer’s needs. When customers contact the CardLab customer service department it may be necessary to obtain personal information for record keeping and follow-up.

Use and Disclosure of Information

Primarily, CardLab uses the information our customers provide to contact them for Incentive Card purchase and marketing purposes. For example, we may send marketing or promotional materials related to new product offerings or we may need to contact a customer in the course of fulfilling a purchase request. Most commonly we use personal information to confirm and verify financial information to process payments. 

CardLab is the owner of the information collected on this Site. Except as provided in this Policy, we do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone except as permitted by law, however,we may choose to disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other similar companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Your information may be disclosed to companies that provide support services to us in relation to those services, such as data processors, technical systems consultants and programmers. Additionally, this information may be shared with some CardLab partners. CardLab may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, sponsors and other third parties, though such summary information will not identify any specifics directly related to your identity. We may also provide analysis based on the information we collect, to our risk sharing partners. We may use the personal identifying information you provide to administer Site usage and monitor traffic-levels, and to contact you regarding improvements we can make to our Site and our services, if necessary. 

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets and, depending on the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. Similarly, if CardLab should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with or be acquired by another company, we may sell the information you provide to us to a third party or share your personal information with any entity resulting from such transaction.

We may use your e-mail address to contact you directly regarding services, products or information that we believe might interest you.   Only CardLab (or agents working on behalf of CardLab and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us. **   **Or, at any time you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from CardLab by contacting us and requesting to have your name removed from our lists.  

You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other illegal activity. 

We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

Your Disclosure Choices

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Site, in which case CardLab may not be able to provide a Incentive Card to you. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before creating your user account.  The user that created the account for a user is responsible for maintaining the secrecy of such user’s unique password and account information at all times. 

Cookies

We use cookies (a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them), log files, clear gifs or web beacons (known as action tags or single pixel gifs) information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; and (c) to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Site. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to users, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened.

When you register at the Site, CardLab uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We may use this ID to identify you in our database and to track information while you are on our Site. Cookies also enable you to enter the Site as a registered user without having to log on each time.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Site. However, if you turn off cookies, then you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Site. 

Confidentiality of Transmissions

Please remember that transmissions on the Internet are not always confidential. You are transmitting your personal information to CardLab at your own risk. 

Abuse of Terms of Use

We have the right to share your name and contact information with our attorneys and law enforcement officials, if needed, in the event we believe you have breached our Terms of Use Agreement.

Choice/Opt‑Out

If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). ** ** If you receive communications from us that you do not want to receive, you can opt‑out from receiving these communications, by specifically telling us to stop sending them to you. We will generally be able to give effect to your withdrawal on 30 days’ notice. If you wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, you may fax your request to CardLab at the following number: (866) 376-9075.          ** **

Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)

We will apply the Choice/Opt-Out policies discussed above in the event we propose to disclose your information to a third party. 

Security

This Site takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, your information is protected both online and off-line. For your security, our credit card processing vendor encrypts sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In order for SSL to work, though, you must have a browser that supports SSL technology. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. To learn about SSL, follow this link:  _http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2005/ssl.asp_. 

It should be noted that e‑mails and other information you send to us, except that which you send us on a secure page, is not encrypted and such transmissions cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information. CardLab will never ask you to submit your financial data, such as your credit card account numbers, via e-mail. IF YOU RECEIVE AN EMAIL REQUESTING THAT YOU FORWARD INFORMATION OF THIS NATURE BY EMAIL, PLEASE CONTACT US DIRECTLY AT (214) 618-7040. DO NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THE EMAIL. Please [click here](http://www.onguardonline.gov/topics/phishing.aspx) to find out more information regarding internet scams of this nature often referred to as phishing.   You should be aware of the limitations of security, authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in connection with the Internet and that any information you transmit through the Site may be damaged, corrupted, “sniffed” and/or accessed by another person without your permission. 

Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, with access restricted.

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit. 

Linked Sites

The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that CardLab may not be responsible for content or the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and recommend that they read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit. This Policy applies solely to information collected by this Site.

Age Restrictions; Children’s Privacy

This Site is not directed at children under the age of 18 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. If CardLab obtains actual knowledge that it has obtained personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information is immediately and permanently deleted from our records.
