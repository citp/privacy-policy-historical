**Inc42’s Use of Cookies**

Inc42 may place “cookies” on your computer or device that may contain anonymous Information that is associated with you. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize users, and are typically placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain (here, Inc42) that issued the cookie to you or that, in some cases, can be read by a third party domain.

Our cookies may record Information about your use of Inc42 so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you, including for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify visitors; assess usage patterns; identify preferences; control the display of ads; diagnose problems with our servers; gather demographic information; analyze trends and usage patterns; conduct research; deliver editorial content; record registration and personalized information; and otherwise administer Inc42 products and services.

If you do not wish to have Inc42 place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse cookies before accessing Inc42.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Inc42 that depend on cookies.

**Inc42 does not control and is not responsible for the use of cookies by its third party partners or advertisers**.

**Keeping Your Data Confidential, & Resilient**

We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available. Specifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt disaster recovery. We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls.

Every part of the Services utilize properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of failure. We take servers out of operation as part of regular maintenance, without impacting availability.

We keep encrypted backups of data every hour in multiple regions. While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore organizational data from these backups.

**Recovery** : In the event of a region-wide outage, we will bring up a duplicate environment in a different region. Our operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.

**Access Controls** : inc42 is hosted on AWS. Amazon has many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure. AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities, and critical facilities have extensive setback and military grade perimeter control berms as well as other natural boundary protection. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication no fewer than three times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff. Amazon only provides data center access and information to employees who have a legitimate business need for such privileges. When an employee no longer has a business need for these privileges, his or her access is immediately revoked, even if they continue to be an employee of Amazon or Amazon Web Services. All physical and electronic access to data centers by Amazon employees is logged and audited routinely. Inc42 employees do not have control or access to AWS centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.

**Logical Access Controls:** Inc42 is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure, and only designated authorized Inc42 operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network. Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.

**Intrusion Detection and Prevention:** Unusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Inc42’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and management. AWS intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods. IDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place. We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.
