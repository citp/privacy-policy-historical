<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. We do not use an SSL certificate.</p>

<h2>How we use cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>

<p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.</p>

<p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>

<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>

<p>If you disable cookies, it will turn off some of the features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>

<p>The following are not Strictly Necessary, but are required to provide you with the best user experience and also to tell us which pages you find most interesting (anonymously).</p>

<h3>Functional Cookies</h3>

<p>This Website Will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Track the pages you visits via Google Analytics</li>
	<li>Create a cookie if you switch the website language, to remember your language preference</li>
</ul>

<h3>Targeting Cookies</h3>

<p>This Website Will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allow you to share pages with social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.</li>
	<li>Serve Google AdSense ads based on your interests</li>
</ul>

<p>We use third party advertisements on inobscuro.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>

<h3>DoubleClick DART cookies</h3>
<p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</p>

<p>You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>

<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>

<h2>Third Party Disclosure</h2>

<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>

<p>We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

<h2>Links to other websites</h2>

<p>Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>

<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>

<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
	<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
	<li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
	<li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes: On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
	<li>Users are able to change their personal information: By emailing us</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h3>

<p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

<h3>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h3>

<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>

<h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>
<br>
We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

<h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
<br>
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days</li>
	<li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days</li>
</ul>

<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
	<li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>To be accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
	<li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li>
	<li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li>
	<li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
	<li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li>
	<li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li>
</ul>

<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
