We will never sell or misuse the information you provide in any way. Sometimes this information will be shared with other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including the mailing and delivering of products and catalogs. In these cases, we will provide only that information which is necessary for the service to be completed.

Your personal information is never shared outside of our company without your expressed permission, except under the conditions explained above. When you submit any type of sensitive data online (i.e. - Credit card information), it is encrypted and passed along to our company through a _secure socket layer_ \-- the e-commerce encryption standard that is guaranteed to keep your data safe. Internally, your information is stored on IV's password-controlled remote server with guarded user access.
