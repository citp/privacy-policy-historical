# INO.com Help - Privacy Policy

INO.com, Inc., as a leading financial website and creator of various subscriber services, is committed to protecting the personal information that you submit to us. As a consequence, we guarantee never to deliberately disclose individually identifiable information about you to any outside source without your express consent.

In the process of operating our various subscribers services, we collect personal information via order forms, feedback forms, online surveys, user emails and other communications. We also gather general information about site usage including statistics for hits, unique visits, repeat visits and page views.

The total information we receive enables INO.com to make improvements to all of our web properties for the benefit of all subscribers.

Personal information tendered to INO.com is used for a number of reasons, including the fulfillment of orders, the fulfillment of subscriptions, delivery of customer-requested email services, design and maintenance of INO.com's custom portfolio services, and when you request information from one of our advertising clients. This can only happen when you click to accept a special offer in a promotional email from INO.com or sign up for a free offer with an advertiser sponsorship. This information is then passed along to our advertising clients in order for them to fulfill your order or request.

Where custom portfolio services are concerned, the use of cookies may also be used to facilitate the login process. Please note that nothing in a cookie allows outside parties to identify you individually.

Cookies may also allow INO.com and our subscription services to utilize third party marketing tools including, but not limited to, those offered by Google Adwords, Bing Ads and Post Affiliate Pro. These tools may allow us track clicks, conversions and identify potential customers and visitors based on internet usage patterns and visited sites.

With email, we will only add you to one of our email lists if you have requested it. In addition, all of INO.com's email services are accompanied by a simple-to-use facility for unsubscribing. You may click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email. This will take you to a page where you can remove yourself from any or all subscribed lists. We will attempt to process this request within 24 business hours. You may also manage your subscriptions at <http://www.ino.com/email/>.

INO.com will only send you email if you sign up with us and request it. We are members of various anti-spam alliances and are certified, compliant email senders. We take our reputation very seriously and have a no-tolerance policy against spam or marketing in any way that is not initiated by the user.

We are committed to serve you in a discreet and professional manner.
