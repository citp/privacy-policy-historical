If you have any questions about our privacy policy or our use of your information, you can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@inventables.com">support@inventables.com</a>.</h4>

    <p>Below you will find information on a number of topics, including:</p>
    <ol class="standard">
     <li><a href="#general-info">What personally identifiable information of yours is collected from you through the Website;</a></li>
     <li><a href="#cookies">How the collected information is used;</a></li>
     <li><a href="#sharing">With whom such information may be shared;</a></li>

    </ol>
    
    <h3 id="general-info">General Information Collection and Use</h3>

    <p>Inventables is the sole owner of the information collected on the Website. Information collected is used to register the user for certain selected services (e.g. access to the Inventables database) and to contact the user about such services (e.g. e-mail address).</p>

    <p>Some of our services may be offered in conjunction with partner companies, affiliates or other companies or websites with which we work. In order for us to provide these services to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with one of such entities. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.</p>

    <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>

    <p>A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. As part of offering and providing personalized services, we may use cookies in an effort to save you time while on our Website. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still have limited use of the Website. Generally we use cookies to:</p>
    
    <ol class="standard">
    <li>Remind us who you are and to access your account information;</li>
    <li>Track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website; and</li>
    <li>Estimate our audience size and measure certain traffic patterns.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>IP Addresses</h3>

    <p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given an IP address. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, and our web servers do not record the e-mail addresses of our visitors.</p>

    <h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>

    <p>As a general rule, except as described in this privacy statement, we may disclose any of your personally identifiable information and under special circumstances (such as when we believe the law requires it). We may disclose or share aggregated demographic information with certain partners, affiliates and advertisers, however, except as described above, this is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person or company. In addition, Inventables may disclose account or other personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Inventables's rights or property, other Website users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. </p>

    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>This Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites, as this privacy statement applies solely to the Website. We encourage our users to remain vigilant when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. </p>

    <h3>Surveys</h3>

    <p>From time-to-time our Website may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys, to the extent we run any, is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website.</p>

    <h3 id="security">Security</h3>

    <p>All of our users' sensitive information is restricted in our offices. While Inventables employs commercially reasonable security measures to protect our data and seeks to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we therefore are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>

    <h3 id="corrections">Correction/Updating Personal Information</h3>

    <p>If your personally identifiable information changes at any time, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@inventables.com">support@inventables.com</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="choices">Choice/Opt-out</h3>

    <p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving communications from Inventables by sending us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@inventables.com">support@inventables.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

    <p>If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes under the appropriate link on the "home page" of our Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. The new terms shall be effective 10 days after they are initially posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each user to review the latest terms from time to time, and if any user does not agree with any updates to the privacy statement, such user should immediately cease use of the Website and purchased services.</p>
