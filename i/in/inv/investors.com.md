# Investor's Business Daily: Privacy Statement

 

## Investor's Business Daily, Inc. Privacy Policy Statement

Investor's Business Daily, Inc. ("IBD") owns and operates the Web site investors.com which is a companion to the newspaper, Investor's Business Daily. eIBD is the electronic version of Investor's Business Daily. IBD is committed to respecting and protecting your personal privacy. Our Privacy Policy is explained below.  
Investors Business Daily® is a registered trademark of Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

What Information Does IBD Collect From You and How is it Used?  
IBD is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. IBD collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

Registration and Order  
In order to use certain features of our Web site and eIBD, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and billing address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Cookies  
This site requires the use of browser cookies. Cookies are messages written in your browser. The messages store information so that our site immediately recognizes you each time you visit. This permits us to personalize our site for each member, allow access to the secure parts of our site that individual members have registered for and provide members with up-to-date information about their own account. 

Log Files  
We use cookies to store visitor preferences, record session information, such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. 

Sharing/Do Any Third Parties Receive or Collect your Information Through IBD?  
We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company will also perform a card authorization and fraud check, but this company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

Choice/Opt-out  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes of us sending them offers of interest. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive promotional materials from us or our sister company, Daily Graphs Online®, may opt-out of receiving these communications by accessing their member profile found on our Web site and they may then select to 'opt-out' or by sending contacting Customer Service through [www.askibd.com](http://www.askibd.com/). Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. (*Daily Graphs Online®, is a registered trademark of William O'Neil + Co., Inc.) 

Supplementation of Information and Advertisers  
In order to properly fulfill our obligations to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. Also, in order us to enhance our ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our sister company, Daily Graphs Online®, to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from either of these two companies, the companies may collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences. Additionally, to bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that place advertising on investors.com. We share non-identifying information with our advertisers. We do not disclose personal information that could be used to identify you. The technology used by advertising agencies to serve the ads may collect and store information such as your domain type, your IP address, and click-thru information via cookies. For further information, refer to the privacy policy of our advertising agency at [www.realmedia.com](http://www.realmedia.com/). 

Special Offers  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username, in addition, members who subscribe to our service will also receive an e-mail each time their subscription is renewed. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

Site and Service Updates  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

Security  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: [What is SSL?](https://web.archive.org/web/20021209095824id_/http%3A//www.investors.com/privacy/ssl.asp)

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access this information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you may inquire at [www.askibd.com](http://www.askibd.com/). 

Correction/Updating Personal Information:  
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire to use our service, we provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be done by accessing your personal profile on our Web site. 

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
