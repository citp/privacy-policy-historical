Security  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, that information is protected both online and off-line.

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, that information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape® and Microsoft Internet Explorer® becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: [What is SSL?](https://web.archive.org/privacy/ssl.asp) While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access this information. Furthermore, ALL employees are required to comply with our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can contact us at [www.askibd.com](http://www.askibd.com/).

Phishing  
Phishing is a term used to describe a type of Internet scam in which inauthentic emails that appear to be coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt to trick you into providing confidential information. These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often imply that your account is about to be closed unless immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to click on a link that leads you to a webpage that simulates that of the legitimate source, but is really a page specially designed to get you to input your confidential information such as account number, password, social security number or credit card number. The thieves then use that information to commit fraud and identity theft against you.

The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up a website providing information warning consumers about the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself. To learn more about phishing, please click on the following link: [www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm](http://www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm)

Please know that Investor's Business Daily takes the privacy of our subscribers very seriously. If you are ever in question about the legitimacy of an email from IBD, please contact customer service at: (800) 831-2525 or outside the United States 1-310-448-6600. If you believe you have been the victim of a scam, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at: [www.consumer.gov/idtheft/](http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/). If you have any additional questions about the security at our Web site, you can contact us at [www.askibd.com](http://www.askibd.com/).

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire to use our service, you may correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be done by accessing 'Edit Profile' on the Investors.com site.

Personal Information You Disclose

This means that your information may be viewed and/or collected and used by third parties without our or your knowledge. Such actions are not under our control and we are not responsible for events arising from your voluntary posting of personally identifiable information.
