  * The choices we offer, including how to access, update, and remove information



We have kept this simple for your understanding, but if you’re not familiar with terms like “cookies” or “IP addresses,” then feel free to contact us as set forth below. Your privacy is really important to us, so whether you’re new to InVision or a long-time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.

Collectively, the Software, the Website, and any other InVision services that link to this Privacy Policy are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Service.” In this Privacy Policy, “we,” “us,” “our,” and other similar references mean InVision, and “you” and “your” and other similar references mean any particular user of the Service.

**Cookies, Website and Application Use**

Like many websites and mobile application operators, we collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Website. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Website and to tell us how and when you interact with our Website. We may also use cookies to monitor usage and web traffic routing on our Website and to customize and improve our Service. We may link this information to your User Account. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Website and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Service. We may also use cookies in connection with third-party services to run analytics on our Website; such cookies may collect Personal Information about users.

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. The Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service. Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.

We may employ, and/or our third-party tracking utility company may employ, software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. These gifs (or other tracking technology) may be included in or associated with emails or other communications that you receive from us (or our partners) in order to help us track your response and interests and to deliver you relevant content and services. For example, they may let us know when you take actions based on the emails that we send. We may tie information gathered by clear gifs or other tracking technology to Personal Information.

Our servers may automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Website and Service (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both User Account holders and non-account holders. Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device and browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Website or Service to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, the frequency with which the Website or Service is used by a user, search terms used by a user, the links on our Website or Service that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Service and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Service by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences.

**Behavioral Targeting / Re-targeting**

We may partner with a third-party ad network or other service provider to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and Web Beacons to collect information that is not Personal Information about your activities on our Website and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests, activities, usage patterns, or general profile. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Testimonials**

We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Website in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name, User ID, and other identifying information. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us. If you provide us with comments or feedback we may collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, to send you a reply and improve our Service.

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Website and Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button, and widgets, such as the “share this” button. These features may collect your Personal Information and track your use of the Website. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. By using these tools, you acknowledge that some information from your social media services may be transmitted to us and therefore is covered by this Privacy Policy and that some information may be shared with services and would therefore be governed by their privacy policies.

**Aggregate Information**

Generally, the Service may collect and analyze usage and performance information that is not Personal Information, or that InVision aggregates or de-identifies so that it is not personally identifiable. From time to time, InVision may release this information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Service.

**Information Shared with Your Consent**

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

**Storage and Security**

We believe the security of your information is a serious issue and we are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information under our control. Notwithstanding such measures, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Service. We also are not responsible for the actions of any third parties to whom you disclose any such information.

We may transfer your information to, or maintain it on, computers located outside of your state or country, in a location having laws that are less protective of your privacy. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, be advised that InVision is located in the United States and processes your information in the United States. By using the Service under this Privacy Policy and the applicable Terms of Use, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will retain Personal Information only as long as our business needs require. We will then destroy or render unreadable any such information upon disposal. To the extent the Service requires you to provide any Financial Account Information, such as when you purchase subscriptions to the Service, that information will be collected and processed by third-party PCI-compliant service providers. We do not store Financial Account Information transmitted through the Service.

**Email Policies**

InVision may send you email relating to your User Account and the Service. We will give you the ability to opt out of marketing-related emails by logging in and changing your account settings or by clicking on a link at the bottom of each such email. In some of our communications, we use tracking means, to tell us when an email is opened or a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Website. We track this data to help us measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. You cannot opt out of receiving certain non-marketing emails regarding the Service, and you agree to receive them.

**No Responsibility for Privacy Practices of Third Parties**

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. It does not apply to products, services, or sites that are provided by or operated by third parties, even if such products, services or sites are linked or redirected to or from the Service (“Third-Party Sites”), regardless of whether or not such link or redirection is authorized by InVision. Third-Party Sites may have their own policies regarding privacy, or no policy at all.  The fact that we link to a Third-Party Site is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation that we are affiliated with that third party. InVision is not responsible for Third-Party Sites and you use them at your own risk. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and terms of the Third-Party Sites that you visit or use.

**Interactions with Others**

The Service may contain areas where you may be able to publicly post information, communicate with others, submit media content, and/or review goods, services, or vendors, such as discussion boards or blogs. Any information, including Personal Information that you post there, will be public and may be viewed by the public at large, and therefore anyone who accesses such postings will have the ability to read, collect, and further disseminate such information. We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the use, storage, or dissemination of information posted or otherwise made available on such portions of the Service. By posting Personal Information online in public forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.

**Accessing and Correcting Personal Information**

All InVision account holders may review, update, correct, or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging into their User Account. You may also contact us directly to accomplish the foregoing or if you have additional requests or questions. However, please note that removing your information may limit our ability to provide the Service to you. We must also retain certain information in order to provide you the Service. If you completely delete all such information, your User Account will be deactivated and you will lose access to the Service. Upon termination of your User Account or your request at any other time, we will take reasonable steps to provide, modify, or delete your Personal Information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law. We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, including without limitation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, where the rights of other persons would be violated, or as required by law. We will take reasonable steps to respond to all requests within 30 days (or less!).You may close an account, but InVision may nevertheless retain your Personal Information so as to protect the business interests of InVision, InVision Affiliates, vendors, and other users. Those interests include the completion of transactions, maintaining records for financial reporting purposes, complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing agreements.

**Children**

Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13, and therefore, InVision does not knowingly acquire or receive Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we later learn that any user of our Service is under the age of 13, we will take appropriate steps to remove that user’s information from our account database and will restrict that individual from future access to the Service.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy you will be notified via email (if you have an account where we have your contact information) or otherwise in some manner through the Service that we deem reasonably likely to reach you (which may include posting a new privacy policy on our Website—or a specific announcement on this page or on our blog).

Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting) or on the Effective Date set forth in the modified Privacy Policy. In all cases, your continued use of the Service or Website after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.

**Business Transfers**

InVision may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its business or assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a business deal (or the evaluation of a potential business deal) such as a merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer or successor of InVision or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website or Service of any change in ownership or resulting change in uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

**California Privacy Rights**

Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of Personal Information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the proceeding calendar year. In particular, the law provides that companies must inform consumers about the categories of Personal Information that have been shared with third parties, the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. To request a copy of the information disclosure provided by InVision pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, please contact as set forth above.
