<b>InvestorLoft.com's Privacy Statement</b>
<br>
This privacy statement covers the website http://InvestorLoft.com. InvestorLoft.com (Company) provides a variety of online services for  real estate investors and real estate professionals. Investorloft.com values your privacy, feedback and candor very highly. Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not use it or share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use this personal information at Investorloft.com to provide the best quality service possible. The following policy statement summarizes the protection and use of any personal information provided by the visitors of this site.
<br><br><br>


<b>Security of Personal Information:</b>
<br>
Client's personal information are considered to be our greatest asset and thus their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. The Company takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within both its computers and its physical premises.
<br><br>
The security of your personal information is important to the Company. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at customerservice@InvestorLoft.com.
<br><br><br>


<b>Information Collected:</b>
<br>
The Company collects user information from several areas of the website including the 'Member Signup' area (where each user's name, street address, telephone number, email address, and self-selected primary role in real estate are collected); business services; the adding and editing of property listings; the adding and editing of member profiles; IP address; email contact forms; and any inquiry forms a site user may fill out. Typical information collected includes search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. 

<br><br><br>

<b>Use of Information Collected:</b>
<br>
Collected information helps the Company better understand its users' needs in order to improve its product and service offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members with account information updates, news, and for site administration purposes. The Company may send promotional emails in the future, which users may opt-out of these email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to contact users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service, if the user has opted-in to receive such communication. User search activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized in the aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes. This information is not shared with anyone outside of the Company. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better understand traffic flows, user preferences, and to actively monitor fraudulent, illegal or aggressive activity.
<br><br><br>

<b>Use of Email Tools:</b>
<br>
You may NOT use the Email The Agent, Email Listing To a Friend, Contact A Local Professional, Ask The Expert, Tell A Friend or other email services that we offer to send spam (i.e. unsolicited email) or otherwise send content that would violate the Terms and Conditions. We may monitor, track or save the use of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track or save these email messages sent from these tools. If you send an email using the Email This Listing to a Friend or Tell A Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. This information may be stored for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of un-registered users.
<br><br><br>

<b>Shared or Public Information:</b>
<br>
Though every effort is made to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
<br><br>
Some member information is displayed in the following areas on the site: Listing Details, Professional Directory, and Professional Profiles. When a member enters a listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered and of course displayed on the listing for contact purposes regarding that listing.  In addition, members searching the website can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view Listing Details of the property. 
<br><br>
 Unless required by law as detailed in this section, or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, individual user search activity information is not shared, and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to the Company. Professional Profile users agree to share their contact information and allow all site users to view their contact information via the Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. 
<br><br><br>



<b>Opting-out, editing, updating or deleting personal information:</b>
<br>
Email transmissions are used as a vital and primary communication channel with registered users and customers. As a registered member, you hereby acknowledge and grant the Company the permission to communicate with you via email (as well as other communication channel such as phone or fax) for any purposes determined to be relevant including, but not limited to, system messages, listing inquiries, product updates, service announcements and other important messages. Best practices will be used to honor customers request to opt out of marketing messages, but under no circumstances will the Company have any liability for sending any email to its registered users/customers.
<br><br>
<i>Members are not able to un-subscribe from system messages, listing inquiries, and account update emails which contain important information.</i> The Company reserves the right to communicate with its users via email and phone to provide information about requested services and regarding issues related to their account. It is important to note that this communication is not used for marketing or promotional purposes. Requesting the deletion of certain types of user information may prevent users from accessing some web site features.
<br><br>
Users who do not wish to receive marketing emails such as the newsletter or other non-necessary promotional emails, may opt-out of this service by deselecting the email option from their member profile.  If you no longer desire our service entirely, you may deactivate your membership by sending an email to customerservice@InvestorLoft.com with 'Cancel Membership' in the subject line.
