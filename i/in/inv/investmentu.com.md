# Privacy Policy - Investment U

Investment U takes your privacy very seriously. Please take a few moments to review the steps that we _ _ take to ensure your privacy and security while you use our website.

**Cookies**

Investment U sometimes uses cookies to store and track user information. Cookies enable a personalized viewing experience on the site and enable us to recognize visitors who return after a previous visit, allowing us to customize your experience. For example, Investment U uses cookies to recognize user access privileges, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services of interest, and estimate audience size.

Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you may decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive using your web browser software. However, certain areas within the Investment U may not function as intended for users who decline to accept cookies.

In addition, advertisers that serve ads onto _ _ Investment U may also use their own cookies.

**Submitting Data**

At no time are you required to submit personal information to access any area of the Investment U _ _ site.

**Ordering Online**

Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer – an encryption protocol – and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

Investment U does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Investment U _ _ products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to acquire it.

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please click [here](https://iu.web.oxfordclub.com/contact/) to contact our customer service department.

**Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**

We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.

From time to time, we may share the email addresses we collect with trusted companies that work with or on behalf of us. This information is provided through secure, encrypted emails to reputable third parties in order to improve support and provide a better, more relevant experience for you.
