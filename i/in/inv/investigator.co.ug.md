Where the INVESTIGATOR reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), the INVESTIGATOR may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behavior.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with the INVESTIGATOR or the INVESTIGATOR’s corporate retention schedule (a database that defines which documents should be kept and for how long). If you cancel your registration as an INVESTIGATOR website member and your account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and, while the INVESTIGATOR cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.

Where you contribute material to the INVESTIGATOR we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. For example, we will only keep copies of entries to a photographic competition for the duration of the competition.

Where there is a conflict, the local terms will apply.

  3. **Cookies Policy – Information the INVESTIGATOR collects from you**



a. What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

On INVESTIGATOR websites, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our websites to your interests.

During the course of any visit to the INVESTIGATOR website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

  1. **How does the INVESTIGATOR use cookies?**



Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our education pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight educational information on your second and subsequent visits. The INVESTIGATOR uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. All third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes (see section 6 above). Certain areas of INVESTIGATOR websites may use cookies for a specific reason – for example, to help an online game work effectively on your device.

  1. **Third Party Cookies in embedded content on INVESTIGATOR pages**



Please note that during your visits to INVESTIGATOR websites you may notice some cookies that are not related to the INVESTIGATOR or the INVESTIGATOR’s contractors. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. The INVESTIGATOR does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these.

  4. **Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting**



DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. This website does not currently respond to DNT requests, however, you may opt-out of tracking on this website, including analytics (and tailored advertising if you are visiting from outside UGANDA), by changing your cookie settings.

A uniform standard has not yet been adopted to determine how DNT requests should be interpreted and what actions should be taken by websites and third parties. The INVESTIGATOR will continue to review DNT and other new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once available.

  5. **Changes to INVESTIGATOR’s Privacy Policy**



This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to the INVESTIGATOR. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use INVESTIGATOR websites to submit personal information to the INVESTIGATOR. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the website.
