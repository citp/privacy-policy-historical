The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in order to facilitate our use of that information as stated above.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. You will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless we have been negligent or in wilful default.

Please refer to [FE’s Appointed Sub-processors](http://www.financialexpress.net/appointed-sub-processors).

We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## COOKIES

A cookie is a small file containing a piece of information (a string of letters and numbers that acts as an identifier) that is placed on your browser when you visit certain websites. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies

### Types of cookies we use:

When you access our site, we ask for your consent to allow us to store the following cookies on your device.

**Essential cookies:** When you register on Investegate (to set up email alerts, for example), a cookie is placed on your browser to let us know that you are signed in (or not), and your investor type (i.e. a private investor – you will be asked this at the point of registration). The registration cookie enables our servers to determine what content you can view – that which is designated to suit your requirements and complies with various licenses we hold about the type of information we can supply to different types of investor. While you are signed in we combine information from your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have seen on Investegate. We use Google Tag Manager to manage many of our analytics and third-party cookies. We use CloudFlare to cache content on the website. We use CloudFlare for security and optimising the website’s performance – this requires CloudFlare to use cookies.

**Analytics cookies** anonymously remember your computer when you visit the website. They keep track of, for example, the number of visitors who browse the website, their browsing patterns, which country they are in and what devices is used to visit the website. We might use that information to target advertisements to you on our and other websites. 

**Advertising cookies** enable us to identify what types of adverts you have seen, for example so that you’re not shown the same advertisement too many times. We also use advertising cookies to help us use targeted advertising. We may use cookies set by other organisations so we can more accurately target advertising to you. These cookies are anonymous- they only collect information on what you have looked at on the website, not who you are. We may also set cookies on selected other sites that we advertise on in order to identify you (anonymously) as having visited those sites before or after you’ve visited the website so we can then target our advertising based on this information.

**Third party tracking cookies** which are placed by or on behalf of independent advertisers who are advertising on our site. These cookies may be placed within the advertisement and elsewhere on our site. They are anonymous – they cannot identify individuals. They are used for statistical analysis by allowing the advertiser to count how many people have seen their advertisement or have seen it more than once. They might also allow the advertiser to tailor advertising to you when you visit other websites.

**Other third-party cookies:** Other organisations may also set their own cookies in order to anonymously track your engagement and interaction with their products and services on the website. An example of this could be if you were to ‘follow’ Investegate on Twitter via a follow button on a company announcement, Twitter may place a cookie on your browser to measure this. We cannot access these cookies (likewise, these organisations cannot access cookies we place on your browser).
