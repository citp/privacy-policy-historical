<div id="content"><div class="box"><h3>InvisionFree Privacy Policy:</h3></div><br>
        <div class="box">Your privacy is important to InvisionFree. We have limited 
        the amount and types of personal information that we need from you. We 
        wish for you to be fully informed of how your information is gathered 
        and used.</div><br>
        <div class="box"><h3>What information does InvisionFree gather:</h3>
        When you register as a member on a board hosted by InvisionFree you need 
        to provide an email address, select a username, and enter a password. The 
        username you choose does not have to be your real name. Your chosen password 
        is protected by an un-reversible hash. The email address you provide can be used to allow members 
        to contact you, for InvisionFree to send important notices to you, or for certain feature of the board you visit to work. 
        You may choose to disable features that can send you emails. InvisionFree 
        also collects other information such as IP addresses and the 
        date and time of your visit. Administrators of each board do have the 
        ability to view your IP address if you post messages, visit, or register on their board.</div><br>
        <div class="box"><h3>How we use gathered information:</h3>
        The email address you provide is used by us to validate your board/account 
        registration. We may also send important notices or warnings via email. 
        InvisionFree will never sell or spam your email address. Any survey you 
        fill out is used to provide better ads or improve our services. No information 
        provided through a survey is linked to you as an individual. All other 
        information you provide is either optional or will enhance a board's features. 
        InvisionFree reserves the right to disclose any information if we believe 
        that a law has been violated. InvisionFree may transfer the information 
        in our possession if InvisionFree is sold or merges. We may disclose general 
        statistics to our sponsors and advertisers. No personal information will 
        be given to third parties. Your email address will never be given to an 
        advertiser.</div><br>
        <div class="box"><h3>How we protect your information:</h3>
        We have strict policies against spam mail being sent to you from an InvisionFree 
        free board. Many features are in place to prevent spam from being 
        sent. In addition if any member or board is caught sending spam their 
        account will be deleted. All passwords stored are encrypted and can never 
        be seen. We have taken many steps towards securing your information.</div><br>
        <div class="box"><h3>Cookies:</h3>
        Cookies are used to enhance your board visit. You may disable cookies 
        if you wish. Our ad providers may also use cookies to rotate banner ads.</div><br>
        <div class="box"><h3>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</h3>
        No user that is under 13 may register a board. To register on a board, anyone under 13 must fill out a COPPA form.. 
        We do not collect personal information from anyone known to be under 13. 
        If InvisionFree finds a user under the age of 13 providing information 
        on our site, we will delete that user and any information related to 
        that user.</div><br>
