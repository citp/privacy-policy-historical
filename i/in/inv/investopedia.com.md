If we want to use any personal information for a new purpose, we will obtain the affected individuals consent to do so, unless the new use is authorized or required by law. We will be pleased to answer your questions about our collection and use of this information. 

**Consent**  
We will obtain your consent to collect, use and disclose your personal information, except where we are authorized or required by law to do so without consent. Your consent can be given to us directly, or implied (such as by subscribing to our services), or can be provided through an authorized representative. It can be given by various means such as verbally, in writing, electronically, or through opt-out for non-sensitive information (e.g. if we notify you that we want to collect, use or disclose your personal information for various purposes and you do not object). You may withdraw consent at any time (subject to legal, contractual and other restrictions as provided by law) if you give reasonable notice in writing to us. A consequence of such notice is that, we may unable to provide certain Web Site or other services to you.

**LIMITS ON COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We will not collect personal information indiscriminately and will limit our collection of personal information to what is reasonably necessary for the purposes described.  We may also collect information as authorized by law. 

**LIMITS FOR USING AND DISCLOSING PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We will only use and disclose personal information for the purposes which are listed in this Policy, for other purposes for which we have received consent, or as are otherwise authorized or required by law. We will keep personal information used to make a decision affecting an individual for at least one year after using it to make the decision. We will destroy or make anonymous documents or other records containing personal information as soon as it is reasonable to assume that (a) the original purpose is no longer being served by retention of the information, and (b) retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes. We will take due care when destroying personal information to prevent unauthorized access to such information during its destruction process.

Investopedia will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or upon its good-faith belief that such action is necessary to cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities or comply with legal process.

Investopedia does not share any of your individual personal information with the web sites to which Investopedia links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Investopedia may share aggregate non-personally identifiable data with such websites (such as how many people use our site).

**Accuracy**  
We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information we are using is accurate and complete. In most cases, we will rely on individuals to ensure that their information, such as street address, e-mail address or telephone number, is current, complete and accurate. If individuals demonstrate the inaccuracy or incompleteness of their personal information, we will amend the information as required. If appropriate, we will send the amended information to third parties to whom the information had previously been disclosed. When a challenge by an individual regarding the accuracy of their personal information is not satisfactorily resolved, we will annotate the personal information under our control with a note that a correction was requested but not made.

**SAFEGUARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Investopedia protects the personal information in its custody or control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure or disposal, in a manner appropriate for the sensitivity of the information. Please note that confidentiality and security are not assured when information is transmitted through e-mail or wireless communication. Investopedia, through contractual or other reasonable means, tries to ensure that a comparable level of personal information protection is implemented by its suppliers, agents, and advertisers who are given access to such personal information, although absolute security cannot be guaranteed. We do always attempt to deal with reputable companies who agree to respect user privacy and applicable privacy laws.

**Proving Access**  
You have the right to access your own personal information held by Investopedia. Upon written request and authentication of identity, we will advise you of your personal information which is under Investopedia's control, the ways in which that information is being used, and the persons to whom such information may have been disclosed. We will try to make their personal information available within 45 days or provide written notice where additional time is required to fulfil the request.

In some situations, we may not be able to provide access to certain of your personal information. This may be the case where, for example, disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual, the personal information is protected by solicitor or attorney - client privilege, the information was collected for the purpose of an investigation, or where disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that, could harm our competitive position. We may also be prevented by law from providing access to certain personal information. Where an access request is refused Investopedia will provide notice in writing, giving the reason for refusal and outlining further steps which are available to challenge such a decision.

Upon request, we will provide information regarding our Privacy Policy complaint procedures.
