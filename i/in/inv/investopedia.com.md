We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

For example, we may ask you for information, such as your e-mail address, title and industry when you register to become a member of Investopedia. You may also provide information to Investopedia in other contexts, including, for example, in order to register for the Stock Simulator or to enter into a sweepstakes or promotion. In the event you order something from Investopedia or one of our co-branded websites, we may request additional personal information, such as your address, telephone number and payment information, in order to complete the purchase. In order to further enhance the website user experience and target content to users’ interests, we may also supplement the data you provide to us with data from data append services (where other information may be added to the information you provide). You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Investopedia website, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.

A cookie is a small data file that is written to your computer's hard drive by your web browser. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that a website will use to track the pages and number of times you have visited. Investopedia uses cookies to track web and advertising analytics throughout Investopedia and its affiliate websites and to remember your custom video playlists, preferences, job title, story ratings (if you have provided any), and membership status so that you don't have to login each time you visit the website. The data read from these cookies may be linked to personally identifying (PII) and non-personally identifying (non-PII) information.

This information is automatically logged by most websites.

**Widgets**

Widgets are small content modules that users can embed on their own sites. We offer widgets that are hosted on Investopedia, like our embeddable video player, as well as widgets that are powered by 3rd party vendors. Use of the Investopedia widgets is subject to the Investopedia [terms of use](http://www.investopedia.com/corp/termsofuse.aspx), but downloading or embedding these widgets on other websites is not covered by this privacy statement.

We may also make reasonable geographic and demographic assumptions based on your presented IP address to target relevant content and advertising.

The Non-PII collected by such parties on our Site and other websites may be used in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

We use third parties to provide processing, e-mail service providers and hosting services on our site. When you are on an area of Investopedia and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Investopedia as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Investopedia. When you sign up for such services, we will share your personally identifiable information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service.

In addition, if you provide any personally identifiable information via an advertiser promotion, please be aware you are directly providing your personally identifiable information to that advertiser.

Contests or Surveys

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you, such as your name and e-mail. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this personally identifiable information to notify contest winners and award prizes. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

Email Referral

We also have features that allow you to send an e-mail to yourself and/or others about an item on our site. If you choose to use our e-mail referral service, you will be required to provide the e-mail address or addresses that will be used in the notification. Upon form submission an e-mail will be generated to your recipient(s) inviting them to visit the URL you have recommended. We do not store this information other than for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

Investopedia derives the majority of its revenue from advertising and sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.

We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.

**As Necessary to Provide Services to You**  
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service. In some instances these companies may collect information directly from you (such as for credit card processing for the purchase of investment newsletters). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider. In all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

**In The Event of Sale or Bankruptcy**  
The ownership of Investopedia may change at some point in the future. Should that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in control of Investopedia your information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site. Opting out of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be respected regarding the use of your information. You will be notified as described below in "How will I know if the Privacy Policy is changed."

**As Required By Law**  
Investopedia may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on Investopedia or to protect and defend the rights or property of Investopedia.

**Security**  
Your information is stored on Investopedia's servers located in the United States. We use industry standard procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and you acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us.

Data Processing/Safe Harbor

FOR EUROPEAN UNION AND SWISS CITIZENS.  
The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from U.S. laws. To reconcile these differences, the U.S. and the EU have created a safe harbor (“U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework”) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. The U.S. and Switzerland have created a similar safe harbor (“U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework”). For more information see [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).

Investopedia complies with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit 

[http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).

In compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, Investopedia commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Investopedia at 

[suggestion@investopedia.com](mailto:suggestion@investopedia.com)

Investopedia has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Investopedia please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR website at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint.

**Privacy of Children**  
Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us, including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.
