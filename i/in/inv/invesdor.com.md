### Data Security

Invesdor applies appropriate technical measures to ensure the security of Your Personal Information. Such measures include the following:

The database where the Personal Information is stored is operated in a locked environment, to which only authorized personnel has access. A certain part of the Personal Information is encrypted. However, despite the technical security measures taken by Invesdor, the use of the Internet and submission of Personal Information is always associated with risks and no system or measure is completely safe. Especially, the "Beta" trial version of the service may contain such software faults, which may weaken the Data Security. Therefore, if You choose to register to the "Beta" trial version of the Service, You must be prepared to accept a higher risk with respect to Data Security. Invesdor recommends that You always use caution when submitting any Personal Information on the Internet.
