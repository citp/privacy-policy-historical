tracking technologies such as cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey.
We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems
and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not constitute
personal information, the APPs do not apply and we may use this information in ways not covered by this Policy.
We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or at least limit the personal
information that you publish or communicate, to the public via our services, such as in our forums or blogs

your Non-Confidential Information. You agree that we may use and disclose Non-Confidential Information for any
purpose and by any means whatsoever.
How we collect personal information
We collect personal information directly from you whenever practical, and for example, may collect your personal
information when you request or acquire a product or service from us, register or subscribe with us as a member,
provide a product or service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or event, contribute
in a fundraising event, participate in our services (including our radio programs, blogs and forums) or when you
communicate with us by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example, if you contact customer service to make
a complaint or provide feedback). We may also collect your personal information from a variety of third party
sources, such as advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners.
If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you
have that person’s consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.
Why we collect personal information
The primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to provide you with products and services you
have requested. We also collect information about you for the purposes outlined below. We may state a more
specific purpose at the point we collect your information. If you do not provide us with the information that we
request, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services. For example, if you do not register as a
member of a website, you will not be able to access features or services that are reserved for members only.
How we use personal information
In addition to the primary purpose outlined above, we may use the personal information we collect, and you
consent to us using your personal information:
•     to provide you with news and information about our products and services;
•     to send marketing and promotional material that we believe you may be interested in. This material may relate
      to any business conducted by us or a third party business which we believe may be of interest to you;
•     for purposes necessary or incidental to the provision of goods and services to you;
•     to personalise and customise your experiences;
•     to manage and enhance our products and services;
•     to communicate with you, including by email, mail or telephone;

•     to investigate any complaints about or made by you, or if we have reason to suspect that you are in breach of
      any of our terms and conditions or that you are or have been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity;

•     as required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act)
In some circumstances, the law may permit or require us to use or disclose personal information for other purposes
(for instance where you would reasonably expect us to and the purpose is related to the purpose of collection).
How we disclose personal information
We will disclose your personal information, and you consent to us disclosing your personal information, to
InvestSMART Group Ltd and to any of its related entities (in which case, your personal information will be
collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with this Policy). We may also disclose personal
information, and you consent to us disclosing your personal information, to third parties:
•     engaged by us to perform functions or provide products and services on our behalf, such as processing credit
      card information, mailouts, financial recovery, marketing, research and advertising;
•     that are our agents, business partners or joint venture entities or partners;
•     that sponsor or promote any competition that we conduct or promote via our services;
•     authorised by you to receive information held by us;
•     as part of any investigation into you or your activity, for example, if we have reason to suspect that you have
      committed a breach of any of our terms and conditions, or have otherwise been engaged in any unlawful
      activity, and we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to the Police, any relevant authority or
      enforcement body, or your Internet Service Provider or network administrator;
•     as part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all or part of our business; and/or
•     as required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act).
We store your personal information in Australia, though some of our multinational service suppliers may store this
information overseas. We are unable to determine in which countries this information may be held. We are unlikely
to disclose your personal information overseas.
As mandated by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (Commissioner), if an eligible data breach
occurs which causes serious harm to an individual, InvestSMART Group Ltd will have to notify the Commissioner of
such a breach. This requirement is known as the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, effective 22nd February 2018.
Your personal details may be provided to the Commissioner and the individual themselves will be notified of the
matter, should such an occurrence arise.
Opting out
You may “opt out” from receiving communications from us or from third parties that send communications to
you in accordance with this Policy. For example, you may unsubscribe from e-newsletters and other marketing
or promotional material sent by us. You may “opt out” from receiving these communications by clicking on the
unsubscribe link at the end of an email, or by updating your personal details on our websites, or by contacting us

Management and security
We have appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee the management of personal information in accordance with this
Policy and the Privacy Act. Other than in relation to Non-Confidential Information, we will take all reasonable steps
to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, interference or unauthorised access, including
by means of appropriate physical measure and appropriate electronic measures such as firewalls, pass word access,
secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.
However, you acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of communications sent by
electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed. You provide information to us via the internet or by post at
your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal
information where the security of information is not within our control. You acknowledge that we are not
responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party (including third parties that we are permitted to

of your information by such third party/ies may be subject to separate privacy and security policies. If you suspect

any of the channels disclosed in the Contacting us, complaints and feedback section below.
Accessing and correcting your information
We take reasonable steps to ensure only required data is held and that all personal information is complete and
accurate. We request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our
service to you.
Subject to some exceptions in the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access the personal information we hold
about you. If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. We may charge a fee to cover
the costs of meeting your request, for example cancelling and re-issuing a cheque payment sent to an out-dated
address. If we refuse your request for access, we will give you written reasons within a reasonable time (unless it
would be unreasonable to provide those reasons).
If you are registered with us as a member, you are able to change and update your profile at any time. Should you

and feedback section below and we will consider your request to correct the information. We will usually correct
your information within a reasonable time. If we refuse to correct your personal information, we will provide you with
a written notice that sets out the reasons for our refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons)
and provide you with a statement regarding the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint.
