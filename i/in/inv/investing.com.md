### What Information Does Investing.com Collect?

We collect two types of data and information from you:

**(1)Non-Personal Information** \- Investing.com retains some non-personally identifiable information (“Non-Personal Information”), such as your approximate geo-location, your web request, browser type, browser language, web pages you visit before or after visiting our Website or using the App, URLs, platform type, click numbers, landing pages, viewed pages and the order of those pages and time spent on pages. This information is collected and retained for security reasons and so that we can audit and statistically track usage, audit our affiliates, and calculate payments to third parties.

“Cookies” - Non-Personal Information is collected, inter alia, through the use of cookies, so when accessing or using the Website, we may use one or more cookies. Cookies are small text files, placed on a user's device, which enable a website to remember user preferences. Detailed information about cookies and how we use them on the Website and other websites implementing our web tools may be found in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/about-us/cookie-policy), which also describes how you can turn off cookies or control them.

Web Beacons - We also use a software technology called “clear gifs” (also known as Web Beacons). Web Beacons are small pieces of code placed on a website to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a “cookie” to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.

**(2)Personal Information** \- “Personal Information” is information that may be of a private or sensitive nature, including your name, gender, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, and IP address.

Some of the Personal Information is collected from you when you create an account (“Account”) on the Service (which may be required in order to access certain services or programs via the Service) and submit your information. You are also able to create an Account using your credentials with a designated third party website or service ("Third Party Account"), such as Facebook® or Google®. Doing so will enable you to link your Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear which you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will obtain from, and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account. Such information includes your Personal Information stored on this Third Party Account, such as user name, email address, profile picture, gender, birthday and preferences.

We treat any Non-Personal Information which is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information as Personal Information.

### Mandatory and Optional Information

In order to access our services, users may be asked to fill in a form, providing some personal information to the Company. Answers to questions on Personal Information are not mandatory unless the fields are marked with an asterisk. Provision of the information requested in the optional fields of the registration form is not mandatory in order to receive the services and information that we provide through the Site (unless otherwise indicated in the registration form). However, failure to complete mandatory fields or providing incorrect Personal Information may prevent us from fully providing the requested information or services.

We use cookies in conjunction with third parties to collect user information. Your Personal Information is collected to enable us to provide you with features, capabilities, offers and marketing materials we or our marketing partners think you may be interested in.

In addition to the above, your Personal Information allows us to provide you with technical assistance and support.

### Who Else Receives this Information?

We may share or transfer information, including Personal Information, internally within our group of companies.

We also share Personal and Non-Personal Information with third parties, when this is required in order to provide, maintain or improve our services and operation.

Any processing performed by any of our third party service providers ("Recipients") will, where required by law, be governed by a data processing agreement in the form required by law, preserving any and all of your statutory data protection rights and obligating the Recipients to respect the Personal Information and handle it in accordance with the relevant laws. The Recipients are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use your Personal Information only in the course of providing the aforementioned services and only for the purposes that Fusion Media dictates.

We may also share your Personal Information and other information in special cases if we have a good reason to believe that it is necessary to: (i) comply with law, regulation, subpoena or court order; (ii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, violation of our policies or technical issues; (iii) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any other agreements between you and Fusion Media, including investigation of potential violations thereof; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of the Company, its partners, its affiliates, users or the public.

We may share your email address and phone number with our marketing partners and may periodically use it ourselves for the purpose of providing you with marketing offers. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers by following the on-page instructions at <http://www.investing.com/unsubscribe>. If you unsubscribe we will remove your email address from our marketing distribution lists and from any future lists we may share with our marketing partners. However, you may need to separately unsubscribe from marketing offers sent by our marketing partners.

### Use of Information

The collection and processing of Personal Information is aimed at providing you with services offered by the Website, to send you marketing offers on products or services we think may be relevant to you, and to fulfill other purposes as provided in this privacy policy.

### Security and Confidentiality

The Company treats your Personal Information in strict confidentiality, and the server in which this data is to be stored includes the necessary industry-standard security measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, we cannot completely guarantee the security of your information, which might be accessed, disclosed, modified, or destroyed, and it should be emphasized that you share this information at your own risk.

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service, and to our web tools which are integrated or implemented in other third party websites. The Policy does not apply to third party websites, linked to our Website. Third party websites or services may have their own privacy policies and we advise you to read them carefully.

Third party sites may contain information or services that are illegal or that some people may find inappropriate or offensive. Before using third party sites and services or before making a purchase, we recommend that you read and understand the privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third party websites and services, and the warranties for purchased products. You are knowingly and voluntarily assuming all risks of using third party sites to purchase products and services. You acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such third party sites and your use of them.

### Assignment

We may transfer or assign your information, without any notice, and without a need to receive your consent, to any third party as a result of change of control, consolidation, merger, acquisition or reorganization. You acknowledge that in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, we may have no control over the use and transfer of your Personal Information.
