**Information The Company Collects**

The Company is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors.

The Company does not share any information with anyone outside our company. The Company only collects personal details to give customers access to the services of this Website, for email communication with an option to opt-out, and for billing purposes.

When you visit the Website, your browser automatically sends us an IP (Internet Protocol) address and certain other information (including the type of browser you use). The Company may use this IP address and other information to give you access to the Website and otherwise administer the Website. In certain parts of the Website, the Company may ask you to provide your name or other information so that the Company can provide you with information you request, consider your application for registering with us, or take other action indicated in the part of the Website where the information is requested.

Each browser is different; so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. However, you must enable cookies from the Website in order to use most functions on the Website.

Information recorded through web beacons is used to report anonymous individual and/or aggregate information about our users. Aggregate information may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners or third parties from this research. You may choose to opt-out of our using this information.

Please note that the Company cannot guarantee the security of member account information, no system is 100% secure, especially any which includes transmission of data over the Internet, and unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.
