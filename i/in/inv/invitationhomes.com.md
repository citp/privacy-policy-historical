# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 16, 2017

Your privacy is important to Invitation Homes and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively referred to as “Invitation Homes,” “us,” “our,” or “we”). We published this Privacy Policy so you (the “User”) know how we collect, use, and share your personal information.

This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and applications (“Sites”) that link to this Privacy Policy.

We may revise and update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will post the updated Privacy Policy to the Site. If these changes are material (i.e., changes we believe you will find important), we will provide notice to you by email or by posting notice of the changes on our affected Sites. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. **UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY WILL APPLY IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING TO THE SITE.**

**1\. YOUR INFORMATION**

**a. Personal Information You Give Us**  
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. We collect and may transmit personal information that you provide to us through the Site (“Your Information”). For example, we collect your name, address, phone number, email address, and payment information when you sign up for our services in order for us to provide you with access to the services. Your Information may include, without limitation, (i) contact data (such as a User’s name, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) demographic data (such as a User’s zip code, age, profession and income); (iii) financial information collected to process purchases made from us via the Site or otherwise (such as credit card, debit card or other payment information); (iv) other information requested during the account registration process; and (v) other information requested during your use of features, products and services of the Site (such as vehicle information, license plate numbers, pet information, or emergency contacts). If a User communicates with us by e-mail or otherwise, posts messages to any forums, completes online forms, surveys or entries or otherwise interacts with or uses the features on the Site, any information provided in such communications may be collected by us.

**b. Information We Collect Automatically**  
Whenever you interact with the Site (whether via a browser, an application, or otherwise), we automatically receive and record or log information from your browser. Other information collected automatically may include your IP address, the type of browser or application you are using to access the Site, and the identity of the Site page or feature you are requesting. We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, and gather broad demographic data for aggregate use. We may also collect information regarding the device(s) you use to access or use the Site.

To collect this information, we may use “cookies” or other tracking and logging technologies to track how you use the Site. We also may send instructions to your computer or device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Site. A cookie is a file stored on your computer or device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your computer or device. If applicable, our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser, application, or mobile device when you click on ads that appear on the Site. Clicking on a link to a third party website from our Site may also allow that third party website to also transmit cookies to you.

We may also use “web beacons”, i.e. “web bugs” or “single–pixel” or “clear” GIFs, on the Site. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website.  
You may adjust your web browser software if you do not wish to receive cookies or web beacons, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of the Site’s features. Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Be sure to review the privacy policy of any third party website you visit because this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or web beacons by any third parties. You may also request to opt-out of an advertiser’s use of cookies by visiting the National Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. You may request to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting www.google.com/ads/preferences. All applicable terms on these websites will apply to your request to opt-out in addition to this Privacy Policy.

**2\. HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION**

**a. Non-Personal Information**  
We may use and share non-personal, de-identified information (i.e. information that cannot be used to identify you) for any lawful business purpose without any obligation or accounting to you. For example, we can use non-personal information for developing products, services, and providing those offerings to other users and third parties. We may use your personal information to generate non-personal information (e.g., by statistically aggregating your personal information with the information of others). When we do so, we will take reasonable measures to ensure that the non-personal information is no longer personally identifiable and cannot later be used to identify you. We may also disclose non-personal, aggregate, anonymous data in a de-identified format to investors and potential partners based on information collected from users.

**b. Personal Information**  
We may use and disclose Your Information collected through the Site (i) to perform the services described on the Site; and (ii) to contact you regarding our services. We may combine and enhance Your Information with information we receive from third parties as long as we use the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also use information collected through the Site for research regarding the effectiveness of the Site and our business planning, marketing, advertising, and sales efforts.

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and we may need to share Your Information with them to provide services to you. Unless we tell you differently, they do not have any right to use Your Information beyond what is necessary to assist us.

We may also disclose Your Information at the request of law enforcement or government agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process to establish, protect, or exercise our legal or other rights or to defend against a legal claim or as otherwise required or allowed by law. We may disclose Your Information in order to protect the rights, property, or safety of a user or any other person. We may disclose Your Information to investigate or prevent a violation by you of any contractual or other relationship with us or your illegal or harmful activity.

**3\. PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Information about you that is maintained on our systems is protected using industry standard technical and organizational security measures. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on or transmitted from its systems will be completely secure. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures relating to the Site by any Users or third parties. Protecting your account login credentials (i.e. your username and password) from unauthorized access is your responsibility. You may not share your login credentials with any third party. We recommend you log out after accessing your account, change your password on a periodic basis, and limit access to your computer or device and its browser. While we use commercially reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing our files or tampering with the Site, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful. Your Information may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to or from us. We cannot and do not guarantee the total privacy or security of any information you transmit through the Site.

**4\. RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION; MODIFICATION**

**a. Correcting, Updating, Accessing or Removing Personal Information**  
If a User’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a User no longer desires to receive non-account specific information from us, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update and/or remove that User’s previously-provided personal data. This can be done by emailing a request to us at [info@invitationhomes.com](mailto:info@invitationhomes.com). Additionally, you may request access to the personally identifiable information as collected by us by sending a request to us as set forth above. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may not be able to completely remove a User’s information from its systems. For example, we may retain a User’s personal information for legitimate business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for account recovery purposes, if required by law or as retained in our data backup systems or cached or archived pages. All retained personally identifiable information will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which the User has previously agreed.

**b. Your California Privacy Rights**  
California law permits users that are residents of California to request the following information regarding our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes (i) a list of certain categories of personal information that we have disclosed to certain third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year; (ii) the identity of certain third parties that received personal information from us for their direct marketing purposes during that calendar year; and (iii) examples of the products or services marketed (if we have that information). If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please email us at [info@invitationhomes.com](mailto:info@invitationhomes.com).

The California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”) requires COMPANY to disclose how it responds to Do Not Track signals set in a User’s browser. We support Do No Track browser settings. If you enable Do Not Track privacy settings in the browser you are using, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to stop collecting the information that allows us to tailor the Sites to User preferences based on Users recent use of the Sites or services. Consequently, we will not store or use information about any other websites you visit, other than our Sites.

**6\. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES**

The Site may include or provide links to other websites on the Internet that we do not control. Even if an affiliation exists between us and a third party website, each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. While we expect our customers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to consult that website’s privacy policy before providing Your Information to it and whenever interacting with any website.

**7\. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION THROUGH BUSINESS TRANSFERS**

We may buy, merge, or partner with other companies or businesses and in so doing, acquire or transfer information. Your Information collected through the Site may be among the transferred business assets. In the event that a portion or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, Your Information would likely be a transferred business asset, and you hereby agree to such a transfer.

**8\. USERS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES**

The Site is hosted in the United States and is governed by United States law. If you are using the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.

**9\. NO CHILDREN**
