# InvisionFree Privacy Policy

### What information does InvisionFree gather:

When you register as a member on a board hosted by InvisionFree you need to provide an email address, select a username, and enter a password. The username you choose does not have to be your real name. Your chosen password is protected by an un-reversible hash. The email address you provide can be used to allow members to contact you, for InvisionFree to send important notices to you, or for certain feature of the board you visit to work. You may choose to disable features that can send you emails. InvisionFree also collects other information such as IP addresses and the date and time of your visit. Administrators of each board do have the ability to view your IP address if you post messages, visit, or register on their board. 

### How we use gathered information:

The email address you provide is used by us to validate your board/account registration. We may also send important notices or warnings via email. InvisionFree will never sell or spam your email address. Any survey you fill out is used to provide better ads or improve our services. No information provided through a survey is linked to you as an individual. All other information you provide is either optional or will enhance a board's features. InvisionFree reserves the right to disclose any information if we believe that a law has been violated. InvisionFree may transfer the information in our possession if InvisionFree is sold or merges. We may disclose general statistics to our sponsors and advertisers. No personal information will be given to third parties. Your email address will never be given to an advertiser. 

### How we protect your information:

We have strict policies against spam mail being sent to you from an InvisionFree free board. Many features are in place to prevent spam from being sent. In addition if any member or board is caught sending spam their account will be deleted. All passwords stored are encrypted and can never be seen. We have taken many steps towards securing your information. 

### Cookies:

Cookies are used to let you log into your account. Our ad providers may also use cookies to rotate banner ads. 

### Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):

No user that is under 13 may register a board. To register on a board, anyone under 13 must fill out a COPPA form. We do not collect personally identifiable information from anyone known to be under 13. If InvisionFree finds a user under the age of 13 providing personally identifiable information on our site, we will delete that user and/or any information related to that user.
