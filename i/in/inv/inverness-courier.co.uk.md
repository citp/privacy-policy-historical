**Introduction**

By accessing and using our website or other services, you are agreeing to the terms of this policy and our privacy policy. Please do read these policies carefully so you know what we are doing with your information.

We may update this cookie policy from time to time and will post any changes on our website at [www.inverness-courier.co.uk](http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/) so it's a good idea to come back occasionally and read through it again. This cookie policy was last updated on 24 May 2012.

Cookies are small files of letters and numbers. These files are either stored in the memory of your computer or other device such as mobile phones or tablet devices (these cookies are generally known as session cookies) or are placed on the hard drive of your device (generally known as persistent cookies).

Cookies are created when you visit a website that uses cookies. Cookies are commonly used by websites to help the user's browsing experience and provide more information about the user's experience and interests. This information is generally used to make content, services and advertising more relevant and useful during future visits.

For more details about cookies and details of how to delete and disable cookies you can visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) and also see our section on more information and turning cookies off below.

Our website [www.inverness-courier.co.uk](http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/) uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website and to provide increased functionality when you are using our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website and our services.

Unless you have adjusted your browser settings to refuse cookies, our systems will issue cookies as soon you visit our website or access other services. If you have switched off cookies then some of the functionality of our website or services may not be available to you.

Please note that not all the cookies on our sites are set by us but we have indicated in this policy where cookies are set by third parties.

The cookies on our website are mainly functional and analytical cookies.

_**Analytical cookies**_

Analytical cookies allow us to recognise and to count the number of visitors to our website, to see how visitors move around the website when they are using it and to record which content viewers view and are interested in. This helps us to determine how frequently particular pages and advertisements are visited and to determine the most popular areas of our website and/or services. This helps us to improve the service which we offer to you by helping us make sure our users are finding the information they are looking for, by providing anonymised demographic data to third parties in order to target advertising more appropriately to you, and by tracking the success of advertising campaigns on our website.

_**Functional cookies**_

Functional cookies relate to the functionality of our website and allow us to improve the services we offer to you through our website, for example:

  * by recording your opinion or action (e.g. where you have voted in a poll);
  * by allowing you to carry information across pages of our website to avoid you having to re-enter information or interact more quickly;
  * to allow you to access stored information if you have registered with us;
  * by recognising your preferences when you return to our website(s);
  * by enabling us to serve the appropriate regionalised service relevant to your location; or
  * by ensuring that any adverts which you view on our website are not repeated within a short space of time.
