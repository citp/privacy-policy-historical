<p>At <em>InvestorPlace.com</em>, we take the privacy and security of our registered users and subscribers seriously. We are committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Accordingly, we have adopted the following privacy policy, based on the principles of notice, choice, access and security in the collection and use of all information regarding our customers and their activities at <em>InvestorPlace</em> and our related sites.</p>
<font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Collection of Information </strong></font>
<p><strong> Registration and subscription data</strong> are the only personally identifiable information that <em>InvestorPlace</em> seeks about you. This information includes your email address and, in some cases, your name, mailing address, telephone number or fax number. </p>
<p>We collect no information about our users that is not supplied voluntarily through web forms or email. We may at times collect anonymous tracking information to gauge usage patterns and the popularity of specific areas of our sites. As with all other information, this information is kept confidential for use only by employees of <em>InvestorPlace.com</em> and Phillips International.</p>
<p>Some of these data are collected through the use of cookies. Cookies may be deactivated by the user at any time through features available on your Internet browser. They are not required for any <em>InvestorPlace.com</em> site to function properly. Transparent gifs or pixels may occasionally be used for the same purpose, but these items gather no personal information and have no effect on how you view our sites or how you navigate the site.

<p>All of our e-letters, alerts and special notices from our advisors and partners are sent only to those who have specifically agreed to our opt in policy. Unsubscribe instructions are included at the bottom of each email. Some e-letter issues include advertising, clearly marked as such. By registering to receive our email from <em>InvestorPlace</em>, you also agree to receive email announcements and special offers from our partners. If you are a subscriber to our investment newsletters, you will also receive information regarding your newsletter author’s site and/or service. Occasionally, we may write to you at your email address with offers from carefully screened companies that offer products, services or information we believe may be of interest to you. </p>
<p> We neither rent nor sell your email address to anyone. Though we hope you gain value from the messages you receive, you can choose to opt out of receiving further messages by following the instructions provided at the close of each email.

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> Your Mailing Address </strong></font></p>
<p> We collect your postal address as part of the order process. We use it to send you the free special reports you have requested, newsletters that you have purchased and special offers from Phillips International, Inc<em>.</em> We may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of our subscribers to carefully screened companies who offer products, services or information which we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want to hear from our carefully selected partners, <a href="http://www.investorplace.com/ipi/p/?pc=UNSPRI">click here</a> or send a copy of your mailing label to Phillips Investment Resources, 7811 Montrose Rd., Potomac MD 20854, Attention: Subscription Services. Any other information you provide us, such as your fax or telephone number, is collected by us only to fulfill subscription orders that you have purchased or to contact you about our <em>InvestorPlace</em> affiliated services. <strong></strong></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> Making a Purchase Through InvestorPlace</strong></font></p>
<p> When you purchase a newsletter service online from us, we will request certain personal information, including your name, postal address, daytime and evening telephone numbers, and credit card number (where applicable) only for the purposes of contact you about your <em>InvestorPlace</em> family of services. Individuals who do not have a Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express credit card are not permitted to make purchases online. </p>
<p> When you purchase a newsletter or other service through <em>InvestorPlace</em>, you will also receive relevant bulletins from your newsletter author, announcements of new web content, and information on new services provided by your newsletter author. We may also use your email address to contact you with questions about your subscription or service, or to remind you of your site password, if necessary. </p>
<p> Your personal information is not shared with third parties other than as described above. </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> <font size="3">How can you be sure that your information is secure</font></strong><font size="3"><strong>?</strong></font></font></p>
<p> We take the security of your personal information quite seriously and are constantly improving our efforts to protect it. However, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secured. Though we take great care to protect your personal information, <em>InvestorPlace</em> cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, including your portfolios on PortfolioGrader.com, and you do so at your own risk. We do not share your credit card number with other parties, other than those involved with the administration of your subscription. We do not share other information except as described in this policy. </p>
<p> If any unauthorized use of your credit card occurs as a result of your credit card purchase from <em>InvestorPlace</em>, simply notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If, through no fault of your own, your credit card company finds credit card fraud as a result of your credit card purchase from <em>InvestorPlace</em> but does not waive your entire liability for unauthorized charges, we will reimburse you for the remaining liability, up to a maximum of fifty U.S. dollars ($50.00) per card. You can also take steps to secure your personal information. When you are finished at <em>InvestorPlace.com</em>, sign off the <em>InvestorPlace</em> site and close your browser window. This helps to ensure that someone else cannot pose as you online. This is especially important if you are at a computer that is accessible to others in a public place, such as a library, a school or your office. </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> <font size="3">How can you use the information found at InvestorPlace</font></strong><font size="3"><strong>?</strong></font></font></p>

Any other reproduction, transmission, performance, display or editing of these materials by any means, mechanical or electronic, without the express written permission of Phillips Investment Resources is strictly prohibited.

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> <font size="3">What happens in the event of a merger or acquisition</font></strong><font size="3"><strong>?</strong></font></font></p>
<p> Phillips Investment Resources is a dynamic investment advisory service publisher. As our business continues to develop and grow, it is possible that we might sell or buy other publishers, advisory services, products or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Phillips Investment Resources, or a substantial part or all of its assets (including <em>InvestorPlace.com</em>) are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> <font size="3">What about advertising</font></strong><font size="3"><strong>?</strong></font></font></p>
<p><em> InvestorPlace</em> features several services that are co-sponsored by other web sites. One example of such a feature is the quote service. Additionally, our site contains links to other web sites, including those of advertisers. We are not responsible for the claims or representations made by advertisers or sponsors. While these co-sponsored activities, banner ads and links originate on <em>InvestorPlace</em>, we do not operate them. For example, if you click on a link or banner advertisement, that click takes you out of <em>InvestorPlace</em> to either the service or ad provider's site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. Since we do not have control over the privacy practices or the content of these sites, we recommend that you check their privacy policies before giving out any personal information. <em>InvestorPlace</em> and Phillips Investment Resources, LLC do not own, control, have access to, or maintain any information collected by our co-sponsors or advertisers. </p>
<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We hope this Privacy Statement has explained what we do with the personal information that we collect from you, our views and practices regarding personal information and how they affect you as you use our features and services, and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>
