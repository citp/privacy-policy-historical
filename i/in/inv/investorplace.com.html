At <i>InvestorPlace.com</i>, we take the privacy and security of our registered users and subscribers seriously.  We are committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us.  Accordingly, we have adopted the following privacy policy, based on the principles of notice, choice, access and security in the collection and use of all information regarding our customers and their activities at <i>InvestorPlace</i> and our related sites.
<p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
<b><i>What infomation do we collect?</i></b>
</font>
</p><p>
At InvestorPlace we collect two types of information from our registered users and subscribers:
</p><p>
1. site usage data<br>
2. registration and subscription data
</p><p>
<b>Site usage data </b>is information we collect to measure how our registered users and customers use <i>InvestorPlace</i> and our related sites. From time to time, <i>InvestorPlace</i> may perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior, but they are not based on any personal information that you provide, nor are they personally identifiable. These analyses allow us to measure your interest in our site, and help us in several key areas.  The most important of these are:
</p><ul>
<li>Improving our web content
</li><li>Enhancing your experience while visiting the site
</li><li>Customizing the content and/or layout of our pages
</li><li> Providing services required by individual users
</li><li> Developing new products based on your needs
</li></ul>
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
<b><i>What are "cookies"? How do we use them?</i></b>
</font>
<p>
Like many other commercial sites, <i>InvestorPlace</i> utilizes a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a web site recognize you as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that you may have set (including remembering your password if desired).  A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus or capture your e-mail address. Cookies on our site may collect your domain name and track your selections through our web pages. 
</p><p>
We only use "cookies" to gather the information indicated in this policy and do not use cookies to gather personal information about you without your consent. We may disclose this information, in aggregate form only, to third parties including advertisers or potential advertisers.  <i>DoubleClick</i>, the organization that delivers advertising to our site, uses cookies from <i>InvestorPlace</i> to collect information for tracking purposes. None of this information can be associated with you personally. You may always disable cookies from being set by changing your browser preferences. (See Advertising section below for a further description of <i>DoubleClick's</i> information collection practices and how you may opt-out.)
</p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
<b><i>What about advertising?</i></b>
</font>
</p><p>
<i>InvestorPlace</i> features several services that are co-sponsored by other web sites. One example of such a feature is the portfolio registration and quote service. Additionally, our site contains links to other web sites, including those of advertisers. While these co-sponsored activities, banner ads and links originate on <i>InvestorPlace</i>, we do not operate them. For example, if you click on a link or banner advertisement, that click takes you out of <i>InvestorPlace</i> to either the service or ad provider's site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. Since we do not have control over the privacy practices or the content of these sites, we recommend that you check their privacy policies before giving out any personal information. <i>InvestorPlace</i> does not own, control, have access to, or maintain any information collected by our co-sponsors or advertisers. 
</p><p>
<i>InvestorPlace</i> also partners with <i>DoubleClick</i> to provide you with advertisements we believe will add value to your service.  In the course of delivering an ad to you, <i>DoubleClick</i> does not collect any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. <i>DoubleClick</i> does, however, use cookies (see above for a discussion of "cookies") to collect information that cannot be associated with you personally. This information includes the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. The collection of this information is commonly referred to as "tracking."  <i>DoubleClick</i> uses this information for the purpose of targeting meaningful ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of <i>InvestorPlace</i>. For more information regarding the methods and technology used to collect this information, how <i>DoubleClick</i> uses it, who gets access to it and what measures are taken to secure the data obtained, please view <i>DoubleClick's</i> privacy policy found at <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy">http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy</a>. 
</p><p>
<i>DoubleClick</i> also conducts statistical analyses that help us determine the value of the ads we provide to you.  <i>InvestorPlace</i> may share this aggregate information with advertisers or potential advertisers.  You can opt-out of <i>DoubleClick</i> tracking by clicking the following link: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy">http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy</a>. (Scroll down to the middle of the page and click on the "opt-out" graphic.) Doing so will opt you out of all tracking conducted by <i>DoubleClick</i> for your browser. If you surf through other browsers or on other machines, you will have to set this option there as well. So, if you use multiple browsers (AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.) you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly, if you connect to the web from multiple machines (e.g. work and home) you need to explicitly opt-out from each browser on each machine.
</p><p>
<i>InvestorPlace's</i> privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to current law or government regulation.
</p><p>
<b>Registration and subscription data</b> is the only personally identifiable information that <i>InvestorPlace</i> seeks about you.  This information includes your e-mail address and, in some cases, your name, mailing address, telephone number or fax number.
</p><p>
We collect your <b>e-mail address</b> as part of the <i>InvestorPlace</i> registration process, or when you place an order through InvestorPlace.  We use it to send you investment information and timely financial news.  From time to time, we will also send you additional information including special offers from <i>InvestorPlace</i> or specially selected partners.  If you are a subscriber to our investment newsletters, you will receive information regarding your newsletter author's site.  Our Client Relations representatives may also contact you if they have any questions about your subscription or service.
 </p><p>
We neither rent nor sell your email address to anyone. Though we hope you gain value from the messages you receive, you can choose to opt-out of receiving further messages by following the instructions provided at the close of each e-mail.  You may also opt-out of receiving future messages by e-mailing your request to <a href="mailto:phillipsunsub@phillips.com">phillipsunsub@phillips.com</a>.

We collect your <b>postal address</b> as part of the order process. We use it to send you the free special reports you have requested, newsletters that you have purchased and special offers from <i>Phillips International, Inc.</i>  Occasionally, we may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of our subscribers to carefully screened companies who offer products, services, or information which we believe may be of interest to you.  You may "opt-out" of receiving this information by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:phillipsunsub@phillips.com">phillipsunsub@phillips.com</a> or by sending a copy of your mailing label to <i>Phillips Investment Resources</i>, 7811 Montrose Rd., Potomac MD 20854, <i>Attention: Subscription Services</i>. 

Any other information you provide us, such as your <b>fax or telephone number</b>, is collected by us only to fulfill subscription orders that you have purchased or to contact you about your service.
</p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
<b><i>What happens when you order through InvestorPlace?</i></b>
</font>
</p><p>
When you order a free report or purchase a newsletter service, we will request certain personal information, including your name, postal address, daytime and evening telephone numbers, credit card number (where applicable) and e-mail address. <i>InvestorPlace</i> may supply some of this information to third parties for the twin purposes of administering and fulfilling your order. Individuals who do not have a Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express credit card are not permitted to make purchases online.
</p><p>
When you order a free report from <i>InvestorPlace</i>, you are given specific instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future e-mail alerts and other investment-oriented offers and information. All e-mails sent to you from <i>InvestorPlace</i> will also contain specific instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future messages. Receiving these e-mails is entirely your choice.
</p><p>
When you purchase a newsletter or other service through <i>InvestorPlace</i>, you will receive relevant bulletins from your newsletter author, announcements of new web-content, and information on new services provided by your newsletter author.  We may also use your e-mail address to contact you with questions about your subscription or service, or to remind you of your site password, if necessary. 
</p><p>
Your personal information is not shared with third parties other than as described above. 
</p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
<b><i>How can you be sure that your information is secure?</i></b>
</font>
</p><p>
We take the security of your personal information quite seriously, and are constantly improving our efforts to protect it. However, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secured. Though we take great care to protect your personal information, <i>InvestorPlace</i> cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We do not share your credit card number with other parties, other than those involved with the administration of your subscription.  We do not share other information except as described in this policy.
</p><p>
If any unauthorized use of your credit card occurs as a result of your credit card purchase from <i>InvestorPlace</i>, simply notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If, through no fault of your own, your credit card company finds credit card fraud but does not waive your entire liability for unauthorized charges, we will reimburse you for the remaining liability, up to a maximum of fifty U.S. dollars ($50.00) per card. 

You can also take steps to secure your personal information.  When you are finished at <i>InvestorPlace</i>, sign off the <i>InvestorPlace</i> site and close your browser window. This helps to ensure that someone else cannot pose as you online. This is especially important if you are at a computer that is accessible to others at a public place, such as a library, a school, or your office.

Phillips Investment Resources is a dynamic investment advisory service.  As our business continues to develop and grow, it is possible that we might sell or buy other publishers, advisory services, products or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Phillips Investment Resources, or a substantial part all of its assets (including InvestorPlace.com) are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
