			<p class="font-base">ScoutIt, Inc. (InfoScout’s parent company) recognizes that you should have the right to know how the data we collect

			consumers receive value back when they shop and to help brands and retailers better understand consumer behavior. This Privacy 
			Policy applies to all information collected by ScoutIt, Inc., Inc. and any corporate affiliates (collectively, “ScoutIt, Inc.”) 
			for current and former consumers in connection with all the products, services, websites and mobile applications we offer on 
			behalf of ourselves or others. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions or concerns. </p>

			us in any other way, for example, where we are the service provider for a Rewards Program.  Wherever we provide examples of 
			information in this Privacy Policy, the examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Information about your purchases with Participating Retailers</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may receive information about your purchases from Participating Retailers.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Award information</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We will maintain records to keep track of the Awards you earn.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Information from cookies</h4>
			<p class="font-base">When you visit a ScoutIt, Inc. website or click on a banner advertisement, we may send one or more cookies to your computer 
			or other device. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some 
			ScoutIt, Inc. website features or services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Log and other information</h4>
			<p class="font-base">When you access a ScoutIt, Inc. website, email, advertisement, or other content served by or on behalf of us on other websites 
			or mobile applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These 
			server logs typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of 
			your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or Account(s) to us. Other actions, such as 
			interactions with advertisements, may also be included in our server logs. During some visits to our websites we may use 
			software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, 
			length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used 
			to browse away from the page.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Information from other sources</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may receive information about you from various sources.  This may include estimated demographic information from data 
			collection companies and others in order for us to offer anonymous market research reports to clients and partners.</p>
			
			<p class="font-base">We may link Nonpersonal Information about you with any Personal Information we have.</p>

			<h2 class="margin-top20">How does ScoutIt, Inc. use my information?</h2>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">To manage your Account(s)</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We use the information we collect to manage your Account(s). For example, we use the information you provide us and the purchase 
			information we collect to track, process, post and fulfill Awards you earn and to provide customer service.  In addition, we may use 
			this information to keep you informed of new features and product developments as well as to provide more relevant offers to you.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">To contact you</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may use the contact information we receive from you or third parties to contact you via email, direct mail, telephone or other 
			channels such as text messaging, Facebook and Twitter, in each case provided we are permitted by law to send such communications to you 
			and you have not otherwise opted-out of receiving them. For example, we may, on behalf of or at the request of, the Rewards Program 
			Sponsor(s) for the Rewards Program(s) you participate in, use your contact information to send you emails about our products or services 
			and/or the product and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others. We may also use your 
			contact information to provide you administrative communications from time to time.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">For market research purposes</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We use the information we collect to provide clients with anonymous market research reports.   For example, “What percentage of 
			Females in the Midwest buy Brand X products?”   We may also partner with third-party market research companies who may leverage the 
			data to support the creation of their own anonymous market research reports based on proprietary data they collect via other sources.   
			However, your data shall NOT be sold to third-parties for the purposes of marketing to you.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">To develop, evaluate, improve and deliver our products and services</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We use the information we collect to develop, evaluate, improve and deliver our product and services, and the products and services 
			of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others. For example, if we learn from the information we 
			collect that certain brands or categories of products are highly valuable to Registered Users, we may offer more services or Awards for those products. </p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">To deliver personalized advertisements and other information to you</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may use the information we collect to deliver advertisements about our products and services, and/or the products and services of 
			Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others on our websites, other websites, mobile applications, or 
			in other marketing channels. For example, we may use the purchase information we collect about you because of your participation in one 
			or more Rewards Program(s) to deliver to you, via one or more of those channels, advertisements that we, or the parties whose products or 
			services we are promoting, think may be of interest to you. We also may engage third party advertising networks to deliver these 
			advertisements. These networks use cookies and similar technologies to personalize the advertising content you see and to measure the 
			effectiveness of the advertisements they deliver. These companies are authorized to use the information we provide and they collect when 
			you navigate to a website within the ad network to provide this service to us.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Fulfill legal and regulatory requirements</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may use the information we collect to comply with federal, state, or other applicable laws and regulations.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Protect the rights or property of ScoutIt, Inc. or our Registered Users</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We also may use the information we collect to the extent we believe it is necessary or appropriate to enforce or apply our rights 
			under our agreements with Registered Users, and/or to protect the rights, property or safety of ScoutIt, Inc., our Registered Users and others.</p>


			<h2 class="margin-top20">How does ScoutIt, Inc. share your information?</h2>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Personal Information</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may share Personal Information with Rewards Program Sponsors. In the future, we may also share information with partner companies 
			that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy with 
			respect to the Personal Information we share with them.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Information we share with Rewards Program Sponsors</h4>

			for that Rewards Program any Personal Information we receive about you including, without limitation, your name, mailing address, email address, 
			phone number, username, Account activity, including information about the Award offers you activated and redeemed. Rewards Program Sponsors are 
			third party companies independent of ScoutIt, Inc. that may use the information we provide them to evaluate, develop, offer and promote their 
			products and services to you and others.</p>
			
			<h4 class="margin-bottom10 margin-top20">Contests, sweepstakes and surveys</h4>

			subject to a different privacy policy after the transaction.</p>
			
			<h4>Protection of ScoutIt, Inc. and others:</h4>
			<p class="font-base">We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, 
			such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of a legal proceeding. We may also disclose Personal Information 
			as we believe appropriate to enforce or apply our rights under our agreements with Registered Users, to protect the rights, property or safety of 
			ScoutIt, Inc., our Registered Users and others, including exchanging information for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

			<p class="font-base">We may provide Nonpersonal Information about you to clients, partners, Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, 
			or others for marketing, analysis and other purposes. For example, your purchase information may be aggregated with the purchase information of 
			other Registered Users and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of certain award offers or advertisements, and the results of that analysis 
			may be shared with Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others.</p>
