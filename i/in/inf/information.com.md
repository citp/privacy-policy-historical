# Information.com

At Information.com, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use Information.com services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. 

**Data collection**

  * Information.com does not require any personally identifying information, except as set forth below. 

  * We collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 

  * We use Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. Coremetrics' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, go to: http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html 

  * Some of our services require you to register for an account. Information.com asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, username and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service. 

  * In the event that our parent company or we merge with or are acquired by another legal entity, the personal information collected by us may be transferred to that other legal entity as an asset. 

  * We will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law, or is necessary or desirable to investigate or protect against harmful activities to customers, employees, or others, or to property (including this site). 




**Cookies**

  * Upon your first visit to Information.com, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. Information.com does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. 




**Updating your information**

  * We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information for many of our services. For more information, please see the help pages for each service. 




**Links**

  * The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Information.com services are developed by people over whom Information.com exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policy of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

  * Information.com may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of Information.com’s search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. 




**Changes to this Policy**

Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are more significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more prominent notice. We archive each version of our Policy Policy and each version will be noted at the top of the page. 

**Special Notification for California Residents**

Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their personal information to us may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at privacy@information.com. Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph. 

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us any time at _[privacy@information.com](mailto:privacy@information.com)_.
