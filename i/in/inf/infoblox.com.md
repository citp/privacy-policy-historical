Infoblox only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the web site or services so that we can improve the website and services. As part of this use of information, we may also provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers generally use our site.

This data regarding services helps us determine how effective support service is, so we can improve our self-service tools and make them as effective as possible.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at [mailing@infoblox.com](mailto:mailing@infoblox.com) and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.
