    <br>
    I am committed to protecting your privacy. I will only use the information 
    that I collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection 
    Act 1998). I will not pass on your details to any third party and do not 
    send out marketing e-mails to customers unless they have registered to 
    receive such material, purchased from me, or downloaded one of my free or

    information about you without your explicit consent. The information I hold 
    will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that I hold

    you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.<br>
    <br>
    How I Control Your Personal Information<br>
    <br>
    I will not use your personal information for any other reason other than to 
    contact you. We do not sell, give away or rent your email address to any 
    third party. If in the future I did for any reason wish to rent, sell or use 
    your email address for any other purpose we will ask you for your permission 
    first.<br>
    <br>
    How We Use Your Personal Information<br>
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    3. To help me create and deliver content most relevant to you.<br>
    <br>
    4. To enlighten you about new products, services, tool, upgrades, special 
    offers and information which I feel may be of use to you.<br>
    <br>
    I will only disclose your personal information, without notice, if required 
    to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
