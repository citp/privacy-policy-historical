#### Email privacy and security...

Other than for a related secondary purpose (see the Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Policy), RMIT Training will not send you any unsolicited mail or email. You will be asked to give permission for RMIT Training to use your address to send any promotional information or to be placed on a mail list. You will also be informed of any related secondary purpose for which your information may be used and can opt-out of receiving any material that may result from that purpose at any stage. 

If you are not an RMIT Training staff member or student, RMIT Training records your email address only if you email RMIT Training.

RMIT Training does use email for routine business communication to its staff and students, and keeps consolidated lists for these purposes. Such email is sent only to RMIT Training owned, allocated and managed email addresses. 

In the above processes, email logs may be kept temporarily for the purpose of identifying and dealing with any inappropriate use of email. Such records are stored securely. 

### 3.4 Technical identifying information RMIT Training web servers collect from your visits to RMIT Training websites

#### 3.4.1 Cookies

Some of the features on RMIT Training websites require the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer. 

We use cookies to: 

  * remember your personal details;
  * enhance your experience using an RMIT Training website; and
  * personalise the service you receive from an RMIT Training website.



We make very limited use of cookies and we do not use cookies to access data on your hard drive, to determine your e-mail address, or to view data in cookies created by other websites. Cookies only store information that a web server places in them. They cannot look at other cookies on your hard drive nor can they look at any other information on your computer. We do not use cookies to harvest information from your computer. 

#### 3.4.2 Session cookies

RMIT Training websites use temporary session cookies to collect identifying information about the user, such as user behaviour or user preferences for a specific website. These cookies are no longer accessible after the browser session expires i.e. once it has been inactive for fifteen minutes or when the browser is closed. 

#### 3.4.3 Permanent, persistent or stored cookies

These are used in only personal details and contact us forms. They help to remember your personal details therefore the users do not have to enter their first name, family name over and over again across the RMIT Training websites. These cookies are stored on the user's hard drive. 

Please note that users do not have to have permanent cookies enabled in order to use our websites but session cookies must be enabled to use RMIT Training websites. All browsers allow the user to independently allow session cookies from permanent cookies. There are a number of Internet browsers and different versions of each browser which all act in different ways. If you choose not to accept our cookies, it may affect the way you experience our websites and they may not be fully functional. 

## Logging of visits to RMIT Training websites

RMIT Training may make a record of your visits to RMIT Training websites and logs any of the following information for security, statistical, recording, and other business purposes: the user's server address, the user's domain name, IP address, the date and time of the visit, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser used. This information is not disclosed, sold, or made available to other organisations and is stored securely. An important use is to track and identify inappropriate usage and hence provide a more secure online environment. Any disclosure for reporting purposes is done in ways which do not allow an individual user to be identified. 

In addition, RMIT Training does not acquire this sort of information from other organisations. 

## What security is in place when you leave personal or financial information

A technically secure environment is in place for when personal or financial information is collected through RMIT Training websites, to ensure that it cannot be accessed by other users or organisations. 

The RMIT Training (including RMIT University) network which hosts the RMIT Training websites and all RMIT Training online systems has highly sophisticated security and publishing systems in place. Technically this includes firewalling, intrusion detection, port filtering, password-login, virus protection, and packet shaping. 

E-commerce transactions involving authorisation to pay RMIT Training fees, or purchase products or services are conducted within the secure online environment of the secure payment service that has been contracted by RMIT Training. Users are passed through to that secure payment service automatically at the final payment stage of a purchase request. 

## How does logging into RMIT Training websites work?

RMIT Training students, staff, and other approved persons have a license to log into RMIT Training websites. This enables them to securely access important information and online services restricted to them, and not visible to, or available to visitors. Logging in to access these services is conducted in a safe and secure environment. 

When logging in, staff and students authenticate who they are by entering on a webpage the staff or student number allocated for their use by RMIT Training, and a unique password that they have generated. 

Student and staff numbers are stored securely. It is important that users with this license abide by RMIT Training approved use policies, especially keeping their number and password secure, and ensuring they log off when finished. In this way, their personal information, and that of others is protected from unauthorised access and misuse. 

## Links from RMIT Training websites to other websites

RMIT Training websites contain links to external (non RMIT Training) websites. RMIT Training is not, and cannot be responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of these websites. A link to another website does not imply an RMIT Training association with, or endorsement of, that website.
