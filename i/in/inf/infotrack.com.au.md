# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Statement**

InfoTrack’s Privacy Statement has been issued to make you aware of the organisation's procedures regarding the handling of personal and sensitive information, including collection, use, disclosure and storage of information, as well as the right of individuals to access and correct that information.

InfoTrack will comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act).  
InfoTrack will ensure that individuals are advised of InfoTrack’s identity whenever personal information is collected.

In summary, 'personal information' is information or an opinion relating to an individual which can be used to identify that individual.

InfoTrack may collect personal information in order to conduct our business, to provide and market our services and to meet our legal obligations.

The type of information we may collect and hold includes (but is not limited to) personal information about: 

  * clients, business associates and potential clients and their employees;
  * suppliers and their employees; and
  * prospective employees, employees and contractors.



Personal information may consist of names, addresses, contact details, occupations and other information.

In many cases, if personal information we request is not provided, we may not be able to supply the relevant product or service. InfoTrack will use its best endeavours to ensure that an individual is advised of the consequences of not providing the requested information. This may include individual collection statements.

InfoTrack will ensure the individual is advised (via the respective individual collection statements) of the type of organisation that may be provided with the collected information. Organisations to which InfoTrack discloses information may include insurers, solicitors and mailing houses.

InfoTrack will not provide personal information to third parties without the prior consent of the individual providing the information.

InfoTrack will only collect and use information for the purpose exposed to the individual at the time of collection (via the respective individual collection statements). Organisations to which INFOTRACK discloses information may include insurers, solicitors and mailing houses.

InfoTrack will destroy any personal information collected, either once its need has been met or as prescribed by the Privacy Act.

InfoTrack will ensure that all personal information remains secure from unauthorized access. InfoTrack will not send your personal information to recipients outside of Australia without obtaining your consent (in some cases consent will be implied) or complying with the Privacy Act.

InfoTrack will ensure that an equitable and unbiased complaint process is available to all individuals. The Compliance Officer, an internally appointed position, will oversee this process. InfoTrack will ensure that where a complaint cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties involved, the matter will be referred unhindered to the Federal Commissioner of Privacy for action.

InfoTrack will make available to an individual on receipt of a formal request, the personal information collected from that individual. InfoTrack reserves the right to refuse a request to access personal information, where the identity of the individual making the request is in doubt, or where legal professional privilege exists or where InfoTrack’s rights may be prejudiced.

InfoTrack will take all reasonable precautions to ensure the personal information it has collected from an individual remains correct and accurate.

InfoTrack takes reasonable steps to protect personal information held from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
