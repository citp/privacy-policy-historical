## Accessibility of Your Information

Our services, and in particular our Carta® service, are designed so that users can interact with each other to transact business related sales and purchases and post social comments. We prefer that all social comments and interactions be oriented to Your enterprises rather than for personal use, but our services do not filter or monitor in respect of this.

You have control over, and You are responsible for, what information is accessible to others aside from us (i.e. other users). This is done via Your choices in the Privacy or Sharing Settings of our services and by specific actions that You take from time to time when using our services.

Your use of our services can also result in making other information accessible to others which is not covered by the Privacy or Sharing Settings as a result of actions that You take. For example, if You create an order with a supplier using our services, then both You and Your supplier will be able to view the order; if You click on the Share button or send a URL address to a third party that information is then accessible by them.

We reserve the right to change the Privacy and Sharing Settings and their related default behavior within our services, but we will post notice of such changes on our affected website(s).

Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other registered users and their respective companies and organizations, and you should review their practices before transacting business with them or interacting with them.

## Our Use of the Information

We do not sell Your personal information to third parties.

Unless we have received explicit consent from an individual user to divulge his or her personal information to a third party, we will not disclose personal information about an individual user except to carry out his/her instructions or as reasonably necessary to provide the services that she/he has registered for, or as noted in this Privacy Policy.

However, information we collect from you may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, financing, insolvency or bankruptcy involving us. In addition we may provide such information to our suppliers providing us with goods and services related to providing You our services (e.g. our cloud service provider(s) and third party software maintenance service providers).

We reserve the right to send out notices and information, including third party notices and information, that we think will be of interest to our users, and Your use of our services constitutes your consent to receiving these communications. **You can opt out of receiving these communications by going to the unsubscribe link embedded in the communication and following the procedure described there.**

We use the information that You provide to us and that we gather to provide our services including billing and support, to tailor materials to suit your needs, and to help our clients better understand our users demographics.

## Protection of the Information

We have implemented commercially available security measures to secure Your information, and we use reputable cloud service providers to provide the data storage related to our services. But because our services utilize the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any information you submit to us will be free from unauthorized intrusion that could result in in being accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. We also cannot guarantee that other technical issues, including software coding errors, may not result in an inadvertent disclosure, alteration or destruction of Your information.

You control your own password, and should ensure that it is secure and strong. Also remember that Your communications with us and other users using e-mail, IM and similar means are not encrypted, and thus potentially vulnerable. Please ensure that You have appropriate back up for all Your information.

As a result, we shall not be responsible or liable for any loss of privacy, disclosure of information, harm, damage or loss that may result from unauthorized access to or disclosure of any information that You have provided to us or transmitted through or to our services. Please also refer to our User Agreement for the service you are using regarding further limitations in respect of our liability.

However if You notify us in accordance with our applicable User Agreement that you no longer want to use a service, or we terminate Your use of our service(s), we will deactivate your profile and related information so that it is no longer readily available to others or to You.

Within a reasonable period of time after a termination, we will not use Your personal information except as reasonably necessary for us to enforce this Privacy Policy and/or our User Agreement, to comply with obligations imposed upon us by law or regulation, or to resolve any disputes between You and others. We will, however, continue to use the information derived from Your use of our services and visits to our website(s) as noted in this Privacy Policy.
