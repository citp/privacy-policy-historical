## Transparency

Because Archon Systems Inc. (“Archon”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) gather certain types of information about our users (“users”, “You” and “Your”), we feel You should understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This Privacy Policy discloses what personal information we gather and how we use it.

## General

Please note that “including”, the phrases “e.g.,” or “for example” and any derivatives of any of the foregoing mean “including, without limitation”; and the examples provided should not be considered to be all-inclusive or limiting.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the products and services offered by Archon.

 **Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services offered by, or the information practices of, other enterprises or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed or offered to You in the use of our products, services and websites, or other websites linked to our services and websites (e.g. Shopify, Dymo, Quickbooks). You should theretofore review their policies to understand their practices before you link to, or transact business with, them through our services. We are not responsible or liable for such parties’ use of Your information.**

## Accessibility of Your Information – How You Control It

Our services, and in particular the Online Showroom feature of our inFlow Cloud™ Services, are designed so that users publish their product information online for their customers or public to see. Our services do not filter or monitor in respect of this.

 **You have control over, and You are responsible for, what information is accessible to other users of InFlow Cloud™ and the public.** This is done via Your choices in the Online Showroom Settings of our services, and by specific actions that You take from time to time when using our services such as invoicing or adding users to Your account.

 **Be careful:** Your use of our services can also result in making other information accessible to others which is not covered by the Online Showroom Settings as a result of actions that You take. For example, if You choose to allow Public Access to Your Online Showroom and choose to show the Pricing Information, then anyone on the Internet will be able to see Your products with their respective prices. When You add a user to Your account or You issue an invoice through our services, You are handling personal information and should ensure that You do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

 **Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other registered users of our products or services and their respective companies and organizations. Our products and services also enable you to exchange data with third party services, such as Shopify. You should review the data/information policies of other users and third party services before transacting business with them or interacting with them.**

Please note that we reserve the right to change the Online Showroom Settings and their related default behavior within our services, but we will post notice of such changes on our affected website(s).
