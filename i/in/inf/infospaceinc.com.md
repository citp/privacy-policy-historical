  * **Anonymous User Information.** We collect anonymous (i.e. non-personally identifying) information that your browser and cell phone make available each time you visit an InfoSpace Site or use another InfoSpace Property, such as our mobile data and content services. The browser information includes your originating Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and operating system, the date and time of your visit, the duration and activity of your visit and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the referring and exiting Web sites. We generally use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. The cell phone information we collect includes type of handset, menu selection and other anonymous use information. Additionally, for our mobile gaming tournaments, we collect anonymous demographic data that includes age, sex, type, and number of repeat subscriptions. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, designing and developing new products and services and generally improving the overall quality of your experience.
  * **Personal User Information.** In addition to the anonymous user information above, we may occasionally request from you or you may otherwise voluntarily provide us information that may identify you personally. InfoSpace receives personal user information through its different properties from a broad range of activities, including surveys, contests, personalization of directory services, public records services, user groups, tell-a-friend service, mobile data transmission services and general correspondence. Also, we may receive personal information from third party service providers as part of our search and directory and mobile products and services. Depending on the product or service used, the personal information we collect typically includes contact information (such as name, address, email address and telephone number), demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation and household income) and billing information (shipping and billing address, credit card information). When we request personal information from you, we will inform you of the type of information we need and the purpose of our use. Except as specifically described in this Privacy Policy and the associated privacy policies of our various properties, we will in general only use your personal information for the purpose it was collected.
  * **Mobile User Information.** As part of our mobile products and services, we receive personal information from wireless carriers and operators in order to provision the specific content and data services requested by individual cell phone users. All such personal information is acquired from either the wireless carrier's Web site or from the user's cell phone via the wireless carrier's network. This personal data is usually limited to the user's name and cell phone number. In certain cases, such as for gaming tournament prize fulfillment, the user's mailing address is also provided. The user must explicitly "opt in" through the wireless carrier in order for any of this information to be collected and its use is governed by this Privacy Policy and any policies or procedures of the user's wireless carrier. We only use personal information we receive as part of our mobile products and services for the purpose of providing those products and services to the wireless carriers and operators and their subscribers.
