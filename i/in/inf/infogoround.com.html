      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Last Updated: April 25, 2005</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">InfoGoRound.com strives to offer its 
      visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
      interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally 
      Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, 
      telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will 
      never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third 
      party. Period.</font></small></p>

      </b><p><b><small><font face="Verdana">How we gather information from users</font></small></b></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">How we collect and store information 
      depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
      participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to 
      provide information when you register for access to certain portions of 
      our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make 
      a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
      sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
      interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, InfoGoRound.com also 
      collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools 
      that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name 
      of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize 
      you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie 
      may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter 
      that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times 
      you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we 
      adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other 
      means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
      information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept 
      cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the 
      site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may 
      not be able to customize the site’s features according to your 
      preferences.</font></small></p>

      </b><p><b><small><font face="Verdana">What we do with the information we collect</font></small></b></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Like other Web publishers, we collect 
      information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content 
      and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information 
      with anyone.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Aggregated Information (information that 
      does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, 
      we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar 
      information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and 
      services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
      most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with 
      our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not 
      include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone 
      to identify you individually.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">We may use Personally Identifiable 
      Information collected on InfoGoRound.com to communicate with you about 
      your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and 
      privacy policy; services and products offered by InfoGoRound.com and other 
      topics we think you might find of interest. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Verdana">Personally Identifiable Information 
      collected by InfoGoRound.com may also be used for other purposes, 
      including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, 
      processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and 
      contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who 
      provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting 
      service for example) may access such information. We will use your 
      information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
      continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with 
      other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may 
      be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in 
      response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are 
      reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of 
      amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever 
      we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you 
      with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></small></p>
