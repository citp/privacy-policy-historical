## STYLE GUIDES

Influenster is a forum for your thoughtful reviews, photos, videos, tips and more. Thus, we've put together these general guidelines for keeping it clean and classy here on our site:

##### INFLUENSTER REVIEW SECTION

Go Bare: That’s right, bare it all. The best reviews are personal and passionate as well as open and honest. Writing a review of something you received from us? Make sure to disclose that you received the products free from Influenster for testing purposes.

Use Good Taste: We Influensters pride ourselves on our style, so don’t trash your reputation by using offensive language and imagery. Furthermore, threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry will not be tolerated.

Stay in Good Form: Let’s save the non sequiturs for the blogosphere. We expect your contributions to be relevant to the product you’re reviewing. Reviews aren't the place for rants about political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.

Cut Out the Bias: Your contributions should be objective. Don’t review your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' businesses, or businesses in your networking group.

Say It, Don’t Sell It: The power of Influenster is the power of YOU. Here, consumers have the final word, so let’s not muck up our review section with more commercial noise.

Keep Secrets: Remember the Golden Rule? Please respect the privacy of others. This means refraining from publishing personal information, close-up photos, and full names of any of your friends, enemies, and countrymen.

Innovation, Not Imitation: What you learned in middle school still applies - absolutely NO plagiarism. We want to hear from you, so show us your (own) stuff!

Avoid the Overstatement: It’s easy to get carried away. Please avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting your experience.

Be Picky - Click Hearts with Discretion: These hearts don’t mean whether you “Agree.” Like reviews only when they’re useful, helpful, and truthful. Reviews are sorted by what's most helpful, so make sure new visitors see the ones that shine.

Be Constructive: We all know how disappointing it can be when you buy something only to find it doesn’t work the way you thought it would. While it may be tempting to vent your frustrations here, remember that reviews should relay “what” and “why.” And please, for everyone’s sake, lay off the caps lock.

Be Creative: These reviews weren’t written by robots. Let the “you” shine through!

##### THE Q&A SECTION

Be Curious: Influensters have the answers. If you want to know more about a product, use the Q&A section. But first, check that your question hasn’t already been asked. It probably has!

Share the Wealth: Think you’ve got the answer? Help out your fellow Influensters with all the info you’ve got. Your answers should be helpful, honest, and relevant. Spread the knowledge!

*Please be advised that Influenster retains the right to remove any inappropriate content or to revoke membership for Style Guide violations.

##### ON YOUR BLOG, VLOG, AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS

Heed the VoxFox: In all online features and comments, please make sure to disclose that you received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. This keeps everyone honest - you, us, and our partners - so we can all be trusted Influensters.

Title, Title, Title: Don’t keep it a secret. Include the name of the product you’re reviewing in your blog or video title.

Keep it Clean: The Influenster Facebook page is a hub for our community. Use clean language, courteous behavior, and appropriate images. Failure to do so will result in a ban from the page.

##### THE HUB

Stay Considerate & Constructive: Show your fellow Influenster bloggers some love by commenting on their posts, but remember the Golden Rule - respect them as they would do for you!

Submit Quality: Influensters value fun, quality posts and we hold the rights to decide what in Influenster Nation is appropriate or not, when specially inviting you to contribute to The Hub.

## DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT

##### INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

The Federal Trade Commission requires testing program participants to disclose that they have received products for complimentary testing purposes in all reviews, social media posts, videos and blogs. Please note that failure to abide by these rules will result in suspension from Influenster. Because no one looks good in an orange jumpsuit, we've set out the following guidelines to help keep you on the right side of the law:

Writing a blog post or review online? Copy & paste this line at the bottom: “I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes"

Filming a video? Do a dramatic reading of the following: “I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.” You can also copy & paste this text in the “About” section of your video.

Posting on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, or Vine? Make sure you attach the appropriate hashtags as outlined on the cheat sheet section. Cheat Sheet is accessible on your campaign home page.

Participating in Brand Challenge? Make sure to use appropriate hashtags as outlined in the challenge rules, such as #contest.

Want more? We even have a nifty widget you can include on your blog so you can wear your status as an Influenster with pride!

*Remember: If you're unsure on how to disclose, you can always look for the Influenster VoxFox. He's your helpful disclaimer guide to staying in the clear!

Happy Posting!

The Influenster Team

##### PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE

Personal Information: When registering as a user to the Service, we receive and store information you enter or provide to us in any other way. The types of personal information collected may include your name, email address, URL, phone number, Twitter, Tumblr, Google Plus and/or Facebook usernames, location, use information regarding your use of the Service, browser information, and any other data that is tied to such information (collectively, the “Personal Information”).

We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.

We only use this data in aggregate form to perform statistical analyses on user behavior and characteristics. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and the Service.

##### HOW MY INFORMATION IS SHARED

Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. You acknowledge and agree that we may share your Public Content and a limited amount of Personal Information (by way of illustration and not limitation, your first name, last initial, and location) with third parties, who may in turn publicly display or publish this limited amount of Personal Information in connection with your Public Content on their own website and media platforms. However, at any time you may visit the "Account Settings" page of your Member Account and opt-out of having some or all of your Personal Information made available to such third parties as described herein.

We provide some of our services through affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties. We, and our service partners, may use your personal information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. These affiliates and third party service providers are not permitted to use personal information for any purposes other than to complete the order, assist you in participating in the particular service and communicating with you. We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.

We may disclose information in the aggregate to third parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.

In the future, may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Service. These companies may use information about your Public Content (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and activity related to your use of the Service to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

One of the primary reasons people use Influenster is to connect with others. Information such as your name and photo, photos of your items, location, list of friends, and the comments you write is shared with the Influenster community. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Service.

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, such as the creation of shipping labels, and need to share your information with them to provide services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.

Law Enforcement and Protection. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our TOS and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.

Invite Friends and Contacts. You may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address or social network profile information so that person may be invited to create an account on this site and become your friend. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. By providing us with another person's e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the person concerned with respect to such disclosure to us of their Personal Information. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.

Business Transfers. If Influenster or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that we cease business operations or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
