#### EFFECTIVE AS OF May 25, 2018

 

##### **NOTICE OF PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING**

 

Your privacy, and the privacy of all Influenster users is important to us. Influenster is committed to protecting your privacy online and to complying with the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or “GDPR”. Accordingly, Influenster has developed this privacy policy that describes how we collect, store, use, share and dispose of your personal data (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy sets forth the policies and procedures of personal information received from users of the Service, including but not limited to the website at [www.influenster.com](https://web.archive.org/external?next=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.influenster.com%3Futm_source%3Dinfluenster) and the mobile applications created by Influenster (collectively, the “Influenster Service” or “Service”), and the ways in which you can exercise your rights under the GDPR. The terms “You” and “Your” refer to you, as a visitor or user of the Service. This Privacy Policy is intended for and only applicable to site visitors, registered users, and all other users of the Service in the European Union.

 

##### **DATA CONTROLLER: WHO WE ARE.**

 

The terms “We”, “Us”, and “Influenster ” refer to VoxPop Communities, Inc. d/b/a Influenster. We are a “Controller” for purposes of processing personal data and as defined in the GDPR. We are responsible for operating and maintaining the Influenster Service.

 

##### **GOODS AND SERVICES: WHAT WE OFFER.**

We are a data processing and marketing company. The Influenster Service allows you to browse reviews and product deals, connect with our community of members and test and review third party products and services. By using the Service, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as we may disclose to you in the future, with your consent.

Further, you acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our [Terms of Service](https://www.influenster.com/p/eu-terms) (“TOS”), which is incorporated by reference, and by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the terms in this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions in our TOS, you may not access or use the Service.

##### **PERSONAL DATA: WHAT WE COLLECT.**

**Account Setup:** When registering as a user to the Service, we receive and store information you enter or provide to us in any other way. The types of personal data collected may include or be included in the following:

 

  * first and last name
  * email address
  * Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Google Plus, Facebook and/or other social media usernames and public profile information
  * profile and cover photos
  * IP address
  * location (country and zip code) you provide
  * location data (GPS coordinates) based on your mobile device settings
  * your personal characteristics, preferences and interests (such as birthday, gender, income, education, household status, ethnicity, skin type, facial attributes, hair type, health preferences, number of children and pets)
  * information requested for participation in pre-surveys and brand campaigns
  * information provided by you for public display or otherwise
  * information collected automatically when you use the Service

 

**VoxBox Pre-Surveys:** You may be asked to provide additional personal data through the VoxBox pre-survey process. This is when we determine whether you are eligible to be selected for a VoxBox or other promotional campaign.

 

**Profiles and Reviews:** “Public Content” refers to information that you submit or post to the Service for public display, such as photos, comments, reviews, and your public profile information. To the extent you include personal data in your Public Content (such as a photo of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your account, and contact you. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in any Public Content.

 

**Information Collected Automatically:** When you use the Service, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, your use of the Service and any other data that is tied to such information.

 

**Do Not Track Signals:** We do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "Do Not Track" instructions. You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. For more information on Do Not Track please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.org/](https://web.archive.org/external?next=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.allaboutdnt.org%2F%3Futm_source%3Dinfluenster).

 

##### **PURPOSES: WHY WE NEED YOUR PERSONAL DATA.**

 

**To Provide the Service:** The personal data you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service, provide the information and services described in our [Terms of Service](https://www.influenster.com/p/eu-terms) and this Privacy Policy, improving the content of the Service based on your interests, preferences and interactions with the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We may also draw upon this personal data in order to adapt the Service to better meet user needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.

 

**For Marketing:** We may use your personal data to contact you or have third parties contact you on our behalf for the purpose of marketing products and services. By checking the box below, you expressly consent to any such communications. You will always have the opportunity to opt out of further marketing communications by following the link provided in any such communication or responding with a request to Influenster to unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

 

##### **PROCESSING: WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL DATA.**

 

**Internal Processing.** At Influenster, we collect, maintain and use your data to provide the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, processing personal data in the following ways:

 

  * **User signup/onboarding:** We collect information when you create a user profile during the signup / onboarding process. Depending on your privacy settings, we may display your profile and location data when you use the Service and to allow you to find and follow your friends. We also aggregate user data to analyze and select users for pre-surveys and brand campaigns.
  * **User snaps/surveys:** "Snaps" and surveys are sent to users and voluntarily filled out to assist with selection for brand campaigns and VoxBoxes. Each survey is unique to a campaign, so a user is prompted for data on a by-campaign basis and this information is not propagated from one campaign to the next. We may update your non-public account information with relevant information you provide during the pre-survey process.
  * **Campaign selection:** We use personal data for purposes of selecting users for individual brand campaigns based on a range of criteria specified by brand. We may use this data to recommend products and services that may be of interest to you. We also aggregate user data to analyze user trends.
  * **Public Content:** We use your reviews and other Public Content throughout the Service. Such Public Content becomes the proprietary information of Influenster pursuant to our [Terms of Service](https://www.influenster.com/p/eu-terms) and as described below under the Third Party Disclosures header.
  * **Public Content syndication:** We syndicate reviews and other Public Content to third parties, including directly with product manufacturers and others. This means that your reviews and other Public Content will be displayed on third party platforms and could be used by third parties in their own marketing campaigns or otherwise.
  * **Social media accounts:** When you connect your social media accounts, we receive access to your public profile and permission to post to your account. We assess your impact score based on factors in your linked social media accounts, such as numbers of followers and likes. We use this information to determine your eligibility for brand campaigns, promotions and other deals.
  * **Email marketing:** We use your personal data to send you updates on products, newsletters, and new and upcoming campaigns. We don’t share your email address with third parties without your prior consent.
  * **Product recommendations:** When you interact with a product (add a photo, rate the product, etc.) we suggest additional interactions with that product (to write a review, upload a video, etc.). We may also display your profile information in connection with any reviews you write or other Public Content you post to validate and allow other users to assess the relevance of your reviews.
  * **Location Information:** We use your location data to comply with the law and to determine your eligibility for brand campaigns, promotions and other deals. If your location settings are turned on when you use the Service, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser to tailor your experience. We collect and store your last known location to determine your proximity to our service partners. This location information is not shared with third parties. The Service also uses your mobile device’s background location to provide the Service, which allows us to provide you with location-based services, such as location-specific promotions, mobile-based campaign activity capabilities, and other personalized content tailored to you. If you have background location turned on, the mobile application will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location even if you are not directly interacting with the application.
  * **Invite Friends and Contacts:** You may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address or social network profile information so that person may be invited to create an account on this site and become your friend. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. By providing us with another person's e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the person concerned with respect to such disclosure to us of their personal data. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described below.
  * **Targeted Ads:** We use Google AdSense to display targeted advertising based on your interests, preferences and interactions with the Service.

 

**Third Party Disclosures.** We encourage our service partners and other third parties to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal data by our service partners and other third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners or third parties, and is not subject to our control.

 

  * **Public Content:** Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We provide some of our services through affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties. We may share Public Content, as well as a limited amount of personal data associated with such Public Content (limited to your first name, last initial, email, public social media profile, and location) with third parties, who may in turn publicly display or publish this limited amount of personal data in connection with Public Content on their own website and media platforms. However, at any time you may visit the "Account Settings" page of your Member Account and change how your personal data is shared with such third parties.
  * **Aggregated Information:** We may disclose aggregated information concerning user behavior to third parties in connection with actual or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. Such aggregated information does not provide information that can be used to identify you individually. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.
  * **Third Party Advertising:** From time to time we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Service. These companies may use information about your Public Content (not including your personal data, unless posted as part of the Public Content) and activity related to your use of the Service to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
  * **Third Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, such as the creation of shipping labels, and need to share your information with them to provide services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your personal data.
  * **Law Enforcement and Protection:** We may disclose your personal data to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our TOS and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.
  * **Business Transfers:** If Influenster or substantially all of Influenster's assets are acquired in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer, or in the unlikely event that we cease business operations or enter into bankruptcy or a similar proceeding, user information could be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In such an event, we will provide you notice of any such transfer and update this Privacy Policy accordingly.

 

**Other:** We may otherwise disclose your personal data only for purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy, as required by law, or with your informed consent.

 

**Data Retention:** Influenster retains your personal data indefinitely. If you wish to delete your data, please see the "[Your Rights](https://www.influenster.com/p/eu-privacy#yourrights)" section below.

 

**Organizational and Technical Safeguards.** Processing of personal data happens in strict accordance with our company’s data governance program, which includes implementing reasonable organizational and technical safeguards to protect personal data from unauthorized use, disclosure, or destruction. Such organizational safeguards include binding our trusted third parties to contracts and requiring the same or better organizational or technical safeguards for your personal data.

 

##### **COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**

 

The Service does use cookies. All Influenster cookies are administered in accordance with our cookie policy provided through OneTrust here. We send cookies to your computer or mobile device through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Most browsers have an option for disabling the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting cookies, as well as (depending on your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of cookies in a variety of ways. If you later choose to reject cookies, please be advised that you will need to take additional steps in accordance with your browser and/or device settings to permanently remove any existing cookies from your computer or device.

 

Ads and other content appearing on the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners and your connected social media networks such as Facebook and Instagram, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad or social media network server to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an online advertisement or otherwise interact with your computer or device to compile information about you or others who use your computer or device. This information allows ad and social media networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements and other content that they believe will be of most interest to you, and in the case of social media networks, redirect you to their website for purposes of logging you in to the Service. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by us and our service providers and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or social media networks.

 

We use analytics (and related analytics programs) to better understand who is using the Service, and how people are using it. Analytics uses cookies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used. We use this information to improve the Service and make it appealing to as many users as possible.

 

##### **SECURITY**

 

Your account is password protected for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal data by selecting and protecting your password and limiting access to your computer, phone and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

 

##### **INTERNATIONAL USERS**

 

The Service is located on computer servers in the United States [and around the world], meaning your information will be processed and stored in the United States and elsewhere. As a result, United States federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in the United States. By checking the box below, you knowingly and expressly consent to the transfer of your personal data outside of your home country, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country.

The Service is not directed toward children under 16 years of age nor do we knowingly collect information from children under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, you are not permitted to submit any personal data to us.

 

##### **PRIVACY PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTIES AND THIRD PARTY SITES**

 

The Service may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites accessible through our site via links or service partnerships have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies may place advertising on our site and may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information.
