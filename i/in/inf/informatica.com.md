# Informatica Privacy Policy

Informatica Corporation and its subsidiary companies worldwide (“Informatica”) are committed to respecting your privacy.  This statement applies with respect to (i) personal data we collect (i) from [http://www.informatica.com/](https://web.archive.org/us/index.aspx "Informatica ") and any other sites on the World Wide Web owned and/or operated by Informatica (“Informatica Websites”) (ii) at events hosted or attended by Informatica (iii) via direct marketing campaigns conducted by telephone or email or (iv) in the course of other similar marketing activities. This statement is part of the Terms of Use of our website and is subject to all of its terms. Below is information regarding the commitment of Informatica to protect the personal data of individuals.

The term “personal data” includes any information that enables you to be identified, such as your name, physical address, e-mail address and/or phone number.

 **1\. Nature of the Data Collected and Purpose of the Data Processing**  
Collection – Websites - When you access the Informatica Websites, Informatica collects the IP address of the computer you are using to browse the site. If this address is a “static” or fixed IP address, Informatica could in certain circumstances theoretically be able to identify you, and therefore, this type of information could be considered personal data. However, Informatica only collects this type of information to compile usage statistics on an anonymous basis; Informatica does not collect IP address data to identify you.

Apart from your IP address, no personal data is transmitted when accessing Informatica Websites. Unless you submit personal data about yourself voluntarily by filling in a form or by sending us an e-mail, we will not maintain any other personal data as a result of your access and usage of the Informatica Websites.

If you have registered with Informatica by providing information through an online or paper form or over the phone, we use the information you submit by registering to contact you with customized marketing information by phone, post, on-line download or e-mail. You may request to cease receiving such information at any time following registration. You may request to be removed from our register by sending an email to [unsubscribe@informatica.com](mailto:unsubscribe@informatica.com) with the word “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the email subject line or by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. You may request to be removed from our postal mailing list by sending an e-mail message to [unsubscribe@informatica.com](mailto:unsubscribe@informatica.com) or by sending a letter to:

Informatica Corporation   
Attn: Privacy    
100 Cardinal Way   
Redwood City, CA 94063   
U.S.A.

Informatica Websites may also require you to register to enjoy certain services provided through the site, such as on-line support or on-line education. The information provided in the context of registering for these services is collected to respond to your inquiry, process an order, to provide you with access to specific account information or to enable us to provide you the aforementioned on-line services securely through password protection.

In addition, in order to better understand the needs of the visitors to the Informatica Websites and to adapt the Informatica Websites to these needs, we occasionally conduct on-line surveys. Participation in these surveys is optional. The data collected through these surveys is used for statistical analysis of visitor, Informatica product or product category assessments and for direct marketing purposes.

 **2\. Disclosure of Personal Data**  
Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your personal data to any third parties. When involved in a joint marketing partnership, seminar or similar offering, Informatica may share information which you have submitted to us with the partner company. Your personal data may also be shared with third party contractors, suppliers and service providers that Informatica engages in its normal course of business subject to the applicable non-disclosure obligations.

 **3\. Use of “Cookies”**  
Informatica Websites send “cookies” to your computer to better serve you with more tailored information when you return to the website. A cookie is a small element of data that can be sent by our web site to your browser and stored on your hard drive, not on Informatica's web site. Cookies do not collect information about visitors. Unless you input your Personal Data onto Informatica Websites you cannot be identified and you remain anonymous. You can set most browsers to tell you when you are sent a cookie and to refuse to receive it.

 **4\. Transfer of Your Data to Other Entities Belonging to the Group of Informatica Companies and to Third Parties**  
Informatica may disclose your personal data to other entities belonging to the Informatica group of companies located outside the United States.  In addition, Informatica may disclose your personal data to other entities within the EU belonging to the Informatica group of companies and to third parties located in the EU to the extent that such disclosure is not incompatible with the purposes for which the personal data is collected as mentioned above. 

 **5\. Security of Your Data**  
Informatica takes all commercially reasonable precautions to adequately prevent others from freely accessing the information you provide or that we compile. As you are no doubt aware, however, despite these precautions, zealous hackers may wrongfully gain access to this information. Although such unauthorized access is unlikely, we feel obligated to inform you of the risk and advise you that Informatica is not liable for any damages caused by such unauthorized access.

 **6\. Third Party Sites**  
This policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other sites (including those that we link to within an advertisement banner or otherwise, and third party sites or services which we cobrand) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.

 **7\. EU – US Safe Harbor**     
Informatica adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce with respect to personal data of residents in the European Economic Area and Switzerland that are passed to the United States.

Informatica is committed to the security of personal data and has implemented administrative, physical and technological safeguards designed to protect it from unauthorized access.

Informatica will engage in periodic self-assessment to verify that it continues to be in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
