The inquiry form requires web publishers and advertisers to give contact information (such as name and email address). Infolinks uses this information to contact web publishers and advertisers about the services on the Website in which they have expressed interest. Web publishers have the option to provide information (such as website address and vertical sector) to Infolinks. Infolinks encourages them to submit this information so we can provide them a more customized reply to their inquiry.

Infolinks uses this information to provide services and for payment purposes. If Infolinks has trouble processing an order, it will use this information to contact the web publisher. Infolinks may disclose such information to pay processers and similar functions.
  * **Web Publisher Service Agreement:** If a web publisher signs a service agreement, Infolinks requires the web publisher to provide certain identifiable information including: name, company name, street address, email and telephone number.

The other e-mails we send out are in response to feedback, contact and sign-up form submissions, and to enhance the value of services we provide. Generally, a web publisher or advertiser may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If a web publisher or advertiser does not wish to receive these communications, they have the option to deactivate their account according to the terms of their Web Services Agreement.
  * **Customer Service:** Based upon the provided personally identifiable information, Infolinks will send web publishers a welcoming email to verify their username and password and to set up their account.
