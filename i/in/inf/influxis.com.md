# Privacy Policy - Influxis

In the case of Clients, Client shall be responsible for (i) informing their customers (“End Users”), if any, of the existence of this Privacy Policy and (ii) agreeing to this Privacy Policy, as amended, updated or modified from time to time, on behalf of his, her or its End Users.
  * In the case of End Users, (a person who uses a Client’s application or website that incorporates the Influxis Service) Influxis has no direct relationship with such End User and Influxis will not collect their Personal Data directly from them. In the event an End User seeks to access, correct, amend or delete data, the End User should contact Influxis’ Client.
  * If you are a person who has directly signed up with Influxis for the use of Influxis’ Services and you seek to access, correct, amend, or delete data, you should contact Influxis directly. If requested to remove data under either scenario, Influxis will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

  * In the case of an End User, if End User utilizes a Client’s website or application that incorporates Influxis’ Service, depending on how the Client has implemented our Service we may receive End Users’ Personal Data from Client to transmit across our Service and store on behalf of Client. In this case, the End User should direct all requests regarding the Personal Data collected directly to the Client.

When you view a page on Influxis’ website, an e-mail or an advertisement, your web browser will request the web beacon from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This unique identifier will be linked to log information that is used to track your usage of Influxis’ website in order to determine the effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns.
