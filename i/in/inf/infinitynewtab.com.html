Your participation is voluntary and you have the choice not to disclose any information that we request.</p>
            <p>The types of information we gather:</p>
            <p>
                Information you provide: We receive and store any information you enter on the Browsing Products Domains or give us in any other way.

You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing and improving our services, delivering targeted content and advertisements that may be of interest to you, and communicating with you.</p>
            <p>
                Automatic information we collect from the plugin: When you use Browsing Product plugin, the searches you perform using our domains, the ways in which you use various features, and the pages you view on our domains. For example, we may collect information about page views, impressions and clicks, as well as similar web usage information on our domains.

            <p>
                Automatic information we collect from the site: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our site. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Site, when you use the plugin.</p>
