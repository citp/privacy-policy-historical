# Privacy Policy | Informz

Informz has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Because we gather important information from our customers and visitors, we have established this as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.

#### Information Collection and Usage

Informz requires customers who request information, and subsequently register to use our products and services to provide contact information such as their name, company name, address, phone number and email address and later financial qualification and billing information such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the customer’s organization. Informz typically asks for additional information when a customer or visitor requests information about our products and services. This information often includes title, department, fax number and additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees, and industry. Customers and visitors can choose to “opt out” of providing this additional information.

Informz uses the collected information to set up accounts for customers and their respective companies. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss their interest in Informz, our products and services and to send information on Informz, our partners, and notices of promotions and upcoming events, if the customer or visitor has so opted to receive these communications. Informz customers will automatically be subscribed to our email newsletter as part of the set up process. All customers have the opportunity to choose to opt-out from receiving our newsletter. Customer information will not be shared or distributed.

Except as explicitly stated at the time Informz requests information, we do not disclose to any third party the information provided. All financial and billing information we collect is used solely to check qualifications of prospective customers and to invoice our customers for their usage of Informz products and services. This billing information is not used by Informz for marketing and/or promotional purposes.

Informz uses a third party for credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

Informz uses pixel tags and other methods to gather information about the emails we send to our registered users and recipients of emails sent by our registered users to others. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient’s computer will access Informz’s servers to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing Informz to record and store information such as email address, date and time the recipient viewed the email message, if the recipient’s email program is capable of receiving HTML, and other logging information. Informz uses this information to optimize delivery of future messages to specific recipients and to provide information to registered users with respect to emails they send through the Informz System.

Informz maintains log files tracking IP addresses to analyze trends, help diagnose problems with our servers and to monitor traffic/usage in order to provide better service to our customers and visitors. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Informz uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to improve the convenience and efficiency of your experience when using our products and services. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive tied to statistical information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information in Informz products and email messages. You can always choose to not accept cookies, but you may not be able to use some of the Informz products and services.

#### A Note to Recipients of Email Messages from Informz Users

Informz does not retain email address information after our users cancel their service. Informz does not monitor or limit our users from creating email messages. We do, however, quickly respond to notification of violations or abuses of Informz Terms of Service, including failure to honor opt-outs.

#### Other Information

Users of Informz will place email address lists and digital content on Informz’s servers. Informz does not monitor content or review lists. Informz’s servers use the content to construct email messages and the address lists to deliver messages. Informz will not use user-provided content or email address lists for any purpose whatsoever other than to construct and send messages as intended by the user providing the list and/or content. Email lists will never be used by Informz for solicitation nor will they ever be provided to any third party or be accessible through Informz by any user other than the user providing the list.

#### Disclosure of Data

Informz will only disclose your Data (as defined collectively above under the topic Information Collection and Usage), the contents of your private communications, or the contact information of your recipients if required to do so by law, or as otherwise stated in this Statement, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Informz; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Informz and others, including among other things to enforce our Terms of Service; (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members or the public; (4) to correct technical problems and malfunctions in how we provide our service to you and to technically process your information; (5) to take precautions against liability; (6) to respond to claims that information you have submitted to Informz has violated the rights or interests of a third party; or (7) as permitted by law or to provide information to law enforcement agencies.
