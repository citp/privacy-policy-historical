                                <p>CMP MEDIA LLC and its affiliates CME LLC, CMP HEALTHCARE MEDIA LLC, CMP HEALTHCARE MEDIA GROUP LLC , Shorecliff Holdings LLC, and CMP-Cybermedia LLC (collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as "we" or "CMP") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites, subscribers to our magazines, registrants for our events, recipients of our e-mail newsletters and all other customers of our products and services. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our customers' right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our customers. This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for all products and services owned by CMP. A current list of our publications, web sites, online webcasts, newsletters and trade shows can be found at <a href="http://www.cmp.com.com/">http://www.cmp.com/</a>.</p>
                                <p> <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong><br>
                                  CMP collects
                                    information from our website users, subscribers
                                    and other customers. In this section of our
                                    Privacy Statement, we describe the type of
                                    information we collect and how we use it
                                to provide better services to our customers.</p>
                                <p> <strong>Registration and Ordering</strong>                                  <br>When attending our trade shows and other in-person events, participating in our customer-sponsored webcasts, using some of our websites and signing up for certain selected services (such as free subscriptions), users must first register. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to provide a more personalized experience on our sites. We also may collect information about a user's professional responsibilities (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional certification). We use such information to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or for industry reporting purposes.</p>
                                <p>Many of our products and services are free
                                  to subscribers who meet certain demographic
                                  criteria. Independent auditors may need to
                                  certify the eligibility of these subscribers.
                                  In order to do that, we may collect unique
                                  identifiers (such as mother's maiden name)
                                  that we disclose to the auditors strictly for
                                  industry reporting and audit verification purposes.
                                </p>
                                <p>For our services that require payment (such
                                  as certain events, products and subscriptions),
                                    we also collect credit card information (such
                                    as account name, number and expiration date),
                                    which is used for our or our agent's billing
                                    purposes only, and is not otherwise shared.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>E-mail Newsletters</strong> <br>If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address, phone number) and information about the subscriber's professional interests and responsibilities. We use this information in the same manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process described above. Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter.</p><p><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong><br>
  								  From time to time we invite web site users and other customers to provide
                                  information via surveys or contests. Participation
                                  in these surveys or contests is completely
                                  voluntary and the website user or other customer
                                  therefore has a choice whether to disclose
                                  requested contact information (such as name
                                  and mailing address) and demographic information
                                  (such as zip code or job title). In addition
                                  to the other uses set forth in this policy,
                                  contact information collected in connection
                                  with surveys and contests is used to notify
                                  the winners and award prizes and to monitor
                                  or improve the use of, and satisfaction with
                                  the website or other CMP product or service.
                                  Subject to the given customer's preferences
                                  (as described in the "Permission" section below), such information
                                    also may be shared with third party sponsors
                                    of such surveys or contests.

                                <p><strong>Interactive Features</strong>                                  <br>
                                  At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community features such
                                  as discussion boards, webcasts and user profiles.
                                  Note that all personal information sent or
                                  posted via such features becomes public information
                                  for which we are not responsible.
    </p>
                                <p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong>        <br>
                                  If customers elect to use our referral service
                                    for informing a friend about our sites and
                                    services, we may ask them for the friend's
                                    name, job title and e-mail address. CMP will
                                    store and use this information to send the
                                    friend an invitation. This information may
                                    also be used to provide information about
                                    our company and related products and services.
                                    The friend may contact us as specified in
                                    the tell-a-friend message to request that
                                    no further communications be sent.
                                </p>

                                  We have features where our customers can submit information to us (such
                                    as our feedback forms). Where such submissions
                                        include requests for service, support
                                  or information, we may forward them to our
                                  agents, as needed, to best respond to the specific
                                    request. In addition, we may retain e-mails
                                    and other information sent to us for our
                                  internal administrative purposes, and to help
                                  us to serve customers better. Please note that
                                  letters to the editor and similar submissions
                                may be made public. </p>
                                <p><strong>Communications from Us:

                                  In order to
                                  best serve our customers, we may send updates
                                  that contain important information about our
                                  products and services. For example, we send
                                  new members a welcoming message, and verify
                                  password and username for our password-protected
                                  web sites. We may also communicate with a customer
                                  to provide requested services and for account-related
                                    issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail.
                                  In addition to such service and product-essential
                                    messages, we offer our customers the option
                                    to receive information about our company,
                                  related products, services and special deals.
                                  Users, however, can choose not to receive these
                                  communications from us, as set forth in the "Permission" section below.

                                  </strong><br>
                                  Our web sites, newsletters and, from time to time, certain other
                                  products and services have features that automatically
                                  collect information from customers, to deliver
                                  content specific to customers' interests and
                                  to honor their preferences. This information
                                  assists us in creating products and services
                                  that will serve the needs of our customers.

                                <p>For example, we use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive
            containing information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring

            the user may not be able to participate in sweepstakes, contests or drawings.
            Additionally, we may note some of the pages the user visits on our web sites
            and via our email newsletters through the use of pixel tags (also called clear

                                <p>In addition, some of our business affiliates
                                  use cookies on our web sites and in our email
                                  newsletters, in ads or promotions. However,
                                  we have no access to or control over these
                                  business affiliates' cookies; we urge users
                                  to read their privacy policies for information.
                                In particular, we use third-party advertising technology to serve ads for CMP products and services when you visit certain CMP Web sites. This technology uses information about your visits to these CMP Web sites (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising for CMP products and services. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits these sites and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web sites. The information used in this process is not personally identifiable.

                                <p> We also use an email delivery and marketing
                                  company to send emails (including newsletters)
                                  for which you have registered (or otherwise
                                  agreed to receive). Web beacons and cookies
                                  may be used in such email messages to help
                                  us measure the effectiveness of our advertising
                                  and how customers use our web sites and other
                                products and services. </p>
                                <p>For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of all visitors to our web sites.

                                <p>We may combine information supplied by a customer at registration with web site usage data to learn more about users and their preferences in the content of the site.

                                <p>These sponsors will use the information according to their own privacy policies,
                                  and we urge participants to read those policies and be aware of their privacy
                                  practices before registering. </p>
                                <p>If you register for the Techonline network of sites, information which you submit at registration may be shared with third party sponsors if you access their white papers and resources or register for events they sponsor.</p>
								<p>Finally, on occasion,
                                  we may provide targeted lists of names and
                                  offline and online contact information for
                                  marketing purposes to third parties, subject
                  to our Permission policies, as described below, pursuant to
                                  which we give customers the option of not having

                </p>
								<p>Other than as set forth above, we do not share personally identifiable information with other companies, apart from those acting as our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, entities into which our company may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal information. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission. We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others.</p>

                                  on information released prior to the implementation
