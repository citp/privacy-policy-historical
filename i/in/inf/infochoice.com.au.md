# Privacy Statement | InfoChoice

### Information we will collect

We are subject to the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).  This Privacy Policy explains in general terms how we protect the privacy of your personal information under the National Privacy Principles.  It also sets out the matters which are required to disclose to individuals under National Privacy Principles 1.3 and 1.5. The principles set out in this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information you provide to InfoChoice via our website or under any other agreement or arrangement and to information which we collect about you from other sources.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to acts and practices of InfoChoice which relate directly to the employee records of our current or former employees.

No information that could be used to personally identify a user will be collected, unless the user specifically enters such data in a form, 'email to friend' link or any other part of our website. Personally identifiable information means your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.

We utilise "cookies" (small text files placed on a user's computer by our web page server) which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and usage statistics, and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance. These cookies contain data such as the pages you visit, the path you take through our website, the type of browser you are using, and your computer's I.P. address. Again, no personal information is stored or used.

We also use cookies to collect anonymous aggregate information on consumer preferences for various products and services. This helps us to improve the site to give you the information, services and features you want. We do not link this information to individual users. If you are an Infochoice member, you are given the option of having your cookie log you in automatically. This allows you to browse unimpeded on return visits and ensures you are greeted appropriately. You will be able to decline this automatic log-in if you wish.

### How we will use and disclose collected information

We will use and disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected. We may also use and disclose personal information for purposes related or ancillary to the main reason we collect it. We may (unless you tell us not to) disclose personal information we collect to third parties for the purposes of allowing them to direct market their products and services.

We engage third party contractors to perform services for us which involves the contractor handling personal information we hold. For example, we engage third party contractors to provide part time services on an ad hoc basis, for example client services and office management. In these situations, we prohibit the third party contractor from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.

We may disclose your personal information on a confidential basis to:   
•    our suppliers, contractors and agents for the purpose of providing services to us so that we can supply you;   
•    our related bodies corporate and other organisations with whom we have alliances or arrangements, and their contractors and agents;   
•    entities that provide you with services;   
•    suppliers of information technology services, so that they may provide those services; and   
•    law enforcement, regulatory and government bodies, government agencies and courts as and when required by law.

You may, pursuant to the Privacy Act 1988, obtain a copy of any personal information relating to you which may be in our possession. To make any enquiries about accessing your personal information you may contact us on (02) 8507 7196.

### Links to other websites

Links to other websites are not covered by this policy. Where any link is provided to any third party for any reason, such link is provided in good faith but we do not endorse or approve such third party or the information provided by such third party. We have no control over and accept no responsibility for the contents of any third party website or the information provided by such third party, whether in relation to providing a service to you, others or us. All offers and statements on products or services available on any third party website or any information provided by such third party are the responsibility of and given by such third party and shall be subject to their terms of use. We expressly disclaim acting in any other respect on behalf of any such third party. If any mistake or misrepresentation occurs on any such website or otherwise in any information provided by such third party, the responsibility lies solely with such third party. Due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that such links will be effective at all times.

We may receive payments from the operator of any third party website in relation to products or services supplied by such operator as a result of you contacting such operator or linking to such third party website from this website.

Software downloads via links from this website are third party products. These products may be subject to a licence agreement between you and the relevant product owner. To the extent permitted by law, we accept no liability in respect of such third party products and we provide no warranty and give no endorsement in respect of such products or any party connected to them.
