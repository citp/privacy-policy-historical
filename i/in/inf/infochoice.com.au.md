**2\. How we collect information about you**  
InfoChoice collects user information via the use of 'cookies'. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept these cookies, however if you do not wish to receive any cookies you can set your browser to refuse them.

We also use cookies to collect anonymous aggregate information on consumer preferences for various products and services. This helps us to improve the site to give you the information, services and features you want. We do not link this information to individual users.

If you are an InfoChoice member, you are given the option of having your cookie log you in automatically. This allows you to browse unimpeded on return visits and ensures you are greeted appropriately. You will be able to decline this automatic log-in if you wish.

**3\. How we store your information and keep it secure**  
InfoChoice will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep any information that we have about you secure, and to ensure that all personal information we have relating to you is correct and up-to-date.
