# InfoSpace Visitor Privacy Policy - InfoSpace

| **InfoSpace  Visitor Privacy Policy** |    
---|---  
  
**Except as provided in this Visitor Privacy Policy, InfoSpace  does not disclose individually identifiable information about its visitors to any third party without that visitor's consent.**

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/547) **TRUSTe Certification**

InfoSpace is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the InfoSpace Web site located at www.infospace.com. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

This Web site has agreed to participate in TRUSTe's formal resolution process. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our [Customer Service Department](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/about/feedback.htm). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry within five business days or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.  
  
**Privacy Philosophy**

The information provided in this Visitor Privacy Policy covers your interactions on the different areas of the InfoSpace Web site referenced above (excludes the co-branded pages of our partners and affiliates). As a company, InfoSpace believes strongly in protecting consumer privacy, and it is InfoSpace's goal to allow our visitors to provide as much or as little information as they feel comfortable.  
  
**Information Gathered**

InfoSpace gathers information about our visitors that allows us to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well.

Occasionally we ask you to provide us certain personal information such as your name, email address, or a list of your interests and hobbies. You never have to answer these questions, although not answering them may limit the services that we can offer you. On certain pages, credit card numbers are collected in order to conduct a transaction. We utilize a third party to process your credit card transaction.

In order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), InfoSpace does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. 

In order to provide you with a personalized experience and also monitor the traffic patterns on our site, InfoSpace uses a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to track content preferences and traffic patterns. The cookie may contain a number or other information which reminds us who you are when you visit our site. This browser feature is valuable to you because it alleviates the need to re-register for services each time you visit our site and because it allows us to better understand traffic patterns throughout our Web site (keep track of how often visitors visit a particular part of our site) so we can offer our visitors the most popular and useful content and services available. 

You may choose not to accept cookies by changing the preferences on your browser. However, your experience will be less personalized and, in addition, certain services may not be available for your use (See below, "Use of the Information").

Other companies that advertise on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you. You may choose not to accept such cookies by changing the preferences on your browser. To find out which advertising firms InfoSpace uses from time to time, see our list of [Advertising Partners](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/about/advertising_providers.htm).

Although you may visit our site anonymously, you may elect to provide us with information you want InfoSpace to remember. We hope that you will want to provide information about yourself to InfoSpace because it will make our Web site more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users. One example of where we collect personal information to serve you better is the My InfoSpace section of our Web site where we collect information to provide you with stock quotes, weather, and lottery results. Our [Chat Rooms](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/chat/index.htm) are another example of such an enhanced service. In these instances, we retain information about you between sessions by using the cookies described above.

From time to time, InfoSpace will conduct surveys in order to help serve you better. Participation in the surveys is optional and anonymous.  
  
**Use of the Information**

InfoSpace always tries to provide you with a compelling reason to come back and visit our site again:

We use the information gathered from you to provide personalized portions of our site that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving. My InfoSpace is a good example of such a personalized service. 

We analyze what our customers like and don't like about InfoSpace's current offerings so that we can design better services. We use information about what you are searching for to help focus our energies on the services that we offer, hopefully to make them more valuable to you. 

We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "48,000 people clicked on Advertisement "X" today and, of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." The people that make it possible for you to use InfoSpace for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are.  
  
**Information Distribution**

Other companies which place advertising or content on our site may collect information about you by way of cookies when you view or click on their advertising or content. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. To find out which advertising firms InfoSpace uses from time to time, see our list of [Advertising Partners](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/about/advertising_providers.htm). Refer to the section below for information on content providers. On certain pages, credit card numbers are collected in order to conduct a transaction. We utilize a third-party to process your credit card transaction.

Additionally, although partners, affiliates and third parties may link to our Web site, or otherwise be associated with our Web site, InfoSpace cannot control the information collection and distribution policies of such parties. Although we do encourage our partners and affiliates, including co-branding partners, to adopt privacy policies similar to this one, we do not have control over the practices of third parties and these practices may differ from our own. You should check the privacy policy of every Web site you visit to ensure that you are comfortable with the practices of that particular Web site.  
  
**Content Providers**

Almost all of the information and activities that are found on the various areas of the InfoSpace Web site are a result of content that is provided by our partners and associates. Since some of these activities involve inputting personal information, this is an issue that needs to be addressed in our Visitor Privacy Policy.

There are many instances where personal information that is entered is used by one of our content providers. In these cases, the content provider receives any information that you provide, and that information is subject to the privacy policy of that provider. 

An example of this process is signing up for our [Real Time Quotes service](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/rtq/index.htm). Although the sign-up process is done while never leaving the InfoSpace Web site, the information that is gathered goes to [freerealtime.com](http://www.freerealtime.com/), and is subject to the Privacy Policy of that organization.

Some of our other content providers may include from time to time, but are not limited to:

  * [American Singles](http://www.as.org/)  

  * [One & Only Photo Personals](http://www.one-and-only.com/menu1.htm?AssociateID=22422)  

  * [Match.com](http://www.match.com/link.cgi/858859315907/welcome.tpl)  

  * [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/)  

  * [Leisure Planet](http://www.leisureplanet.com/)  

  * [Astrology.net](http://astrology.net/)

If at any time you are uncertain about whether or not your personal information will be provided to InfoSpace or the content provider, please feel free to contact our Customer Service Department.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

InfoSpace may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on InfoSpace; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of InfoSpace, the site or the users of InfoSpace, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of InfoSpace, the site or the public. InfoSpace may also disclose personal information with the user's consent, whether by opt-in, opt-out or other form of consent.

Various InfoSpace services allow for information provided by users to be immediately posted in a public forum. Examples include chat rooms and message boards (see below), classifieds, White Pages, Yellow Pages and other services. Users providing information to such services should be familiar with the service and its public nature, and realize that the privacy of such information cannot be protected.  
  
**Unsolicited Contact**

InfoSpace does not allow third parties to send promotional email to its users without such user's consent. InfoSpace may send administrative emails to confirm user registrations or to update users concerning new services or opportunities with InfoSpace. Some of these emails may contain information about the services of our partners. We may send out promotional emails on behalf of our partners to those users who have demonstrated an interest in receiving such solicitations.  
  
**Chat and Message Board Disclaimer**

Information that you disclose about yourself in a public chat room, message board or other public forum will immediately become available to anyone who has access to those public areas. We cannot protect the privacy of information disclosed in these forums. While utilizing these areas, please restrict your disclosure of personal information to any information that you are willing to have available to the public.  
  
**Correcting and Updating**

There are many options available to users to update the information that they have listed in our database.

  * Yellow Pages: You may be able to add a business or personal Web site to the Companies Online directory by visiting our [submission page](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/submit.htm). It will probably take approximately thirty (30) days for us to verify the submission and add your site to our directory. At this time, to request a change to your Web site listing, you must submit a new listing and delete the old one. The option to delete the old listing will be available to you when you find your Web site listing. 
  * White Pages: You may update or delete your White Pages listing by searching the [White Pages](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/index_ppl.htm) or [email search](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/email1.htm) directory to find your listing. Once you have located it, simply click the **update** or **remove** link to the right of your name. To verify your request, InfoSpace will send an email message to the address that you provide. Once you confirm the request, your listing will be updated or deleted.  

  * Chat Rooms: Only your username will be seen by other participants. All of the other information you provide (including your actual name and email address) will not be available to the other participants. The additional information is kept for the purpose of managing your account. Once your username and password have been accepted, you will be unable to update any of this information (except for changing your password). To change your password, follow the instructions available in the "Help" section of the Chat Rooms.  

  * My InfoSpace: To update your user information, including your password, point your browser to [My InfoSpace](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/my.htm). Log in with your user name and password if prompted, and then click the "My InfoSpace" button. Select the "Update" option in the upper left corner and follow the prompts. In order to change your user name, you must re-register. Please refer to our [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/faq2.htm), or feel free to contact our [Customer Service Department](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/about/feedback.htm) with any questions that you have. 

  
  
**Notification of Changes**

InfoSpace reserves the right to change this Visitor Privacy Policy from time to time. If InfoSpace changes this Visitor Privacy Policy with respect to the disclosure of your personally identifiable information, we will post a notice of such change on this Web site or contact users by email or other communication to obtain consent. We welcome any questions or comments you have; please send them to our [Customer Service Department](http://www.infospace.com/_1_4PDLTUC03GBBJMF__info/about/feedback.htm).
