Unless you directly give us consent to do otherwise, Catch will only collect and use your personal information as set out below.<br><br><span class="title_2small">Collection of information</span><br><br>The four main ways we collect personal information about you are:<br>
<ul>
<li>When information about you is posted on a Catch website, either by you or by a third party; </li>
<li>When you log into a Catch website or otherwise submit personal information to Catch; </li>
<li>When you use a Catch website, in which case our system automatically collects information relating to your visit to that website, such as your IP address; and</li>
<li>Through the operation of CatchBot, Catch's web crawler (described in more detail below).</li></ul><span class="title_2small">Our use of cookies</span><br><br>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.

<li>The use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted by this policy;</li>
<li>It is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws);</li>
<li>We believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;</li>
<li>To protect the rights, property or personal safety of another Catch website user, any member of the public or Catch; or</li>
