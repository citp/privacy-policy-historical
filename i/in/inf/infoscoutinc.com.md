We may collect the following types of information: 

#### Information you provide

We receive and store the information you enter on ScoutIt, Inc. websites or mobile applications or you otherwise provide us in any other way, for example, where we are the service provider for a Rewards Program. Wherever we provide examples of information in this Privacy Policy, the examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list.

We may receive information about your purchases from Participating Retailers.

#### Award information

We will maintain records to keep track of the Awards you earn.

#### Information from cookies

When you visit a ScoutIt, Inc. website or click on a banner advertisement, we may send one or more cookies to your computer or other device.

Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in our server logs. During some visits to our websites we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

#### Information from other sources

We may receive information about you from various sources. This may include estimated demographic information from data collection companies and others in order for us to offer anonymous market research reports to clients and partners.

We may link Nonpersonal Information about you with any Personal Information we have.

## How does ScoutIt, Inc. use my information?

#### To manage your Account(s)

We use the information we collect to manage your Account(s). For example, we use the information you provide us and the purchase information we collect to track, process, post and fulfill Awards you earn and to provide customer service. In addition, we may use this information to keep you informed of new features and product developments as well as to provide more relevant offers to you.

#### To contact you

We may use the contact information we receive from you or third parties to contact you via email, direct mail, telephone or other channels such as text messaging, Facebook and Twitter, in each case provided we are permitted by law to send such communications to you and you have not otherwise opted-out of receiving them. For example, we may, on behalf of or at the request of, the Rewards Program Sponsor(s) for the Rewards Program(s) you participate in, use your contact information to send you emails about our products or services and/or the product and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others. We may also use your contact information to provide you administrative communications from time to time.

#### For market research purposes

We use the information we collect to provide clients with anonymous market research reports. For example, “What percentage of Females in the Midwest buy Brand X products?” We may also partner with third-party market research companies who may leverage the data to support the creation of their own anonymous market research reports based on proprietary data they collect via other sources. However, your data shall NOT be sold to third-parties for the purposes of marketing to you.

#### To develop, evaluate, improve and deliver our products and services

We use the information we collect to develop, evaluate, improve and deliver our product and services, and the products and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others.

#### To deliver personalized advertisements and other information to you

We may use the information we collect to deliver advertisements about our products and services, and/or the products and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others on our websites, other websites, mobile applications, or in other marketing channels. For example, we may use the purchase information we collect about you because of your participation in one or more Rewards Program(s) to deliver to you, via one or more of those channels, advertisements that we, or the parties whose products or services we are promoting, think may be of interest to you. We also may engage third party advertising networks to deliver these advertisements. These networks use cookies and similar technologies to personalize the advertising content you see and to measure the effectiveness of the advertisements they deliver. These companies are authorized to use the information we provide and they collect when you navigate to a website within the ad network to provide this service to us.

#### Fulfill legal and regulatory requirements

We may use the information we collect to comply with federal, state, or other applicable laws and regulations.

#### Protect the rights or property of ScoutIt, Inc. or our Registered Users
