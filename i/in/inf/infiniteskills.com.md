#### Praise for O'Reilly

I have purchased learning photoshop cs6 ( author: Andy Anderson) and I just had to write on what an excellent course. Andy does a wonderful job teaching such a complex software look easy and with humor. He provides so much information that I occasionally have to go back to the lessons for notes. Please continue making such excellent courses and tell Mr. Anderson to please make another photoshop course part 2. Richard A.
