We may also obtain information about you from other sources, as far as such other sources are legally entitled to share such information, and combine that information with information we have collected from you. 

##  *** Web Site Registration**

We may also collect demographic information such as your gender and birth date, which we may combine with your personal information and use it for marketing purposes. Once this information is combined it is all considered personal information. Information collected from those who register on our websites or other online properties is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletters; access to the latest game news and contests; message boards, chat rooms or forums; and product registration.). From time to time, we may contact you to ask you for your opinion about certain matters in the form of online polls or surveys, including your opinion with respect to our games or other products and services.

##  **What are “Cookies” and does Activision use cookies, track IP Addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?**

Activision uses cookies on its websites and other online properties. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many websites and other online properties often store on a user's computer or device in order to anonymously identify it and associate activity with it. Cookies typically do not include people's names, or e-mail addresses. 

When visiting our websites and other online services you can choose whether or not to let us enable cookies. We use cookies to optimize your visit, make your browsing experience as effective as possible, and let you know about offers that we think will interest you. This means that if you refuse, your use of our websites and other online properties may be impaired as a result. 

Depending on the Activision website or other online property you are using, and the country you are based in, cookies may be set on your computer or device by either: 

Activision - to recognize and associate activity with your computer or device when it visits an Activision website or other online property. Activision cookies cannot be used to recognize or associate activity with your computer or device when it visits other, third party websites or online properties. 

Third Parties – to enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through Activision's websites or other online properties (e.g. advertising and analytics). The third parties that set these cookies can recognize your computer or device both when it visits Activision websites or other online properties in question and also when it visits certain other non-Activision websites or online properties that use the third party's features and functionality 

##  **Types Of Cookies**

  * _Strictly Necessary Cookies_




These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around websites or online properties and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of a website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like secure login areas, cannot be provided. 

  * _Performance (or Analytics) Cookies_




These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website or online property, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are only used to improve how a website or other online property works. We generally contract with independent research and measurement companies, such as Google Analytics, to provide these services on our behalf and which may also be subject to their own privacy policies. 

  * _Functionality Cookies_




These cookies allow the website or online property to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. 

  * _Advertising Cookies_

    * These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website or online property operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. In certain countries our websites may partner with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver advertisements, products, services, and promotions on our websites and other online properties, as well as advertisements, products, services, and promotions on websites and other online properties which we do not control. To help select the ads of greatest interest to you, these companies may use cookies, Flash technology, and similar technologies to collect and track non-personal information such as demographic information (e.g., gender, occupation, etc.), aggregated information, search keywords, geo-location and online data (for example, clickstream data such as browser type, language, IP address, time/date) to select advertisements that are more relevant to your interests, to better personalize the experience for you and tailor advertisements. In some instances, we may allow third-party companies to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.

    * To learn more about Advertising Cookies visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at [http://networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/) or [http://youronlinechoices.com](http://youronlinechoices.com/)

##  **Permission to Use Cookies**

If a cookies choice setting is not available through either the third party provider listed in Appendix 1, your browser, or at <http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> or [http://youronlinechoices.com](http://youronlinechoices.com/) then by using the applicable Activision website or other online property you agree, and we will assume you consent, to receive cookies through that Activision website or other online property.

##  **Flash cookies and web beacons**

Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows sites to deploy dynamic web content. Adobe Flash and similar applications use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage in ways that are similar to browser cookies, but are managed through a different interface than your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from http://www.adobe.com/ directly to manage your cookie settings. 

From time to time, we may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or other online properties or include them in the e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs") are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. 

We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. 

Activision may use and share non-personally identifiable (e.g., anonymized or aggregated) information obtained from cookies with third parties such as service providers or advertising partners. An example of the use of such information would be an anonymous group that we assign to an interest categories or segment such as region, gaming preferences, or a combination. We may also share non-personally identifiable information obtained from cookies with third parties such as service providers or advertising networks in order to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving advertisements for us or our advertising partners.
