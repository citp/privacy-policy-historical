4.3 While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web.

**5 Cookies**

5.1 When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful, and reliable. Where services are delivered on the Internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through (for example):

5.1.1 enabling a service to recognize your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task

5.1.2 recognizing that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested

5.1.3 measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast

If you do not accept cookies you will be unable to use this website. You can, however, manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through [Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them](https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies "Government information on browsing cookies").

5.2 Advertising space on certain parts of the Site is managed and sold by a third party advertising broker. That broker uses cookies, beacons and other technologies in order to better target messages. When you click on an advertisement, you will leave our website and go to another site. We have no control over, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, any third party sites or content or to any collection of data after you click on an advertisement or link to a third party site.
