# Privacy – Infoserve

#### Information we may collect from you

We may collect and process the following information about you:

Information that you provide us with by completing forms on our website, for example information provided at the time of registering to use our website or purchasing our services.

We may also collect anonymous information on your browsing activity whilst logged on to our website, such as IP address, browser type, access times and referring URL.

#### What we use this information for

We use the information held about you in the following ways:

To help us to understand your needs and improve the relevance of the services we offer you as an individual.

To provide you with information (either by telephone, email, post or any other method), about products or services that you request from us or which we feel may be of interest to you.

To carry out our obligations arising from any contract that you have entered into with us.

To allow you to fully participate in all the features of our website.

To keep you up-to-date about any changes to our services.

#### Personal Information

In terms of the personal information you submit when becoming a user or a customer, this is held with the utmost commitment to your privacy.

The information is stored on a secure web server and in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998; we have added security measures in place to ensure that your personal information has adequate protection. This not only applies to your contact details but your credit/debit card details as well.

When payments are made to Infoserve Ltd, we regard security and convenience as top priorities and we only use established and secure methods such as Barclaycard EPDQ and CardStream.

If you use a web-based payment page to pay for products or services, the credit/debit card details you submit are encapsulated using Barclaycard EPDQ’s encrypted and digitally-signed protocol. This is done using Secure Socket Layer (SSL), the industry standard for transmitting confidential information on the web using data encryption, ensuring that the information passed on to us is secure and tamper-proof. However SSL has been designed to work with most popular browsers and you are advised to use an up-to-date version of your browser to take advantage of this added security.

We believe that your privacy is important and have security in place to protect it. However if this security is breached we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

#### Browsing our website

You cannot be identified personally as a result of the information we collect while you browse the site and we mainly examine browsing activity to monitor aggregated site traffic and analyse it.

We may also provide anonymous statistics about user and customer browsing activity to reputable third party vendors, but these will not include details that would allow the recipient to identify you.
