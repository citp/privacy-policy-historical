    <p>Infolinks is a Publisher-side Technology Company. Publisher-side means that all of our solutions reside on the individual servers of the websites we partner with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Infolinks' technologies are not downloaded to a user's desktop.</li>
<li>Infolinks' technologies do not upload personally identifiable information from a user's desktop.</li>
<li>Infolinks' technologies do not collect or store any personally identifiable user information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Infolinks, Inc. ("Infolinks") respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infolinks.com/">www.infolinks.com</a>&nbsp;(the "Website"). Infolinks thus provides this privacy policy to explain what information is gathered during a visit to the Website and how such information may be used.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">Use of Information:</span></p>
<p>As a general policy no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Website. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of Infolinks' Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">Specific uses of information on the Website may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infolinks' Inquiry Form:</strong>&nbsp;The Infolinks Website contains an "inquiry form" for web publishers to request additional information about Infolinks' products/services. The inquiry form requires web publishers to give contact information (such as name and email address.) Infolinks uses this information to contact Web Publishers about the services on the Website in which they have expressed interest.</li>
<li>Web Publishers have the option to provide demographic information (such as website address and vertical sector) to Infolinks. Infolinks encourages them to submit this information so it can provide them a more customized reply to their inquiry.</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials:</strong>&nbsp;If your name appears in a testimonial on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information displayed there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this website, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these testimonials.</li>
<li><strong>Web Publisher Sign-up form:</strong>&nbsp;When a Web Publisher signs a service agreement with Infolinks, the Web Publisher is also required to provide company and personal identity information, commercial information, technical contact information and customization information to start their contextual advertising services. Infolinks uses this information to provide services and for payment purposes. If Infolinks has trouble processing an order, it will use this information to contact the Web Publisher.</li>
<li><strong>Web Publisher Service Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;If a Web Publisher signs a service agreement, Infolinks requires the Web Publisher to provide certain identifiable information including: name, company name, street address, email and telephone number. This information is necessary to process the Web Publisher's agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Network Service Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;When an Advertising Network signs a service agreement with Infolinks, the Advertising Network is also required to provide company, personal identity information and commercial information. Infolinks uses this information to provide services and for payment purposes. If Infolinks has trouble processing an order, it will use this information to contact the Advertising Network.</li>
<li><strong>Insertion Orders:</strong>&nbsp;If an advertiser purchases a service from Infolinks, Infolinks requests certain personal and company identity information from the advertiser on the insertion form. Advertisers must provide contact information (such as name, company name, street address, email and telephone number) and financial information. Infolinks uses this information to provide services and for billing purposes. If Infolinks has trouble processing an order, it will use this information to contact the advertiser.</li>
<li><strong>Service-related Announcements:</strong>&nbsp;Infolinks will send Web Publishers service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. The only other e-mails we send out are in response to feedback, contact and sign-up form submissions.</li>
<li>Generally, a Web Publisher may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If a Web Publisher does not wish to receive these communications, they have the option to deactivate their account according to the terms of their Web Services Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Service:</strong>&nbsp;Based upon the provided personally identifiable information, Infolinks will send Web Publishers a welcoming email to verify their username and password and to set up their account. Infolinks will also communicate with them in response to their inquiries, to provide the services they request, and to manage their account. Infolinks will communicate with Web Publishers by email or telephone, in accordance with their wishes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong>&nbsp;Infolinks may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with Infolinks' rights or property, other users of the Website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Infolinks may also disclose user information when necessary to comply with a court order, legal process or other legal proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Children Age 12 and Under:</strong>&nbsp;Infolinks recognizes the special obligation to protect personally identifiable information obtained from children age 12 and under. AS SUCH, IF YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER, INFOLINKS REQUESTS THAT YOU NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE WEBSITE OR TO INFOLINKS. If Infolinks discovers that a child age 12 or younger has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally identifiable information from our records.</p>

You always have the option of removing your name from any e-mail list in order to discontinue any such future communications.
