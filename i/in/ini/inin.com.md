However, there are times when we may need and request Personal Data from you so that we can better serve you. 

Interactive Intelligence will only collect Personal Data (such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address, employer name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) when it is voluntarily submitted to us at the Sites. We will use this information to comply with your request for information or as otherwise disclosed to you at the location on the Sites at which you submit your information. For example, if you request technical support assistance, we need to know who you are, what product you are using and in what computer system environment you are using the product in order to respond to your request as efficiently and effectively as possible. If you are interested in signing up for one of our Webinars, the Personal Data you provide to us will enable us to tailor the Webinar more closely to your specific needs.
