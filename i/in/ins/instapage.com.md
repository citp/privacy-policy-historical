“ **EEA** ” means, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland.

“ **Processing** ” has the meaning given to it in the GDPR and “process” , “processes” and “processed” shall be interpreted accordingly.

“ **Services** ” means any product or service provided by Instapage to Customer pursuant to this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and DPA.

There are three general categories of information we collect.

  * **Geo-location Information.** When you use certain features of the Instapage Platform, we may collect information about your precise or approximate location as determined through data such as your IP address or mobile device’s GPS to offer you an improved user experience.

Instapage may disclose your information, including personal information, to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against Instapage, (iii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iv) to enforce and administer our [Terms of Service](https://instapage.com/terms-of-service), or other agreements with Users, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Instapage, its employees, its Users, or members of the public.

Where appropriate, we may notify Users about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Instapage’s property, its Users and the Instapage Platform. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that User about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.

##### **3.3 Service Providers.**

Instapage uses a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the Instapage Platform and the Payment Services. Service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”). In particular, our service providers are based in Europe, India, Asia Pacific and North and South America.

For example, service providers may help us: (i) fraud prevention, and risk assessment, (ii) perform product development, maintenance and debugging, (iii) allow the provision of the Instapage Services through third party platforms and software tools (e.g. through the integration with our APIs), or (iv) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and to use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Instapage will need to share your information, including personal information, in order to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you.

##### **3.4 Corporate Affiliates.**

To enable or support us in providing the Instapage Platform, we may share your information, including personal information, within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control.

  * **Sharing with Instapage, Inc.** Even if your Country of Residence is not the United States, your information may be shared with Instapage, Inc. which provides the technical infrastructure for the Instapage Platform, product development and maintenance, customer support, trust and safety and other business operation services to other Instapage entities. The data sharing is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and is based on our legitimate interests in providing the Instapage Platform globally.



Additionally, we share your information, including personal information, with our corporate affiliates in order to support and integrate, promote, and to improve the Instapage Platform and our affiliates’ services.   

##### **3.5 Social Media Platforms.**

Where permissible according to applicable law we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as your email address, to hash it and to share it with social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote our products and services or the Instapage Platform. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products or services that may be if your interest.

The social media platforms with which we may share your personal data are not controlled or supervised by Instapage. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such provider.

##### **3.6 Business Transfers.**

If Instapage undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

##### **3.7 Aggregated Data.**

We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other anonymized information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.

##### **4.1 Analyzing your Communications.**

We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Instapage Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.

These activities are carried out based on Instapage’s legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and our Terms of Service, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.

##### **4.2 Linking Third Party Accounts.**

You may link your Instapage Account with your account at a third party social networking service. When you create this link:

  * the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes; and
  * the publication and display of information that you provide to Instapage through this linkage is subject to your settings and authorizations on the Instapage Platform and the third party site.



We only collect your information from linked third party accounts to the extent necessary to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you, or to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, or with your consent.

Instapage doesn’t own or control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Instapage, or both. These Third Party Partners will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites you visit.

You may exercise any of the rights described in this section by sending an email to dpo@Instapage.com. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.

##### **6.2 Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.**

You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your Instapage Account).

##### **6.3 Data Access and Portability.**

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).

##### **6.4 Data Retention and Erasure.**

We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the Instapage Platform to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your Instapage Account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:

  * We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Instapage Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Instapage Account to prevent that User from opening a new Instapage Account in the future.
  * We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Instapage may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
  * Information you have shared with others (e.g., forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Instapage Platform, even after your Instapage Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
  * Because we maintain the Instapage Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.



##### **6.5 Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.**

Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Instapage you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to [dpo@instapage.com](mailto:dpo@instapage.com) specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Instapage override your own.

##### **6.6 Objection to Processing.**

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Instapage and Instapage Payments not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing Instapage and/or Instapage Payments will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask Instapage to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by opting out from your account settings.

##### **6.7 Lodging Complaints.**

You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by Instapage before the competent data protection authorities.

To facilitate our global operations Instapage may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies or with service providers based in Europe, India, Asia Pacific and North and South America. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your Country of Residence. For example, information collected within the EEA may be transferred, stored, and processed outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection. For more information, please see our Information Security Policy by sending a request to dpo@instapage.com or at [instapage.com/security](https://instapage.com/security).

##### **7.1 Other Means to Ensure an Adequate Level of Data Protection.**

If your information is shared with corporate affiliates or third party service providers outside the EEA, we have – prior to sharing your information with such corporate affiliate or third party service provider – established the necessary means to ensure an adequate level of data protection. This may be an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective non-EEA country or an agreement on the basis of the EU Model Clauses (a set of clauses issued by the European Commission). For more information, please see our Information Security Policy by sending a request to dpo@instapage.com or at [instapage.com/security](https://instapage.com/security).

##### **7.2 California & Vermont Residents.**

Instapage Payments will not share information it collects about you with its affiliates or third parties (both financial and non-financial), except as required or permitted by your state’s law.

##### **7.3 California Privacy Rights.**

California law permits Users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. See the “Contact” section for where to send such requests. Instapage and Instapage Payments do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent.

We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use to protect your information are firewalls and data encryption, and information access controls. If you know or have reason to believe that your Instapage Account credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Instapage Account, please contact us following the instructions in the Contact Us section below.

Instapage reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Instapage Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you may cancel your Account. If you do not cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access to or use of the Instapage Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or Instapage’s information handling practices, you may [email ](mailto:help@instapage.com)us at help@instapage.com or contact us at:
