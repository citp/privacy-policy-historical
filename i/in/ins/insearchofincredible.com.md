## How WE Use Cookies and Web Beacons

OUR web site may use "cookies", which are text files placed on YOUR computer, to enable YOU to sign in to OUR services and to help personalize YOUR online experience. WE use cookies to store YOUR preferences and other information on YOUR computer in order to save YOUR time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information, and to display YOUR personalized content and appropriate advertising on YOUR later visits to these web sites.

WE may also use so called "Web beacons" or similar technologies on some ASUS web sites to better tailor those sites to YOUR needs. When a visitor accesses those pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by US or by OUR suppliers. For this purpose information may be transferred to OUR suppliers which is anonymous but may contain the IP address YOU used when accessing OUR web site. OUR suppliers will not associate IP addresses with any other information they may hold. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If YOU don't want YOUR cookie information to be associated with YOUR visits to these pages, YOU can set YOUR browser to reject cookies. If YOU do so, Web beacons and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages; however, those visits will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies. WE may also include Web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or OUR newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.

YOU may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on YOUR browser, however please note that if YOU do this YOU may not be able to use the full functionality of this web site. 

WE do not allow third parties to place their own cookies or Web beacons on OUR site or in OUR advertisements unless they are providing services to US and acting on OUR behalf.

## Security

WE take precautions to protect YOUR personal information against unauthorized access or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. These include internal reviews of OUR data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where WE store YOUR personal information. Transmission of data between different locations of ASUS affiliated companies is performed through OUR encrypted wide area network. When YOU submit personal information via the web site, YOUR information is protected both online and offline. For credit card transactions, WE establish security by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. This means that the credit card information YOU send is encrypted by YOUR computer, and then decrypted again on OUR side, preventing third parties from intercepting the credit card information.

However, ASUS cannot guarantee a perfect security on the Internet. As general best practice when using the internet, WE recommended that YOU use alphanumerical usernames and passwords and to change YOU passwords on a regular basis, as well as keeping YOUR computer up to date by applying the latest available security updates for YOUR software and using such tools as virus/spyware scanners.
