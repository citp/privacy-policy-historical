		      <br>
		    Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) strives to offer its visitors the many advantages   of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized   experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail   address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy   policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any   unauthorized third party. Period."<br>
		    <br>
		    <u><strong>How we gather information from   users:</strong></u><br>
		    <br>
		    How we collect and store information depends on the page   you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the   services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you   register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features,   such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information   when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms,   and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) also collects information   automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to   our visitors. </p>
		  <p align="left">For example, we may log   the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize   you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may   store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that   information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you   encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt   additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In   certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by   setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be   unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your   user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features   according to your preferences.<br>
		      <br>
		    <u><strong>What we do with the information we   collect:</strong></u><br>
		    <br>
		    Like other Web publishers, we collect information to   enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We   respect your privacy and do not share your information with   anyone.<br>
		    <br>
		    Aggregated Information (information that does not personally   identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information   about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to   help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most   or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally   be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information   does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow   anyone to identify you individually.<br>
		    <br>
		    We may use Personally Identifiable   Information collected on Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) to communicate with you about your registration   and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services   and products offered by Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com)   and other topics we think you might find of interest. <br>
		    <br>
		    Personally   Identifiable Information collected by Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) may also be used for other purposes, including but   not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce   transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other   communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for   the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such   information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. </p>
		  <p align="left">In addition, from time   to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or   partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user   information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your   information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are   reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of   amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we   deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice   prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
		      <br>
		    <u><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites   and advertisements:</strong></u><br>
		    <br>
		    Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates   to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,   including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers   accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection   policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link   to, or view as part of a frame on a Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) page, certain content that is actually created or   hosted by a third party. </p>
		  <p align="left">Also, through Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) you may be introduced to, or   be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes   offered by other parties. Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) is not responsible for the actions or policies of   such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those   third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a   third party.<br>
		      <br>
		    While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or   other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify   some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of   our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable   the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement   before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by   third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.   Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) does not control the   use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not   responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
		    <br>
		    You should   also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable   Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed   publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge   and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.   Such activities are beyond the control of Instant Money Code (InstantMoneyCode.com) and this   policy.<br>
