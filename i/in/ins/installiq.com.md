We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We also may share this aggregated data periodically with current and potential Partners.

_Third Parties and Advertising_. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website <http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp>. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.

When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Site, you will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.

_Surveys_. From time-to-time we conduct surveys. If you participate we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participating in surveys is completely voluntary. We use survey information to improve our Sites. We use any personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of contacting you to follow-up on your survey responses. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provided in a survey with any third-party unless we have your consent. On occasion we may hire a third-party to conduct a survey. If we hire a third-party service provider it will be prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose not enumerated in this section.

**_How We Share Your Information._**  
Partners may sponsor Offers or we may co-sponsor an Offer with a Partner through the software. You should always assume data collected when you fill-in an Offer will be shared with a Partner. If an Offer requires you to leave our websites, you should know that our Partners may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We do not control these Partner sites. This Privacy Policy does not cover our partners’ websites and information practices. Once you have voluntarily submitted information to our Partners, your personal information is subject to their privacy policy. We have no liability or responsibility for these privacy policies or the use of any Personally Identifiable Information transferred to Partners.

If you no longer wish to be contacted by our partners you must contact that partner directly to opt-out.

Our Partners change from time to time, and therefore it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list. We strive to select trustworthy Partners who offer high quality products or services of interest to you. If you are unhappy with one of our Partners, tell us by e-mailing us at [privacy@support.w3i.com](mailto:privacy@support.w3i.com), or you can write to Attn: Customer Care, W3i, LLC, 1900 Medical Arts Ave. S. Ste. 200, Sartell, MN 56377.

We may periodically use third parties to meet your needs. For example we might use a credit card processing company to bill you. If we will use a third-party we will notify you at sign-up. If we hire a third-party service provider, they will be prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose not enumerated in this section.

The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:

_Search Partners_. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.

_Third-Party Advertisements and Software_. When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we transfer your information for each request made to that Partner. Once we transfer your Personally Identifiable Information, such information becomes subject to the Partners’ privacy policy.

_Our Products_. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during the installation process of our Toolbars. However, when you use these Software Offers to access Download Offers (e.g. screensavers) you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information. In addition, we will show you Offers during the installation process.

_Other Limited Circumstances_. From time to time, we may validate the information in our database by employing a validation service. In those instances, we will disclose your information pursuant to confidentiality agreements. In addition, we disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) when we market to current and prospective Partners and for other lawful purposes.

_Legal Disclosure_. We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose account information, as required by law, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial procedure served on our sites; or if the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service and improve our Products and Services.

_E-Mail Suppression Lists_. We may disclose a user’s e-mail address as part of a suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its partners and affiliates to make sure that a user’s unsubscribe requests are forwarded to the appropriate parties to ensure removal of the user from partner and affiliate databases in compliance with law, including without limitation, the Can-Spam Act of 2003.

_Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer_. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred assets.

From time to time we use third-parties when providing Services to you. We will only share information with third-parties necessary for them to provide the Services you have requested. Third-parties are prohibited from using your pPersonally Identifiable Information for promotional purposes.
