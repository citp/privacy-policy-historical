InsideHoops.com Privacy Policy 

The InsideHoops Privacy Policy 

InsideHoops is committed to protecting your privacy. InsideHoops currently collects no personal information about who visits our site. InsideHoops uses a hit service that shows information such as which internet service visitors are using, their screen resolutions, browser types, etc. but in no way does this reveal the name, email address, or any specific information whatsoever about the site's visitors. 

Demographic data: 

We can see hostnames of our visitors. In other words, if you are in new york and you use earthlink, we may see that this person visited our site: 833.235.new-york.earthlink.net - but in no way does that tell us who you are. Other information we may see includes what we stated above - screen resolution, browser type, domains, countries, etc., but we repeat - in no way does this identify any sort of personal information about you. We do not know who you are unless you tell us. 

Will InsideHoops disclose the information it collects to outside parties? 

InsideHoops may eventually disclose the aforementioned GENERAL information about visitors - information that does NOT identify who you are. We may disclose answers to questions such as: During what time periods do we receive the most visitors, what is the most common browser version of our visitors, what are the most popular internet services our visitors use, etc. InsideHoops does have an email service, powered by everyone.net (to see everyone.net's privacy statement, visit their site at www.everyone.net ), but InsideHoops will NEVER - I repeat - NEVER share names or email addresses with anyone. The last thing we want is "spam" reaching our visitors. 

About Our Advertisers: 

InsideHoops works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how BurstMedia and everyone.net manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to burstmedia.com and everyone.net 

Your consent: 

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by InsideHoops. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. But, now and forever we put your privacy first before any other concerns. We will never sell lists of email addresses from this site. We respect the privacy of our visitors.
