    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>When visiting the Site or using the Service, we use session "cookies" – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable Insightly to process your online transactions.

Insightly uses persistent cookies that only Insightly can read and use, to identify a user as a Insightly customer and make it easier for you to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service. The use of cookies by our partners and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

    <h2>Analytics / Log Files</h2>
    <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p>

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information. </p>

    <p>Except as described in this policy, Insightly will not give, sell, rent, or loan any personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Insightly maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number, on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure due to the nature of the distributed network that is the Internet.</p>
