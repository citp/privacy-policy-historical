<p>When You register for Insightly You can be certain that we have implemented comprehensive security practices to ensure that only You and those people You provide authorized access to can see your Insightly site. We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for You to know how we handle the information we receive from You via our website at www.insight.ly (the “Site”) and through our on-demand business productivity software, our support platform, and tools and services offered on the Site (the “Service”).</p>
<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
<p>When You register for the Service with Google, we receive information such as your name, e-mail address and Google Apps domain information. <!--If You sign up for the 30-day free trial account, You are not required to enter your credit card information until You decide to continue with a paid plan. Insightly uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Insighly’s behalf.--></p>
<p>You can modify your account information at anytime by clicking on the Settings icon in the global navigation bar at the top right of the screen. Insightly’s practice is not to use such personal information for marketing purposes unless explicitly authorised. Insightly may use the collected personal information and other information Insightly collects about your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to You, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact You about your use of the Service, research purposes and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Site.</p>
<p>Insightly may also transmit or share your personal information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service, which may require that your personal information be transferred from Your current location to the offices and servers of Insightly and the authorized third parties referred to here. Although Insightly owns the software, code, databases, all rights to the Insightly application, You retain all rights to your data.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>When You visit the Site or use the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while You are logged in and to enable Insightly to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. Insightly uses persistent cookies that only Insightly can read and use, to identify You as a Insightly customer and make it easier for You to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.</p>
<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
<p>Except as described in this policy, Insightly will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Insightly may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>
