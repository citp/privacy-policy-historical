‘cookies’ are parcels of text sent by a server to web client (browser) and then sent back unchanged by the client each time it accesses that server. Cookies are simple pieces of data unable to perform any operation by themselves – they are neither spyware nor viruses. Cookies are used for authenticating, session tracking and maintaining specific information about users such as site preferences or the contents of ‘shopping carts’. 

**1\. Type of Information We Collect**

Like most websites we use Google Analytics to track user interaction. We use this data to assess your use of the website, such as where you arrived from, what page you arrived on, which pages you visit and how long you stay for. 

Although Google Analytics records data such as your device, internet browser, geographical location and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. Google Analytics also records your computer’s IP address. Your IP address is a string of numbers unique to your computer that is recorded by our web server when you request any page or component on the Website. This information is used to monitor your usage of the Website. 

We also use Clicky.com, which provides us with the same type of information, none of which personally identifies you to us. 

We consider Google and Clicky.com to be a third-party data processors and they are compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR). We process this data under legitimate interest. 

**2\. Cookies & 3rd Party Advertisements **

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on the Website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Website users based on their visit to the Website and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. 

We allow third-party companies to serve ads, including ads based on online behavioural advertising (OAB) and behavioural retargeting practices, and/or to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide targeted advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you, based on your browsing patterns and Website interactions. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. 

To learn more about this online behavioural advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit youronlinechoices.com, networkadvertising.org or http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. When you opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising, it does not mean that you do not receive advertising when visiting the Website; instead, the advertising you see will no longer be customised. All third-party companies we work with to serve ads on the Website are GDPR compliant. The basis for processing this data is consent. 

**3\. Use of Plug-ins**

Some of the Website’s pages use plug-ins provided by other organisations, e.g. the ‘Facebook Like’ or ‘Tweet’ button. These organisations may use information about your visit to our Website on their pages. 

**4\. Your Rights**

You have the right to request a copy of any information that we currently hold about you. In order to receive such information, please send your contact details including postal address and payment of £10 to cover administration expenses to contact@insidefutbol.com. You can also request to receive this information via email for no charge. 

**5\. Data Breaches**

We will report any data breaches of the Website’s database or the database(s) of any of our third party data processors to any and all relevant persons and authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach if we have reason to believe that personal data stored in an identifiable manner has been stolen. 

**6\. Other Websites**

This privacy policy only covers the Website. Any other websites which may be linked to by our website are subject to their own policy, which may differ from ours. 

**7\. Consent**

If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page and may place notices on other pages of the Website, so that you may be aware of the information that we collect and how we use it at all times. Continued use of the services provided by the Website will signify that you agree to any such changes.
