These reports provide information that may assist in determining your eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged.  Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewals or extensions of this insurance.  The insurance company may also obtain and use a credit-based insurance score based on information contained in your credit report.  The insurance company may use a third party in connection with the development of the insurance score.</p>

We may share this information with our insurance partners to bring similar information to your attention. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. Please contact us to request that your name and address should be removed from our lists. <strong> If you do not want to receive e-mails from us, please submit a request to have your e-mail address unsubscribed by <a href="http://wcs.noruidpro.com/unsub/unsub.form?id=79e9825384dbc00b4c10e4948772a86e"> clicking here </a>.</strong></p><strong> </strong>

<h2>Our Security Measures</h2>
<p>Our web sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of the information under our control.</p>
<h2>Why We Use "Cookies" </h2>
<p>When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information. A "cookie" is a small piece of program code that resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our "Request Information" sites. Each time you visit our site, the cookie uses the stored information to pre-populate our online forms, so that you do not have to re-enter your contact information as you move from one site to another.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Data created by a web server that is stored on a user's computer. A cookie provides a way for the web site to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk.</p>
<p>The cookies contain a range of URLs (web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID is stored as a cookie, it saves that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session.</p>
<p>You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.</p>
<h3>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</h3>
<p>This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.</p>
<h3>Browser Session</h3>
<p>A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you re-open the browser, you begin a new session.</p>
<h3>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</h3>
<p>The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session. InsureMyCar4Less also uses SSL encryption whenever we display your personal information (e.g. name and address).</p>
<h3>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h3>
<p>An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for InsureMyCar4Less is www.InsureMyCar4Less.com.
