<strong>Insidemex.com Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
We at Insidemex.com,
Inc. want you to feel safe online. For that reason, we follow a privacy policy
that applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Editorial
Kilimanjaro, SA de CV, Insidemex.com's parent company.&nbsp; In line with that policy, we want to
let you know how we treat personal information that we collect and receive from
visitors to and registered users of the website <a href="http://www.insidemex.com/">www.insidemex.com</a> . Personal information is
information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address,
email address or phone number.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy
covers the following:
</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
	<li> The information we collect and use, including
	how we generally use that information.</li>
	<li> What we share and disclose and why and to whom.</li>
	<li> What " Cookies" and "Web beacons" are and how
	we use them.</li>
	<li> How to update and delete your account

</ul>
<p>
Insidemex.com' Privacy
Policy applies only to websites and services that are owned and operated by Editorial
Kilimanjaro, SA de CV. While other websites may be displayed as search results
or links from within Insidemex.com, those sites are owned and operated by
others, and they may have different privacy policies. When linking from Insidemex.com
to other websites, if you have privacy concerns, we urge you to review the
privacy policies of those sites.
</p>
<p>
It's also important to
note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you post,
yourself, in public areas of the Insidemex.com website. For example, if you
choose to let other people see your name, photo and email address on your
Profile page, or if you post information or comments on a discussion board,
that information will be made public. Your messages and other information you
make available in public areas of the Insidemex.com website will be seen by
people and organizations not related to or controlled by Insidemex.com, and may
be used by others to contact you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
</p>
<p>
We collect personal
information from you whenever you interact with Insidemex.com, such as when
you:
</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
	<li> Register with Insidemex.com,</li>
	<li> Use our products or services,</li>
	<li> Enter promotions or sweepstakes, and</li>
	<li> Visit web pages on Insidemex.com or on the
	websites of certain of our partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may combine
information about you that we have with information we obtain from business
partners or other companies.
</p>
<p>
When you register, we ask for
information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender and ZIP code.
Once you register with Insidemex.com and sign in to our services, you are not
anonymous to us. You are free to use Insidemex.com without registering or
setting up a personal Insidemex.com Account; however, some of our services and
web pages are available only to those who are registered members.
</p>
<p>
We automatically
receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including
your IP address, Insidemex.com cookie information and the pages you request.
</p>
<p>
We use your personal information for the
following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see,
fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact
you, conduct research and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external
clients. In short, the information you provide us can help us to understand how
to make the website more convenient and useful to you.
</p>
<p>
In we provide access to your personal
information only to Insidemex.com employees and contractors who we believe need
that access in order to do their jobs and to provide products or services to
you. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>
We do not rent, sell
or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated
companies except to provide products or services you request, when we have your
permission or under the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
	<li> We may sometimes share aggregate non-personal
	information with third parties such as the media, advertisers and government
	agencies. This aggregate information is typically in the form of statistics,
	such as numbers of Insidemex.com members who live in a particular state or fall
	within a particular age group. Such aggregate information is gathered from individual
	Insidemex.com members' information but is not traceable to any specific
	identifiable Insidemex.com member.</li>
	<li> We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal
	process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
	claims.</li>
	<li> We believe it is necessary to share information
	in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities,
	suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
	of any person, violations of the Insidemex.com terms of use or as otherwise
	required or permitted by law.</li>
	<li> If Insidemex.com is acquired by or merged with
	or into another company, we will provide notice before personal information is
	transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Our Advertisers</strong>
</p>
<p>
We do not share your
personal information with our advertisers, unless you have explicitly, in
writing, requested us to do so. However, the advertising we display is targeted
to users of particular services and content. So if you view or click on a
targeted ad, the advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser)
may assume that you meet the targeting criteria, for example, women ages 50-60
from a particular geographic area or with children or grandchildren of a
certain age.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
</p>
<p>
Insidemex.com, like
many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie
is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer's hard
drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use
your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, AOL or Mozilla Firefox) to connect
to Insidemex.com, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Insidemex.com
to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a
generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and
information that relates to where you live (your ZIP code) and products or
services that reflect your interests.
</p>
<p>
In addition to Insidemex.com's
cookies, when you visit Insidemex.com your computer may receive cookies from
our advertisers and from other sites displayed as search results or links. The
cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by Insidemex.com'
Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those advertisers and outside websites.
</p>
<p>
You can set up your
browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However,
cookies allow you to take full advantage of Insidemex.com' interactive
features, and we hope you will leave them turned on.
</p>
<p>
Insidemex.com also
uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access Insidemex.com
cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Insidemex.com
products and services. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page
that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess
the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Insidemex.com
website. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Insidemex.com
members, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal
information is transmitted through web beacons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-party Ad Serving</strong>
</p>
<p>
Insidemex.com
contracts with third party companies to help us make sure that our content and
advertising are relevant and effective, and to analyze how visitors use our
site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing
company on this site. The type of information we collect includes, for example,
the pages you visited at Insidemex.com. This information helps us learn things
like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which products are most
interesting and what kinds of offers our visitors like to see. Although our
third party marketing partners manage the information coming from our site on
our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not
want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing
strategy, you can "opt-out" of allowing us to analyze such data by sending an
email to <a href="mailto:support@insidemex.com">support@insidemex.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The ads on Insidemex.com
pages are delivered to you by OpenX, our web advertising partner. Information
about your visit to Insidemex.com, such as number of times you have viewed an
ad, is used to serve ads to you whenever you visit Insidemex.com. For more
information about OpenX, cookies and how to opt out, please click here <a href="http://www.openx.org/privacy/market">http://www.openx.org/privacy/market</a>
</p>
<p>
Insidemex.com may utilize
third party advertising companies to serve a portion of the ads on the site.
These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your
visit to our site in order to provide relevant offers. You can find out more
information about this practice and your choices concerning this practice at

</p>
<p>
We reserve the right
to send you certain important communications relating to the Insidemex.com
service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, throughout
the term of your personal Insidemex.com account, without offering you the
opportunity to opt-out of receiving these important communications.
