# InstantService - Privacy Policy

**InstantService™ Inc.**  
InstantService Inc. has a firm commitment to privacy. The following describes the information gathering and disclosure practices of InstantService. 

**Disclosure of Information**  
InstantService will never make your email or mail address available to any other company without your permission. 

Information We Gather and How It's Used  **Your Information - Automatically Logged**  
We may use your email and IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site and to help identify you when you use the InstantService service to contact us. Your email and IP addresses are also used to gather broad demographic information. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of data your web browser stores on your hard drive. We use cookies so we can recognize you when you pay a repeat visit to our website.

**Registration Forms**  
Our site's registration form requests users to give us contact information which includes, but is not limited to, contact name(s), email address(es) and phone numbers.

Contact information from the registration form is used to provide information about your company and may be used to send out promotional material about our services and our partners. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary due to changes in services or to respond to a request for support from our Services Organization.

You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

**Financial Information**  
When you decide to purchase our product, in addition to the information we requested for registration, we ask for Company name and address (if applicable), billing address, and payment method (invoice, credit card, etc.). This information is used to process your order. All information we gather is stored in a secure database.

**Surveys**  
Periodically we may request our visitors to complete (at their discretion) online surveys that will provide InstantService with contact information (like e-mail addresses, name and address of your company, your position), unique identifiers (like account numbers), and company demographic information (like zip code, primary business and financial status).

Contact information from the surveys is used to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. This information is also used to get in touch with visitors if additional information is requested or if the visitor left the Web site without completing the entire survey form.

**Security**  
The InstantService sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control including the text of any communications that may be logged and stored. InstantService has installed and maintains secure servers protected by a firewall to provide for the security of all data provided to us by our visitors and protects the confidentiality of all logged and stored communication data.
