We retain the Personal Data processed by us for as long as is considered necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Considering the data retention period for which Personal Data can be held, depends on the purposes for which the information was collected, the data retention period can vary in each situation.

## V. What measures do we take to secure your Personal Data

InSites takes the security of the Personal Data we process seriously. Therefore we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure the processing of Personal Data. These safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity, format, location, amount, distribution and storage of the Personal Data, and include measures designed to keep Personal Data protected from unauthorized access. If appropriate, the safeguards include the encryption of communications via for example SSL, encryption of information during storage, firewalls, access controls, separation of duties, and similar security protocols. We restrict access to Personal Data to our staff members and third parties that require access to such information for legitimate and relevant business purposes.

All our staff members, contractors and third parties who will have access to your Personal Data on InSites’ instructions will be bound to confidentiality and we use access controls to limit access to individuals that require such access for the performance of their responsibilities and tasks.

## VI. Transfers of Personal Data

We will only share your Personal Data with others when we are legally permitted to do so and where it’s necessary to fulfil the purposes related to those described above.

When we share Personal Data with others, we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place to protect the Personal Data and to comply with our own data protection, confidentiality and security standards.

We are part of a global network of corporations and can make use of third party service provides in other countries to help us run our business. As a result, the Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). This includes countries that do not have laws that provide specific protection on the processing of Personal Data. Some of those countries however have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections as EEA data protection laws. Under certain conditions the GDPR allows InSites to transfer Personal Data to such countries.

In any case, we have taken steps to ensure all Personal Data is processed respecting adequate levels oof security and that all transfers of the Personal Data outside the EEA take place in accordance with applicable data protection legislation and that there will be an appropriate level of protection. We will implement legal safeguards governing such transfer, such as model contractual clauses, individuals’ consent, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.

Personal Data we hold may be transferred:

  * **to our subsidiaries and affiliates**  
We may share your Personal Data within our global network of corporations when this is necessary for providing or improving our products and services or when this is necessary for the purpose for which your Personal Data was collected. For details of our subsidiaries and affiliates, please [click here](https://www.insites-consulting.com/about-us/offices/).
  * **to our Service Providers**  
We use third parties to support us in providing our services and to help provide, run and manage our internal IT systems or (internal) business processes.  
For example, providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service provider, Website hosting and management, data analysis, recruiting software, data back-up, security and storage services.
  * **law enforcement or other government and regulatory agencies or to other third parties as required by, and in accordance with, applicable law or regulation:**  
We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent information to law enforcement or other third parties with the authority to acquire Personal Data, such as to check that we are complying with applicable law and regulation, to investigate an alleged crime, to establish, exercise or defend legal rights. We will only fulfil requests for Personal Data where this is necessary and appropriate and where we are permitted to do so in accordance with applicable law or regulation.
