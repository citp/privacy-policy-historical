None of the information identifies you personally and we do not link aggregate information to Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p><u>Cookies</u>.  A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser. Cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. We and our Partners use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie will terminate. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.</p>

<p>We use cookies to: 1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers). We also use cookies to store your zip code and other information you have submitted for other services, such as displaying your local weather; 2) Record your Blog URL and Username on your local computer to allow us to remember you on your next visit; 3) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing our Services is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by registered users and unregistered users, and to help target advertisements based on user interests; 4) Allows our Partners to track visits to their sites and stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen; 5) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example which of our Sites you have visited. We use this information to understand our users' habits so that we can make each new experience on a Site a better one. We may also use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you will see. We do not store Personally Identifiable Information in our cookies and we do not tie the information in our cookies to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information</p>

<p>Some of the Partner Offers on our Services may also use affiliate cookies after you click on their offer in order to track the offer. We have no control over our partners’ privacy policies. We also have no control over their cookies, the information collected and its use.</p>

<p><u>Web beacons or Pixels</u>. We and our Partners employ a software technology that helps us better manage content on our site.

They are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixels to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p>Some of the Partner Offers may also use Pixels. We have no control over our partners’ Pixels. We also have no control over how they use information collected.</p>

<p>We  use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and  what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo! may also use anonymous  information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve  its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services  of interest to you.

We may create a GUID when you install our Products or Services. We use GUIDs to track installations and to enable features and functionality for specific customers who subscribe to our Products and Services. We do not tie the information gathered by GUIDs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p><u>Software Information</u>.  We employ a technology that allows us to determine the operating systems you are using and to view your computer’s registry. Software installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry, we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible versions of DirectX, and Flash Player installed. We use your registry information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with software already present on your PC. We do not tie registry information gathered to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p><u>Hardware Information</u>. Your computer’s operating system also stores hardware information that we examine to determine your computer’s hardware configuration including the amount of memory and the type of video card your computer has, as well as the speed of your processor.

We do not tie hardware information to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p><u>E-mail Offers</u>. By providing your e-mail address, and choosing to receive our Offers, you agree to receive e-mails from us.  Should you have any questions or concerns, or if you would like to discontinue receiving Offers, simply email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.w3i.com">privacy@support.w3i.com</a> and ask us to remove you from our lists. You will only receive Offers via e-mail from us and our Partners if you have indicated that you would like to receive them.</p>

<p><u>Newsletters</u>. If you subscribe to our newsletter, we use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  If you not longer want to receive our newsletter follow the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of the newsletter or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.w3i.com">privacy@support.w3i.com</a>.</p>

If you no longer want to receive these types of notifications email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.w3i.com">privacy@support.w3i.com</a>.  If you use the blog or comment features on our Sites you should also be aware that any information including Personally Identifiable Information you submit can be read, collected, and used by other users and could be used to send unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for Personally Identifiable Information you choose to submit using Site blog or comment features.</p>

<p><u>Widgets</u>. We use the “Share and Enjoy” and “Add This” widgets to enable you to share blog posts from our sites or to post links to our sites on third party sites or within emails.  If you choose to send an email, or share a blog post from our Sites, no third party personal information is collected.</p>

<p>If you use the email a friend feature your friend’s email will be collected for the sole purpose of sending them a onetime email to visit the site.  Please note that any personal information you submit within these widgets is not governed by this privacy policy.</p>

<p><u>Research</u>. We study users' demographics and interests using your information. We also use cookies, pixels, software checker information and server log files to better understand and serve you. We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We also may share this aggregated data periodically with current and potential Partners.</p>

<p><u>Third Parties and Advertising</u>. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.  Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.</p>

<p>When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Site, you will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.</p>

<p><u>Surveys</u>. From time-to-time we conduct surveys.  If you participate we may request certain personally identifiable information from you.  Participating in surveys is completely voluntary.  We use survey information to improve our Sites.  We use any personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of contacting you to follow-up on your survey responses.  We will not share the personally identifiable information you provided in a survey with any third-party unless we have your consent.  On occasion we may hire a third-party to conduct a survey.  If we hire a third-party service provider it will be prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose not enumerated in this section.</p>

<p><b><u>How We Share Your Information.</u></b><br>
Partners may sponsor Offers or we may co-sponsor an Offer with a Partner through the software. You should always assume data collected when you fill-in an Offer will be shared with a Partner. If an Offer requires you to leave our websites, you should know that our Partners may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We do not control these Partner sites. This Privacy Policy does not cover our partners’ websites and information practices. Once you have voluntarily submitted information to our Partners, your personal information is subject to their privacy policy. We have no liability or responsibility for these privacy policies or the use of any Personally Identifiable Information transferred to Partners.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish to be contacted by our partners you must contact that partner directly to opt-out.</p>

<p>Our Partners change from time to time, and therefore it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list. We strive to select trustworthy Partners who offer high quality products or services of interest to you. If you are unhappy with one of our Partners, tell us by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.w3i.com">privacy@support.w3i.com</a>, or you can write to Attn: Customer Care, W3i, LLC, 1900 Medical Arts Ave. S. Ste. 200, Sartell, MN 56377.</p>

<p>We may periodically use third parties to meet your needs.  For example we might use a credit card processing company to bill you.  If we will use a third-party we will notify you at sign-up.  If we hire a third-party service provider, they will be prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose not enumerated in this section.</p>

<p>The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:</p>

<p><u>Search Partners</u>. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.</p>

<p><u>Third-Party Advertisements and Software</u>.  When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we transfer your information for each request made to that Partner. Once we transfer your Personally Identifiable Information, such information becomes subject to the Partners’ privacy policy.</p>

<p><u>Our Products</u>. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during the installation process of our Toolbars. However, when you use these Software Offers to access Download Offers (e.g. screensavers) you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information. In addition, we will show you Offers during the installation process.</p>

<p><u>Other Limited Circumstances</u>. From time to time, we may validate the information in our database by employing a validation service. In those instances, we will disclose your information pursuant to confidentiality agreements. In addition, we disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) when we market to current and prospective Partners and for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p><u>Legal Disclosure</u>. We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose account information, as required by law, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial procedure served on our sites; or if the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service and improve our Products and Services.</p>

<p><u>E-Mail Suppression Lists</u>. We may disclose a user’s e-mail address as part of a suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its partners and affiliates to make sure that a user’s unsubscribe requests are forwarded to the appropriate parties to ensure removal of the user from partner and affiliate databases in compliance with law, including without limitation, the Can-Spam Act of 2003.</p>

<p><u>Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer</u>. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred assets.</p>

<p><a name="YourChoices" class="anchor"></a>From time to time we use third-parties when providing Services to you.  We will only share information with third-parties necessary for them to provide the Services you have requested.  Third-parties are prohibited from using your pPersonally Identifiable Information for promotional purposes.</p>

In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our Partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail or direct postal mail about other products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or postal mail from us, you can tell us by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@support.w3i.com">privacy@support.w3i.com</a>.
