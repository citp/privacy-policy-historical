What Information is Collected.

Personally Identifiable Information: You may be required to register or otherwise voluntarily provide personally identifiable information to have access to some features of the Site. You always may choose not to provide the personally identifiable information, but this may lead to decreased functionality of the Site for you and our inability to provide you with certain products or services.
