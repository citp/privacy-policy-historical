**Our Advertisers**

We do not share your personal information with our advertisers, unless you have explicitly, in writing, requested us to do so. However, the advertising we display is targeted to users of particular services and content. So if you view or click on a targeted ad, the advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser) may assume that you meet the targeting criteria, for example, women ages 50-60 from a particular geographic area or with children or grandchildren of a certain age. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

Insidemex.com, like many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer's hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, AOL or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Insidemex.com, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Insidemex.com to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your ZIP code) and products or services that reflect your interests. 

In addition to Insidemex.com's cookies, when you visit Insidemex.com your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers and from other sites displayed as search results or links.

Insidemex.com also uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access Insidemex.com cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Insidemex.com products and services. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Insidemex.com website. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Insidemex.com members, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.
