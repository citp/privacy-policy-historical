### PRIVACY POLICY

Insomniac Games, Inc., is committed to maximizing your experience on its website within a trusted environment. This privacy policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you online. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in the Insomniac Games website and enhance your experience.

Those activities include things like signing up for an email newsletter or other online information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us.

For example, the submitted email address would then be used to send you, via email, our news updates and to otherwise keep you informed as to what’s going on at Insomniac Games.

Our website contains links through which an online visitor can email us. We collect personal information contained in the email for the purpose of responding to a visitor’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on our website job openings at Insomniac Games and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant.s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy policy.

You will know when personally identifiable information is collected because you will be asked to fill out a form. However, we may collect some information about you by using data collection technology, so that it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected.

An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

(You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.) We do not use IP addresses or cookies to collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, or to link this information to personally identifiable information already collected about you. This information may be used to make our site more interesting and useful to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, or to protect our service, website or visitors to the website.
