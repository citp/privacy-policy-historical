  * Service Providers: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.

### Your Content

While using Instagantt Standalone (without Asana), you can create Gantt Charts, comments, notes, and other content you'd like to post to the service when available, handled and stored in our own infrastructure. This content may be shared by you with other users of the service, like inviting collaborators to a Project or Workbook. We may use third party companies (sub processors) to provide you the service. 

While using Instagantt for Asana, the service allows you to view the content of your Asana Account in the way of a Gantt Chart, and also gives you the ability to create and edit content from it. All your content is ruled by Asana’s Terms of Service, and the service will never access your content without your permission.

### Access to Your Content

You are granting Instagantt to access your content and your Asana content (when you're using Instagantt for Asana) for the following purposes: i) fill the content inside the Instagantt Application, ii) Make modifications whenever you request the Instagantt Application to do so. Instagantt will never access your content without your knowledge for a purpose different than the intended in providing the service. All read/write operations to Asana API or to the Standalone version are triggered by the user, using our web interface or our API.

### Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. We collect and use your information only where: 

  * We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features;
  * You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or 
  * We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.



If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services. 

Also, you're under the following rights:

  * If you wish to request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing hello@instagantt.com.
  * If you wish to object the processing of your personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing hello@instagantt.com.
  * If you wish to request portability of your personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing hello@instagantt.com.
  * Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.



### Children's privacy

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, and children under 13 are prohibited from using the service. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, you can alert us at hello@instagantt.com. 

### Security

We will use industry standard technical and organizational security measures in connection with the storage, processing and transfer of your Content that are designed to protect the integrity of that Content and to guard against unauthorized or unlawful access to, use of, or processing of such Content. Instagantt does not save any information about project tasks when using it in connection with Asana. All the information is fetched and pushed directly from and to the Asana API. If you decide to create a Baseline or a Public Snapshot (shareable), this information will be stored on our own resources. When using Instagantt Standalone, all data created is managed and stored in our own infrastructure, secured by industry level standards.

### Data Retention

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### Personal Data

Instagantt will never sell your personal data for any purpose. We're not on the business of selling personal data to advertisers or any interedted party. 

### Termination

You are free to stop using our Service at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Service at any time at our discretion and without notice. We may also terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time if you are not complying with these Terms or if you are using the Service in a manner that we believe may cause us financial or legal liability.

### Modifications to the Service

The Service may be modified from time to time, often without prior notice to you. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such modifications. If you are not satisfied with a modification we make to the Service, your sole remedy is to terminate your use of the Service.
