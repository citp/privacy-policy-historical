Your personal data is particularly collected and processed, entirely or

collection forms (brochure requests, registration for events, applications for
our training programmes, etc.) and, more generally, in the framework of
your relations and exchanges via the Site and subsequent (online or offline)

Generally, your data is therefore collected directly from you under the
circumstances mentioned below.
In addition to that information, you are informed that the data we collect and
process about you may be enhanced by us via information sources (other
web platforms provided by INSEAD, rental of files, recommendations or
information from third parties, etc.).
Furthermore, more specifically in relation to the information processed in
this respect by our recruitment operations, we use the information you send
us by email to incorporate into our file of applicants (CV library). However,
we may also contact third parties (e.g. recruitment agencies, previous
                                                                                 7

Within the Site, you are informed of the compulsory nature of providing your
personal data on each collection form by the presence of an asterisk
alongside the relevant field(s). Where no asterisk is present, the requested
information is optional.
If the compulsory information is not entered, the request associated with
that collection of personal data (e.g. brochure request, registration for an
event, application for a training programme, etc.) may not be able to be
processed or its processing may be delayed.
In respect of optional information requested, they are generally designed to

ensure that the contents of our Site remain relevant to your interests and
needs.

In the context of a transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation
or sale of assets, we may need to share your personal data with buyers or
sellers.
7     HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
INSEAD has determined precise rules concerning how long we retain your
personal data. This length of time varies depending on the different
purposes and must take into account any legal obligations to retain some of
your data.
The retention time within INSEAD has been defined to allow us to process
your requests (brochures, contacts, registration for an event, job application
or registration for a training programme, etc.), manage and monitor them
and/or      complete     our   prospecting,     canvassing     loyalty-building,
communication and marketing operations, while complying with the principle
of proportionality according to which personal data must not be retained for
longer than necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected.
It is nevertheless specified that all of this data may be retained for longer
than the lengths of time mentioned in this article:
        either with your consent;
        or in the form of archives, to respond to any legal or regulatory
         obligations applicable to INSEAD or for the legal limitation or
         objection periods.
                                                                               9


        or in the form of data reused for the purposes of logs, statistics or
         research.
8    HYPERLINKS TO EXTERNAL SITES
This Site includes links to third-party websites. Those sites are not
managed or updated by INSEAD and are therefore not covered by this
charter. INSEAD does not have any control over the content of those
websites, nor over their confidentiality policies, their use of personal data,
use of cookies, or the way in which they collect, process and store that
data. You are therefore advised to consult the terms and conditions for
collecting and using personal data established by those external sites
before sending them any information.
9    WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND

9.5    Right to restrict processing
You have the right to ask us to restrict your data, i.e. marking your personal
data held by us (e.g. b y temporarily moving your data to another
processing system or locking your data to make it inaccessible), in order to
restrict its future use.
You can exercise this right when:
         the accuracy of the data in question is disputed;
         Your personal data is not processed in accordance with the GDPR
          and French law;
         the data is no longer necessary to fulfil the initial purposes but
          cannot yet be deleted for legal reasons (e.g. official recording, the
          exercise or defence of your rights in legal proceedings);
         a decision concerning your processing objection is pending.
In the case of a restriction on processing, your personal data shall no longer
be subject to any processing without your prior agreement, with the
exception of its retention (storage).
Your personal data may still be processed for the purpose of official
recording, the exercise or defence of your rights in legal proceedings, or to
protect the rights of another natural person or legal entity, or else on
important grounds of public interest in the European Union or Member
State.
In the case of a restriction on processing of some of your personal data, we
will keep you informed of the date when the measure will be lifted.

Also do not forget to indicate the reason for contacting us in the body of
your email.
You can also exercise this right by sending us a letter to the following
address: INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, 77305 Fontainebleau, France.
Your written request must be signed and accompanied by a copy of your
identity document. The request must specify the address to which the
response should be sent. A response will then be sent to you within one
month following receipt of the request, two months in the event of a request
requiring more in-depth research or in the event that INSEAD receives an
excessive number of requests.
9.6     Objection right
You have the right to object to us processing your personal data if, for your
own reasons, you consider that one of the forms of processing infringes
your privacy and causes you excessive harm. You cannot prevent us from
processing your data:
        if its processing is required to conclude or perform your contract.
         For example, your data must be processed to validate your
         registration with INSEAD;
        if its processing is required by law or a regulation. That is
         particularly the case when you move to another address;
        if its processing is required to officially record, exercise or defend
         rights in legal proceedings.
You can object to the use of your personal data for the purposes of
marketing communications and particularly advertising. You can also object
to profiling if it is linked to marketing communications (e.g. when we send
you personalised content).
You simply need to send an email to 5555-itservicedesk@insead.edu with
the subject line “objection right: personal data”, attaching a copy of your
identity document showing your signature.
It is important to include the reasons for your objection request.
You can also exercise this right by sending us a letter to the following
address: INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, 77305 Fontainebleau, France.
Your written request must be signed and accompanied by a photocopy of
your identity document bearing your signature. The request must specify
the address to which the response should be sent.
INSEAD has two months to respond to your objection request. If your
request is imprecise or does not include all the information enabling us to
fulfil your request, we will contact you to ask for further information within
that time.
However, it may be that we are able to accede to your request. In that case,
we will of course provide you with as clear a response as possible.
Furthermore, any emails and newsletters which may be sent to you will
contain a link you can click on to stop receiving promotional information
from us.
Specifically in relation to your right to object to marketing communications,
we remind you that our marketing partners are responsible for their use of
                                                                             14


your personal data and taking into account your rights, including to no
longer receive offers from them.
9.7    Right to digital death
You have the option to send us instructions relating to the retention,
deletion and communication of your personal data after your death. Those
instructions may also be recorded with a “certified digital trusted third party”.
Those instructions, a sort of “digital will”, may appoint a person responsible
for their execution or, failing, that your heirs will be appointed.
In the absence of any instructions, you heirs may contact us to:
        Access the processing of personal data in order to “organise and
         settle the deceased’s estate”;
        Receive communication of the “digital goods” or “personal data
         containing family memories, transferable to the heirs”;
        Close your personal account on the Site and object to the continued
         processing of your personal data.
In any case, you have the option of informing us, at any time, that you do
not want your personal data to be communicated to a third party after your
death.
9.8    Portability right
This right gives you the possibility of more easily managing your personal
data yourself, specifically:
retrieving your personal data processed by us, for your personal use, and
storing it on a device or in a private cloud for example.
transferring your personal data from us to another company, either by you,
or directly by us, subject to that direct transfer being “technically possible”.
That right covers both your actively and knowingly declared data, such as
your data supplied to create your online account (e.g. email address,
username, age) and the information collected by INSEAD.
Conversely, personal data derived, calculated or inferred from data you
have supplied, e.g. the results of a medical examination, is excluded from
the portability right since it has been created by INSEAD.
You simply need to send an email to 5555-itservicedesk@insead.edu
stating your full name and with the subject line “portability right: personal
data”, attaching a copy of your identity document showing your signature.
Do not forget to indicate in your email the files concerned and the type of
request (data retrieval and/or transfer to a new service provider).
You can also exercise this right by sending us a letter to the following
address: INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, 77305 Fontainebleau, France.
Your written request must be signed and accompanied by a photocopy of
your identity document bearing your signature. The request must specify
the address to which the response should be sent. A response will then be
sent to you within one month following receipt of the request, two months in
                                                                                15


the event of a request requiring more in-depth research or in the event that
INSEAD receives an excessive number of requests.
You should be aware, however, that INSEAD is entitled to refuse your
portability request. In fact, this right only applies to personal data based on
your consent or performance of a contract concluded with us (for more
details of personal data covered by the portability right: click on the
Purposes and Grounds section). Similarly, this right may not infringe on
third-party rights and freedoms, whose data may be contained in the data
transmitted following a portability request.
10 IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA SENT ABROAD?
10.1 Data transfer within Europe
Personal data benefits from the same level of protection within the
European Economic Area.
We process your personal data on IT servers located in the EEA.
10.2 Data transfer outside Europe
INSEAD transfers, processes and stores your information on IT servers
located in a number of countries outside Europe as set out in the table
below.
You should be aware that protection of privacy and rules allowing
authorities to access your personal data in those countries are not
necessarily equivalent to those in Europe.
In order to ensure standards are adhered to in terms of data and privacy
protection, we impose technical and legal guarantees on all our partners.
11 DATA SECURITY
INSEAD takes all useful and appropriate physical, logical, technical,
functional, administrative and organisational precautions and measures to
guarantee the security of your personal data, with regard to the state of the
art, implementation costs and the nature, extent, context and purposes of
the processing, as well as the risks, whose degree of likelihood and severity
vary, to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to preserve data
security and confidentiality and guarantee a level of security appropriate to
the risks, and particularly to prevent the data being distorted, damaged or
accessed by unauthorised third parties.
Due to the difficulties inherent in exercising an activity on the internet and
the risks, of which you are aware, resulting from the electronic transmission
of data, INSEAD may not be bound by a performance obligation.
In the event that difficulties occur, INSEAD shall do its utmost to circumvent
the risks and shall take all adequate measures, in accordance with its legal
and regulatory obligations (corrective actions, informing the national
                                                                             16


authority responsible for personal data protection and, where relevant, data
subjects, etc.).
In the event that all or part of the personal data processing is
subcontracted, INSEAD contractually imposes security guarantees on its
subcontractors, particularly in terms of confidentiality in respect of the
personal data to which they may have access (appropriate technical and
organisational measures to protect that data).
