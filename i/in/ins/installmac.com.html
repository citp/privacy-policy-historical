<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We place great emphasis on the security and integrity of your information and the data stored in our systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>InstallMac is provided under the best commercially reasonable data security practices, in order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or deletion of any and all information stored in our systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge, however, that no such effort can completely guarantee the security of the stored data, that breaches of security are still a possibility both regarding our systems and that a data security breach resulting in unauthorized access to your information can occur in third party system (for example, ISP’s and hosting services providers).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, a Breach Notification does NOT constitute an admission by us that the breach occurred as a result of malpractice, failure, bad faith or negligence on our behalf or that the breach even occurred in our systems.</p>
