****Pied Piper Marketing , Inc. (“PPM”) Privacy Policy _(Last updated J uly 12, 2003)_****

PPM has established this Privacy Policy consisting of ten principles, to protect and manage your (the customer’s) personal information.  PPM will occasionally update this Privacy Policy.  When it does, PPM will also revise the “last update” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  For changes to this policy, PPM will notify you by placing a notice on its web site home page.

PPM collects, at time of your registration and your sign-on to its web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally identifies you) such as your name, email address, home or work address, telephone number, and your computer hardware and software (e.g. IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses), a listing of which can be found by clicking here.

PPM has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries and complaints.  The Privacy Policy also provides that PPM will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on PPM’s behalf .

PPM has designated responsibility for your personal information to its [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacy@piedpipermarketingcom), who ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy.  Other PPM individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacy@piedpipermarketing.com).

PPM also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e. not individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational, marketing and other promotional purposes.

If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes.

**3.** | **Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure**  
---|---  
  
Registration for PPM products and services by a customer will constitute the customer’s consent for PPM to collect, use and disclose personal information under this Privacy Policy.  PPM will normally seek a customer’s consent for any new uses and disclosures of the customer’s personal information, either at the same time it collects the personal information or after it has been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose. In certain circumstances however, PPM will not be required to inform and obtain the consent of the customer, such as investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened, or the collection of a debt.

A customer may withdraw such consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time, on prior written notice, provided that PPM may on such withdrawal suspend or terminate its products and services.

**4.** | **Limiting the Collection of Personal Information**  
---|---  
  
PPM limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes.  PPM does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

When you visit the PPM web site, a cookie may be placed on your computer or the cookie may be read if you have visited the PPM site previously.  PPM uses cookies to allow PPM to determine which products and services you have already purchased so that PPM does not provide redundant information to you, and to track PPM sales made to customers referred by you so that you can receive compensation under our affiliate program.  If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the PPM web site, you may not be able to view all the text on the screens, or to experience a personalised visit, or to subscribe to certain service and product offerings on the PPM site.

**5.** | **Disclosure, Processing and Retention**  
---|---  
  
PPM does not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to anyone else except, when the Identified Purposes require PPM to disclose the personal information to:

(a) | an agent of the customer;  
---|---  
  
(b) | agents of PPM acting on its behalf for the Identified Purposes;  
---|---  
  
(c) | a public authority, to avoid or minimize danger to life or property; and  
---|---  
  
(d) | a third party to which disclosure is required by any law, regulation, legal process or government request.  
---|---  
  
Your information may be stored and processed in the  United States , or in any other country in which PPM or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities.  By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  PPM abides by the “safe harbor” framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

After your account becomes inactive, PPM will keep your personal information only for those purposes which are established by law, and for archival record purposes.

**6.** | **Accuracy of Personal Information**  
---|---  
  
PPM will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information.  Customers are responsible for informing PPM about changes to their personal information.  PPM will update personal information when necessary to keep it accurate or else provide customers the facility to make such updates. 

PPM will use reasonable efforts to protect personal information against loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse or modification, through security safeguards that depend on the level of sensitivity of the information.  Methods of protection include organizational measures (contract provisions, security clearance, limiting access to need-to-know PPM personnel), technological measures (passwords, encryption), and physical measures (locked file storage, security card access).  PPM will control personal information disclosed to authorized third parties by entering into agreements which contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on use and which limit the amount of information disclosed to only that which is needed for the Identified Purposes.

This Privacy Policy, and all updates to the Privacy Policy made from time to time, are published and made available to PPM’s customers on its web site [www.piedpipermarketing.com/privacy.html](http://www.myemailmanager.com/privacy.html).  It is the customer’s obligation to periodically check the PPM web site for Privacy Policy updates.

**9.** | **Access to Personal Information**  
---|---  
  
PPM will afford you a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in your file, in understandable format, either by direct access or upon request to the Privacy Officer made by you after providing sufficient identification.

If PPM is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customer’s personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney–client privileged communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.

Customers have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate, and PPM will promptly correct such personal information or provide the means for you to do so directly.

**10.** | **Challenging Compliance**  
---|---  
  
PPM wants to ensure that its Privacy Policy meets its customers’ needs.  If you feel that the Privacy Policy needs improvement, or believe that PPM is not following its Privacy Policy, please contact the [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacy@piedpipermarketing.com).

PPM will investigate your suggestions and complaints concerning the PPM Privacy Policy. If a complaint is found to be justified, PPM will take appropriate measures to resolve the complaint including, if necessary, amending its policies and procedures. Each customer will be informed of the outcome of the investigation regarding the customer’s complaint.
