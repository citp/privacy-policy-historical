<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a
standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below,
"What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect
information about how our Web site is used. Information
gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the
date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our
Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after
our Web site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to
Us?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of
administering our business activities, providing the products
and services you requested, to process your payment, , to
monitor the use of the service, our marketing and promotional
efforts and improve our content and service offerings, and
customize our site's content, layout, services and for other
lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor
it to meet your needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an
aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or
business information will not be shared with parties except as
required by law.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to
notify you about important changes to our Website, new
services, and special offers we think you will find valuable.
You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive
these offers by emailing us at the link provided on the
newsletter.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>What Are Cookies?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an
anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that
site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this
file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for
cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser
if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your
privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you
by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may
alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If
you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible
that some areas of our site will not function as effectively
when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other
data from your hard drive or pass on computer
viruses.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from
Cookies?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use
cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is
necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web
server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number
of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are
most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly
improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do
not allow us to gather any personal information about you and
we do not intentionally store any personal information that
your browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>IP Addresses</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are
connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is
used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP
addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part
of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that
data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to
you.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information
that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or
personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is
necessary to process transactions or provide services that you
have requested.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your
Information?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
You may request access to all your personally identifiable
information that we collect online and maintain in our database
by emailing us at the usual address.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of
Information?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in
other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law
requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may
also disclose account information when we have reason to
believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may
be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of
our users and the Public.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web
Site?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites
linked to or from our Web site or the information or content
contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided
solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful
to the users of our Web site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website
to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including
web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that
Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules
and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Your Consent</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of
your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time
with or without notice.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Please note that your information will be stored and processed
on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding
personal data in the United States may be less stringent than
the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To
prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
the correct use of information, we have put in place
appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
safeguard and secure the information we collect
online.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not
receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will
discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as
technically feasible.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via
surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests
is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
whether or not to disclose this information. Information
requested may include contact information (such as name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify
the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used
for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and
satisfaction of this site.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>A Special Note About Children</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and
we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any
personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use
this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance
from your parents or guardians.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its
assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part
of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are
transferred.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
<strong>Policy Modifications</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Microsoft Sans Serif">
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when
changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users
who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes
here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be
assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we
will not use the personal information you have submitted to us
under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially
inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior
consent.<br></span></p>
