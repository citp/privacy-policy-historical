    <h1 class="page-title">Instructure, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Instructure, Inc. ("<strong>Instructure</strong>")
  is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices
  regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our websites, located at <a href="http://www.instructure.com">
  http://www.instructure.com</a> and <a href="http://canvas.instructure.com">
  http://canvas.instructure.com/</a> (<strong>“Site</strong>”) and/or the services or functionality made available or enabled via the Site by Instructure, to
  facilitate the sharing of information and collaboration between students, teachers and administrators
  (“<strong>Services</strong>”). &nbsp;This Privacy Policy applies to you
  if you are 13 years old or older. &nbsp;If you are under the age of 13, your school’s privacy policy applies to
  you and we provide the Site and Services on behalf of your school.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>User Consent.</strong> By submitting Personal Data
    through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the
    processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>

    <li><strong>A Note About Children.</strong> &nbsp;We do not intentionally
    gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13, except to the extent we provide services to those
    visitors on behalf of schools. &nbsp;More specifically, a school (or a teacher, on behalf of a school) may contract
    with us to offer our service solely for the benefit of its students and for the school’s system. &nbsp;It is
    up to the schools for which we act as a service provider to obtain the parents’ consent for the collection
    and use of their children’s Personal Data. &nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>A Note to Users Outside of the United States.</strong> Your
    Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the
    United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your
    country.</li>

    <li><strong>Types of Data We Collect.</strong> Instructure collects Personal
    Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Site, when you send us information or communications, and/or
    when you use our Services. <strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means
    data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number,
    e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of
    the foregoing data. <strong>“Anonymous Data”</strong> means data that
    is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of
    individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Data You Provide to Us.</strong> We collect Personal
        Data from you, such as first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, company name,
        and password when you create an account to log in to our network. When you order Services on our Site, we will
        collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, which may include your name, credit card information,
        billing information and shipping information. We also may retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages
        that you store using your account. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name
        and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any
        information that you submit to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect
        additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our Site, the information contained
        in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. We also collect other types
        of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as operating system and version and other requested
        information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services. We may also collect Personal Data,
        such as demographic information, from you via the Services or at other points in our Site that state that Personal
        Data is being collected.</li>

        <li><strong>Data Collected via Technology.</strong> To make our Site and
        Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect
        information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is
        automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain
        name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like
        Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions
        and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather
        this data and store it in log files each time you visit our Site or access your account on our network.
        “<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of information that a
        website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies
        (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete
        them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed
        by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Site may
        not work properly.</li>

        <li><strong>Data That We Collect from You About Others.</strong> If you
        decide to create an account for and invite a third party to join our network, we will collect your and the third
        party’s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. You or the
        third party may contact us at privacy@instructure.com to request the removal of this information from our
        database.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use of Your Data</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>General Use.</strong> In general, Personal Data you
        submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. Instructure
        uses your Personal Data in the following ways: to facilitate the creation of and secure your account on our
        network; to identify you as a user in our system; to provide improved administration of our Site and Services; to
        improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site and Services; to send you a welcome e-mail to
        verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your account was created; to send you administrative e-mail
        notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; to respond to your inquiries related to
        employment opportunities or other requests; to send promotional communications; to provide you with hardcopy or
        electronic newsletters or surveys; to send upgrades and special offers related to our Services and for other
        marketing purposes of Instructure; and to make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary
        fraud protection or to solicit your feedback.</li>

        <li><strong>Student Records and Information.</strong> To provide the
        Services, Instructure may require (a) you to provide Personal Data about yourself and (b) you to provide Personal
        Data about other users. &nbsp;You represent and warrant that your provision of such Personal Data to Instructure
        does not violate any provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (“<strong>FERPA</strong>”). &nbsp;To the extent you are required to pass-down any obligations
        regarding Personal Data to Instructure in order to comply with FERPA, you are required to provide Instructure
        written notice thereof under the Subscription Agreement or Terms of Use you entered into with Instructure (as
        applicable).</li>

        <li><strong>Creation of Anonymous Data.</strong> We may create Anonymous Data
        records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable
        to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our
        Services and improve Site navigation. Instructure reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third
        parties at its discretion.</li>

        <li><strong>Feedback.</strong> If you provide feedback on any of our Services
        to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal
        Data. Instructure will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Data in
        such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> Although we currently do not have
        a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively,
        <strong>“Affiliates”</strong>), we may in the future. We may share some or
        all of your Personal Data with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy
        Policy. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data
        collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this
        Privacy Policy.</li>

        <li><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> Regardless of any choices you make
        regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Instructure may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good
        faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants
        served on Instructure; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Instructure or users of the
        Services.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third Parties</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Social Networking Websites.</strong> &nbsp;We may from
        time to time provide applications for certain social networking websites (“<strong>Social
        Networking Websites</strong>”) (e.g., a Facebook application). &nbsp;If you choose to install and use
        those applications, Instructure may share information with the Social Networking Website to support your use of the
        application. &nbsp;For example, if you use the application to publish Instructure related notices on your Facebook
        wall, we will provide Facebook the applicable information. &nbsp;If you do not want us to continue to provide your
        information to the Social Networking Site, change your privacy settings in the Social Networking Site and in
        the application to opt-out of the Social Networking Site. &nbsp;If you opt-out, certain features of our Service
        and/or of the Social Networking Site may not be available to you. &nbsp;The privacy policies of the Social
        Networking Sites may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information that we collect and disclose to
        such Social Networking Sites. &nbsp;Because we do not control the privacy practices of the Social Networking Sites,
        you should read and understand their privacy policies.</li>

        <li><strong>Third Party Websites.</strong> &nbsp;Our provision of a link or
        application that links to any other website or location (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, or Skype), is for your
        convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click
        on such a link/app, you will leave our Site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect
        Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for,
        these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to
        these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links/apps to such outside
        websites.</li>

        <li><strong>Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers.</strong> Except as
        otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from
        our services to other entities. However, we may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to
        provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Site, conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate
        creation of accounts, provide technical support, or provide specific services to Instructure. &nbsp; For example we
        use Google and Scribd to provide document services. &nbsp;These third party service providers are required not
        to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Instructure. You expressly consent to the
        sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and other service providers for the sole purpose of providing
        services to you.</li>
      </ol>
    
    <li class="c9" value="8"><strong>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data</strong></li>
      <ol class="c4">
        <li value="1"><strong>Choices.</strong> We offer you choices regarding the
        collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that

        us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the
        opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive
        or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). &nbsp;However, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.</li>

        <li><strong>Changes to Personal Data.</strong> You may change certain aspects of the
        Personal Data in your account by editing your profile within the Service or by sending an e-mail to us at the
        e-mail address set forth below. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we may
        be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it or to keep this information for a
        certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such
        requirements. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our
        archives.</li>
      </ol>
    
    <li><strong>Security of Your Personal Data.</strong> Instructure is
    committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard security
    technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We
    also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account
