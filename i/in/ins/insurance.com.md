PRIVACY STATEMENT AND Q & A

 **1\. Introduction**

Insurance.com has created this Privacy Statement and Q & A in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (insurance.com) and a similar site accessible through the Insurance Center at www.fidelity.com. The statement also discloses how your information is used by other companies we do business with. 

**2\. What organizations have access to my nonpublic personally identifiable information?**

  1. **Insurance.com and its Fidelity affiliates**  
On the Insurance.com website, we have a variety of areas where you can input information: for storage, to calculate insurance premiums or quotes, to register with Insurance.com and to process insurance purchase requests. We also gather information about your internet address to help understand site usage. In addition, we receive information collected by the insurance agencies or insurance companies that respond to your on-line requests, including application information and information about the insurance policies you purchase. Insurance.com and its technology or marketing service providers may have access to this information, and Insurance.com shares this information from time to time with its Fidelity affiliates in financial services businesses, such as securities brokerage.
  2. **Quoting Providers**  
In most cases, the quoting process is anonymous; that is, you do not have to identify yourself or provide information by which you could be identified in order to obtain quote information. (See 2.e., regarding quotes obtained through Comparison Market Insurance Agency.) Should you wish to gain quotes for a particular line of insurance, information will be collected (for example car model, coverage amount, etc.) that is shared by Insurance.com with a third-party quoting provider in order to match your information to a list of quotes. Each quoting provider has agreed with us that this information will be used by them only in connection with services you request. 
  3. **Insurance Agencies and Insurance Carriers - - In General**  
Should you decide to apply for a particular insurance policy after obtaining a quote through one of our quoting providers, you will be asked to provide additional information needed to complete an insurance application. With your authorization, this information will be forwarded either (1) to an independent insurance agency which has been appointed by the insurance carrier you select and which has agreed to use the information only for the purposes of completing your transaction with the carrier, or (2) directly to the carrier that you have chosen or its affiliated insurance agency. Carriers use personally identifiable information (such as name and address) in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs to provide an insurance premium estimate. However, the criteria for ratings may vary between participating insurance companies, with each carrier placing a different emphasis on particular items of information you provide. Where permitted by law, your personally identifiable information may be used to verify information that you have provided, to request a credit report or review your claims history from a third party. As your application proceeds, Insurance.com may be updated of your progress. PLEASE NOTE: The insurance carriers are required by law to have their own privacy policies, which likely differ from those of Insurance.com. You may wish to obtain and review the carriers' policies.
  4. **Health Insurance**  
If you are interested in health insurance, please see the Health Insurance Privacy Policy of Insurance.com and eHealthInsurance Services, Inc.
  5. **Auto Insurance - - Comparison Market Insurance Agency (Comparison Market)**  
In certain states, currently just Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin, we work with ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency to provide you with auto insurance quotes and other services. In states where ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency is available, ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency requests certain personal information during the quote process in an effort to provide more accurate quote information. Residents of those states are encouraged to see the Comparison Market Privacy Policy.
  6. **Travel Insurance**  
If you are interested in travel insurance, please see the Travel Insurance Privacy Policy of Insurance.com and Insuractive, Inc.
  7. **Links to Third Party Insurance Sites**   
In some states, or for some lines of coverage (e.g., homeowners or renters coverage and pet health coverage), we may provide direct links to insurance company or insurance agency sites, usually because we cannot obtain comparative quote information. If you provide information on a carrier web site or purchase insurance from a carrier as a result of visiting Insurance.com, the carrier may share that information with Insurance.com, but Insurance.com will not share it with any unaffiliated third parties. Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third party insurance companies or the content of their web sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements on the sites of each insurance company or third party agent with which you interact.
  8. **Other Third Party Links**  
You also have the opportunity to purchase books through links with unaffiliated on-line sellers. If you visit those sellers' sites, information (such as type of book, number of sales, etc.), but no personal information, will be shared with Insurance.com. Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices on these third party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements on these sites. 



**3\. How is my nonpublic personally identifiable information used?**

  1. **Providing Services You Request**  
Information that you provide during the quoting process is used to fulfill your requests for insurance quotes or applications. Information you provide during the registration or application process is:   

    * used to facilitate your requests for insurance quotes or applications; 
    * used to distribute newsletters, optional user experience surveys or other marketing and promotional materials, unless you opt not to receive this information; and 
    * stored by our service providers or within the Insurance.com site in order to enable you to re-access the information at your convenience.
  2. **Site Usage - - Cookies**  
Insurance.com also gathers anonymous information and aggregate demographic information, which does not personally identify you. We use this information to better understand our site usage patterns, and we may share this information with third parties for marketing or technology purposes. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and the use of "Cookies," "Internet Protocol" addresses or other numeric codes or tags used to identify a computer. Again, any disclosure of anonymous information and/or aggregate demographic information will not reveal any personally identifiable information about specific users.

A 'cookie' is a message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a small text file on the same drive that the browser is installed on. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. It will not be used to help track user's aggregate data from sites other than our own.

However, we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of our web site with quoting aggregators, participating insurance companies or other companies we do business with; in this case, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed.
