**Q:What organizations have access to my nonpublic personally identifiable information? **

**A** : The following organizations have access to your nonpublic personally identifiable information: 

  1. **Insurance.com**

On the Insurance.com website, we have a variety of areas where you can input information: for storage, to calculate insurance premiums or quotes, and to process insurance purchase requests. We also gather information about your Internet address to help understand site usage. In addition, we receive information collected by the insurance agencies or insurance companies that respond to your online requests, including application information and information about the insurance policies you purchase. Insurance.com and its technology or marketing service providers may have access to this information, and Insurance.com shares this information.

  2. **Quoting Providers**

For most products, the quoting process is anonymous; that is, you do not have to identify yourself or provide information by which you could be identified in order to obtain quote information. Auto insurance quotes require some personal information in order to provide accurate rates. Auto insurance rates are based on you – who you are, where you live, your driving record, etc. in addition to vehicle information (See 7, regarding quotes obtained through ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency.) Should you wish to gain quotes for a particular line of insurance, information will be collected (for example car model, coverage amount, etc.) that is shared by Insurance.com with a third-party insurance quoting provider in order to match your information to a list of quotes. Each quoting provider has agreed with us that this information will be used by them only in connection with services **you specifically request**. 

  3. **Insurance Agencies and Insurance Carriers – In General**

Should you decide to apply for a particular insurance policy after obtaining a quote through one of our quoting providers, you will be asked to provide additional information needed to complete an insurance application. With your authorization, this information will be forwarded either (1) to an independent insurance agency which has been appointed by the insurance carrier you select and which has agreed to use the information only for the purposes of completing your transaction with the carrier, or (2) directly to the carrier that you have chosen or its affiliated insurance agency. Carriers use personally identifiable information (such as name and address) in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs to provide an insurance premium estimate. However, the criteria for ratings may vary between participating insurance companies, with each carrier placing a different emphasis on particular items of information you provide. Where permitted by law, your personally identifiable information may be used to verify information that you have provided, to request a credit report or review your claims history from a third party. As your application proceeds, Insurance.com may be updated of your progress. PLEASE NOTE: The insurance carriers are required by law to have their own privacy policies, which likely differ from those of Insurance.com. You may wish to obtain and review the carriers' policies. 

  4. **Life Insurance**  

  5. **Health Insurance**  

  6. **Dental Insurance**  

  7. **Auto Insurance – ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency (ComparisonMarket)**

ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency provides auto insurance quotes and other services in all states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Massachusetts. In situations where ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency is available, ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency requests certain required personal information during the quote process in an effort to provide more accurate quote information. Residents of those states are encouraged to see the ComparisonMarket Privacy Policy In situations where you are referred to a single insurance carrier, please refer to the privacy policy listed on that insurance carrier’s site.

  8. **Travel Insurance**

If you are interested in travel insurance, please see the [Travel Insurance Privacy Policy](http://www.worldtravelcenter.com/eng/cobrands/inscom/privacy.cfm "Travel Insurance Privacy Policy") of Insurance.com and Insuractive, Inc. 

  9. **Links to Third Party Insurance Sites**

In some states, or for some lines of coverage (e.g., homeowners or renters coverage; pet health coverage; auto coverage in MA, HI, AK), we may provide direct links to insurance company or insurance agency sites, usually because we cannot obtain comparative quote information. If you provide information on a carrier website or purchase insurance from a carrier as a result of visiting Insurance.com, the carrier may share that information with Insurance.com, but Insurance.com will not share it with any unaffiliated third parties. Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third party insurance companies or the content of their websites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements on the sites of each insurance company or third party agent with which you interact. 




**Q:How is my nonpublic personally identifiable information used?**

**A** : Your nonpublic personally identifiable information is used in the following ways: 

  1. **Providing Services You Request**  
Information that you provide during the quoting process is used to fulfill your requests for insurance quotes or applications. Information you provide during the registration or application process is: 
    1. used to facilitate your requests for insurance quotes or applications; 
    2. used to distribute newsletters, optional user experience surveys or other marketing and promotional materials to you, unless you opt not to receive this information ; and 
    3. stored by our service providers or within the Insurance.com site in order to enable you to re-access the information at your convenience. 
  2. **Site Usage – Cookies**  


Insurance.com also gathers **anonymous** information and aggregate demographic information (such as age, zip code, etc.), which does **not** personally identify you. We use this information to better understand our site usage patterns, and we may share this information with third parties for marketing or technology purposes. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and the use of "Cookies," "Internet Protocol" addresses or other numeric codes or tags used to identify a computer. Again, any disclosure of anonymous information and/or aggregate demographic information will not reveal any personally identifiable information about specific users. 

A 'cookie' is a message given to a web browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a small text file on the same drive that the browser is installed on. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. It will not be used to help track user's aggregate data from sites other than our own. The only cookie-based data that we track is activity on our own site concerning demographics and site usage analysis. The user needs to have cookies enabled in order to use restricted features of the site, including the auto quoting process. 

  3. **Quoting**

There is no requirement to register or login prior to requesting a quote. As noted above, we share this information with third party quote providers in order to obtain the quote information you request. ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency provides auto insurance quotes and other services for residents of all states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Massachusetts. Residents of those states serviced by ComparisonMarket will be asked for certain personal information, including a credit report authorization. This additional information is requested in an effort to provide you with more accurate quote information. 

  4. **No Other Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties**

Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we do not willfully disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, other than the above-described parties with which we contract to make certain services available through our website and which have agreed that they will keep your information confidential. However, we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of our website with quoting aggregators, participating insurance companies or other companies we do business with; in this case, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed. 




**Q:What choices are available to me regarding the collection, use and distribution of my nonpublic personally identifiable information? **

**A:** You may decide to opt-out of communications from Insurance.com. Users registering during the health insurance application process will automatically be placed on the email distribution list that provides you with information concerning promotions and updates to the Insurance.com site and all communications regarding your health insurance request. 

Except as noted in the next paragraph, during the quoting process on Insurance.com you will always retain complete control over what information you disclose in the quoting / application processes and to which insurance carriers, if any, it is sent. You will be asked for your name, contact details and other information only if you decide to proceed with coverage from a company that has offered an online quote. 

ComparisonMarket provides auto insurance quotes and other services for residents of all states except Alaska, Hawaii, and Massachusetts. Residents of those states serviced by ComparisonMarket will be asked for certain personal information, including a credit report authorization, in order to return accurate rates. This additional information is a standard request in the auto insurance industry. 

With respect to third party sites to which you may link through Insurance.com, any choices regarding the handling of your personal information will be described on such parties' websites. You should refer to the privacy statements for those sites for more information. 

During the health application process you will automatically opt-in to an email distribution list that will provide you with information concerning promotions and updates concerning the Insurance.com site. Upon receipt of an email communication you will have the option to opt-out of receiving any further communications. 

**Q:What security measures are in place to protect my nonpublic personally identifiable information? **

**A:** This site uses strong security measures to protect the personal data you provide. Your personal data is stored on a system not directly connected to the Internet. We use a variety of security systems and control measures to restrict access to your data. We use authentication methods to confirm the identity of trusted parties. We support encryption technologies to protect the transmission of your data when you are supplying it, or if we are passing it to other companies we do business with. 

**Q:How can I correct any inaccuracies in my nonpublic personally identifiable information? **

**A:** Within the quoting process, you are able to change your information by returning to the previous page via the back button of the browser, or by verifying and editing the information prior to submission. 

**Q:How will I know if this privacy statement changes?**

**A:** Insurance.com may change its privacy practices in the future. If we change the way we treat any nonpublic personally identifiable information, we will: 

  * Post a revised privacy policy at this location; and 
  * In the event the change could affect your nonpublic personally identifiable information already in our database, we will email you to notify you of the change and include an option for you to opt-out of the process. 



**Q:How can I “opt out” of receiving any email from you? **

Occasionally, we may email you our quarterly insurance newsletter or to let you know about new products, features, or insurance companies that we’ve added.
