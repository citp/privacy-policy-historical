## 1\. GENERAL MATTERS 

**Overview**

Welcome to the Insurance.com web site, located at [www.insurance.com](http://www.insurance.com/) and other domain names which we may adopt from time to time (“Site(s)”). Protecting our visitors' privacy and security is a top priority for our company. For this reason, we have adopted the following Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to advise you of your choices regarding the use of your personal information online. By accessing and using this Site, you agree to this Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about-us/terms-of-service.aspx).

If we decide to change our privacy policy or our email practices, we will post those changes to this Policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review it from time to time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

**Scope of Policy**

This Policy only applies to the following sites: www.insurance.com and www.comparisonmarket.com and does not apply to other companies' or organizations' web sites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those web sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information.

## 2\. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM VISITORS AND HOW WE USE IT 

_We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily choose to disclose such information while taking advantage of the services on our Site._

**Personal Information** includes your name, street and e-mail address, phone number, credit card number, social security number, marital status, date of birth, gender, occupation, education level, driver's license number, prior insurance coverage, Vehicle Identification Number “VIN”, make, model and number of vehicles in your household (“Personal Information”). Examples of when we collect Personal Information include the following:

  * **Online Interview**. In order to take advantage of the services on our Sites you must provide certain Personal Information to us during the online client interview process (“Interview”). Personal Information is used to facilitate your requests for insurance quotes or applications. 
  * **Offline Interview**. If you take advantage of our services through our call center with one of our licensed insurance agents, your Personal Information will be collected during such offline interview (“Interview”) and incorporated into our electronic system so we can fulfill the products/services selected by you. 
  * **Post-Interview Information**. Additional Personal Information, such as method of payment and social security numbers will be collected from you during the post Interview process in order to fulfill any orders for services or products made by you. 
  * **Transaction Information**. Your Personal Information may be collected and used by us to track transactions conducted on our Sites including which products/services you selected and information we require for payment. 
  * **Sweepstakes and Surveys**. You will be asked to disclose Personal Information if you elect to participate in any sweepstakes or surveys we offer on the Sites from time to time.



## 3\. OPT-IN / OPT-OUT 

**Opt-In.** When you take advantage of the services offered on our Sites, you will automatically receive commercial and promotional email messages from us to let you know about new products, services, features offered by us and participating insurance companies. We will not share your Personal Information with third parties who will send commercial email to you unless you Opt-In to receive email from them. A consumer may opt-in by visiting those third parties' sites. Any email sent by us or one of our partners will always include an opportunity to Opt-Out from receiving future email.

**Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to receive email from us, or our partners, you may Opt-Out by checking the opt-out box, during the Interview process. You may also opt-out by clicking on the “contact us” link in our application. Please be aware that each Interview is considered a new visitor session. This means that if you Opt-Out during the Interview you will not receive any email from Insurance.com. However, if you begin a new Interview at a later time, unless you Opt-Out during that session, you will receive email from us.

**How to Opt-Out**. Every communication we send you will contain a clearly worded "Opt-Out" or "Unsubscribe" link allowing you to withdraw your permission for future e-mails. Alternatively, you can send a blank e-mail to [feedback@insurance.com](mailto:feedback@insurance.com?subject=Remove) and type "Remove" in the subject field. This system is automated and must be contacted from the email address you wish to have removed.

Permission changes will be honored as soon as possible after receipt. Please allow seven to ten business days for processing. Permission changes will not affect any information which you previously provided to us and which we previously shared with our business partners.

## 4\. COLLECTION OF NON-PERSONAL AGGREGATE DATA

We gather non personally identifiable information (“Aggregate Data”) with respect to our visitors' use of the Sites to determine the extent to which our visitors use certain parts of the Sites, which, in turn, enables us to make the Sites as useful as possible. We may provide Aggregate Data about the use of our Sites with quoting aggregators, participating insurance carriers and our business partners.

## 5\. COOKIES, BEACONS, SESSION ID AND IP ADDRESSES

**Cookies.** We use a technology called "cookies" on the Sites. Cookies are pieces of information that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies collect technical data and identify your operating system and session ID. They can also save information you may have previously provided and help us recognize your computer when you return to the Sites. Cookies are not linked to your Personal Information and do not identify anything personal about you.

**How Can One Disable Cookies**? Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies; however, this may limit your ability to take full advantage of the features offered on the Sites.

**Web Beacons.** We use web beacons, which allow our partners to place a cookie on an end user's computer when they visit one of our partner sites so that when the end-user visits our Sites, that cookie data is tracked by our partner and our partner can identify that the end-user achieved a certain milestone. This is a tracking concept used commonly on the Internet, also referred to as "pixel tracking."

**Session ID.** We collect all end-user data based off of a session ID. This is how we organize answers to our questions. This in-house convention allows us to use an end-user's session ID to see all of the end-user input for one quote.

**IP Addresses**. We collect and analyze traffic on our Sites by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Policy covers the use of cookies by Insurance.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. We do not use cookies in conjunction with emails.

## 6\. WHEN WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Insurance Carriers**. An insurance carrier and/or an independent insurance agency appointed by an insurance carrier will use your Personal Information in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs to create an insurance premium estimate. Ratings criteria vary between participating providers, with each carrier placing emphasis on particular items of information you provide. Please Note: Third party insurance carriers have their own privacy policies and we are not responsible for these policies nor the products and/or services offered by third party providers so please make sure to review the privacy policy of any third party carrier from whom you may purchase a policy.

**Financial, Credit and Government Agencies.** In order to provide you with our services, and only where permitted by law, we share your Personal Information with: (1) financial service providers who provide comparative rates; (2) certified credit bureaus to verify information about your credit report; (3) Department of Motor Vehicles to verify your driving record, previous claims history, vehicles and VIN and other relevant information. Your Personal Information is maintained by credit agencies and disclosed by them to others as permitted by law.

**Service Providers.** Sometimes third party service providers are retained or utilized by us and may have access to our visitors' Personal Information. This information is required in order to generate accurate and bindable insurance rates. Please be aware, while we take steps to protect third party use of Personal Information through confidentiality agreements and restrictions on access to and use of such information, there is no means for us to police the activities of third parties' use of Personal Information disclosed to them.

## 7\. DISCLOSURE EXCEPTIONS

We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary including, without limitation:

  * To comply with a legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, state or federal law; 
  * To protect our company's rights and/or property; 
  * To investigate reports of visitors providing false or misleading information; 
  * To protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Sites and/or service; 
  * To prevent or investigate reports of credit card fraud or unauthorized use; or 
  * During emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk.



## 8\. SECURITY

**Electronic Security.** The security of your Personal Information and email address are important to us. When you provide Personal Information including, without limitation, your payment information and/or social security number during the Interview or purchase process, we encrypt the information by using advanced encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect the transfer and storage of your Personal Information. In addition, during the Interview process, you are on secure pages of our Sites and a lock or key icon appears on the bottom of your web browser screen.

**Physical Security.** All Personal Information is restricted in our offices. Employees are only granted access on a need-to-know basis. In addition, the servers on which we store Personal Information are kept in a secure environment. Our main servers are operated from a dedicated Internet hosting facility with state-of-the-art physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24x7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we follow accepted industry standards and implement reasonable security practices to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of our Sites, you can send an email to [privacyconcerns@insurance.com](mailto:privacyconcerns@insurance.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy) or call the Privacy Sites phone number at 888-740-4328.

## 9\. ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

**How to Correct or Change Your Quote Information.** You can access the quote information you provided and update it at any point during the Interview by navigating to previous pages and making the necessary changes. Upon completing the Interview, you may review and/or modify your Personal Information and/or email address by selecting the “modify” button on the rates page and get a revised quote reflecting the changes you have made. When you save your quote information, you can return to the Sites and change your information at anytime as long as you have not yet purchased a policy. Simply log onto the Sites, select the applicable insurance for which you requested a quote, and select Retrieve My Quote. To change your information type the new data and click the Continue button.

**Editing Your Personal Information.** If your Personal Information or email address changes or you want to edit or update your information you can do so by emailing our Customer Support, or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

**Implementing Change Request.** We will use reasonable efforts to make the changes you requested but it is not always possible to modify database information. In addition, if your Personal Information and email address has been provided to third parties, we will not be able to make changes to it. Further, such information is never completely removed from our database due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personal Information would be removed from our database in response to your request.

**Live Chat.** We provide a live chat feature on our Sites. When used during business hours, this feature does not collect any personally identifiable information. When used after business hours to send us a message, this feature collects your name and email address. We use this information to communicate with you regarding your inquiry.

**California Residents.** As of January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors of these Sites who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail, or contact us by telephone or send a letter to the numbers and addresses included above.

## 10\. OTHER MATTERS

**Third Party Links.** In some states, or for certain lines of coverage (including, but not limited to, homeowners or renters coverage, pet health coverage, auto coverage) we may provide direct links to insurance company or agency web sites if we cannot obtain comparative quote information. If you purchase insurance from these third party carriers as a result of visiting our Sites the carrier may share your Personal Information with us regarding the policy which is purchased and related information but we will not share the information with unaffiliated third parties. Please Note: when you purchase third party products and/or services from third party web sites, you become their customer and are subject to their privacy policies. Please be aware that Insurance.com, Inc. is not responsible for third party privacy practices even if our name or logos appear on third party sites. We encourage you to review these companies' privacy policies and only do business with those who adhere to personal information practices with which you are comfortable.

**Do Not Share Disclosure.** We do not sell, rent or trade your Personal Information or email address with third parties for their promotional purposes. However, we may use the information to direct traffic to approved partner sites. If that practice were to change, we would offer you the means to opt out of this type of information sharing.

**Who Should Use Our Site?** Our Site is for insurance products and services and is not intended for children. We offer insurance products and services and thus do not market any products or services to children under the age of thirteen or knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information.

**Sale of Assets.** If we are ever sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we reserve the right to transfer our databases, together with any Personal Information or email address contained therein, to a third-party acquiring our company assets. If we do so, we will place a prominent notice of the sale on the homepage of our Sites, with links to information as to how you can change your privacy preferences.
