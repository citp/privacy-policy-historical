            <p>Thank you for visiting this website (the "Site"), made available to you by instaGrok inc. ("instaGrok"). instaGrok is committed to protecting your privacy. We've developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose, and make use of personal information that you provide to us on this Site. By using the Site and voluntarily providing personal information in connection with your registration or use, you are consenting to our use of the information you provide as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3 class="title">The Information We Collect</h3>
            <h4>Required Personal Information</h4>
            <p>The site can be used without creating an account. Certain features, however, require registration. If you register as a General user or as a Teacher/Librarian, you will be asked to provide your email address, a user ID of your choosing, and a password. If a payment is necessary, you will be asked to provide credit card or billing information. If you register as a student, you will be asked to provide a user ID of your choosing and a password. Teachers and Students are asked to associate their accounts with specific classes.</p>

            <p>If you are accessing instaGrok through another website that offers single-sign-on to multiple applications, that other service's privacy policy may override instaGrok's.</p>

            <h4>Other Collected Information</h4>

            <p>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Site, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, the IP address you are using to connect to the Site, and the name of your Internet service provider. This type of information helps us ensure consistent delivery of the Site and improve our services.</p>

            <p>We also collect information on how you use the Site, such as what topics users have researched.</p>
            
            <h3 class="title">Cookies</h3>

            <p>Like most major websites, we may use "cookies" to store information during your use of our Site. Cookies are small pieces of code that are stored in a designated file on your computer. They do not provide us with any personally identifiable information and cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>

            <p>We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, and to help us both understand how our Site is used and improve the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site). If you would prefer not to receive any cookies, most browsers can be set to refuse cookies or to alert you when one is being sent. It is possible, however, that some portions of this Site may not function properly if the cookies are disabled.</p>

            <p>Third parties such as advertisers may add a cookie to help analyze web traffic or to determine targeted advertisements based on your preferences and your visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.
