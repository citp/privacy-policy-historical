Overview

IMT encourages you to visit our web sites knowing that you have complete control over your personal information. You can browse our pages without having to tell us who you are or revealing any personal information whatsoever. However, if you communicate with our customer service department via online chat, email or phone, you might supply us with personal information such as your name, email address and other contact information. Also, if you decide to purchase travel insurance, the applications will require you to input more information such as name and address, travel arrangements and credit card information in order for us to service you appropriately. We do indicate on these pages of the web site that we are collecting this information from you and the purposes for doing so, except where it is obvious. We will not use your personal information for other purposes without notifying you of our intention to do so and obtaining your consent. 

IMT is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites that are linked to or from our site. 

Information Gathering

The IMT web sites collect the following information only if you choose to provide it:

  * For a question or request ("Contact Us", "Service" and the "Live Chat" areas): 
    * Name, email address and any comments you make. 
  * For a quote: 
    * Coverage limits, dates of travel, age(s) or date(s) of birth for each traveller, destination, trip type, and residency. 
  * For a travel policy, on behalf of the insurance carriers, we collect from you and disclose to them the following information (in addition to above):

    * Credit card information. 



Using Information Gathered

The information collected when you contact us with a question or a suggestion will only be used to respond to and/or resolve your question.

The information collected for a quote or for a travel policy is used to provide policy quotes and to issue your policy. The information is in turn sent encrypted, only to the insurance company underwriting the policy and the producing agent if applicable. The insurance companies employ standard encryption practices receiving such information. 

IMT archives information provided by you for policy quoting and policy issuance on our servers located in the United States. This information is kept electronically, but is internal to IMT and not maintained on the web site. We collect and retain this information in accordance with all applicable laws, including without limitation insurance laws/laws governing insurance carriers. 

Sharing and Disclosing Information Gathered

In general, our sites will only collect data from you that will be used to respond to and/or resolve your question, to provide accurate quotes, and to issue policies.

We do track the domain name, IP address, browser type, and referring IP address of our site visitors through a site-reporting tool that runs on our servers and uses cookies. This information is used internally only to show activity and trends of our website's usage and to aid in the user experience. Cookies are not used to capture or store personal information for any other purpose. 

We do not provide your personal information to mailing lists nor do we sell, share or trade your information to others for any purpose. 

From time to time, we may be required to provide your personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. 

Protecting Information Gathered

IMT uses Secure Socket Layer encryption (SSL) to protect the privacy of your information.

IMT does not control the privacy practices of the companies which we represent; however, all the companies use the information you provide for the purpose of issuing an accurate insurance policy. Quote information is not shared with any of the insurance companies. It is your choice whether to provide personal information to IMT. If you choose to give us the personal information, refer to this privacy statement for an understanding of how that information will be collected, used and/or disclosed or distributed. 

You are entitled to access the personal information which we have gathered about you and to request corrections of that information. In order to do so, please direct your request to [service@insuremytrip.com](mailto:service@insuremytrip.com) and describe out your request or correction. 

Please refer to the privacy policy statements of the individual insurance companies for their use of your personal information.
