How Information is Collected.

Information Automatically Collected. We also collect information about your visit from the browser on your computer or mobile device including but not limited to the time and date you visit the InspireMore Services, your geographic location, IP address, device information, cookies and the pages you request — to analyze trends, administer the site, track your navigation of the site, deliver relevant advertisements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use (note that IP addresses are not linked to “personally identifiable information”). Additionally, we collect aggregate information from multiple users without personally identifying individuals, such as geographic region, which we may share with our business partners — to improve understanding of customer needs and provide relevant services.

Creating an InspireMore Account and Profile Information. There are two (2) types of InspireMore accounts that can be created, one account can be created for select authors chosen by InspireMore and the other account can be created by users from the general public. When you create a InspireMore account, you provide access credentials in the form of a username, email address, and password or by authentication using another service, such as Facebook.

Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.

**With Whom Information is Shared**

Public Information – InspireMore may share as it sees fit information that you voluntarily make public. Since such public information can be accessed by the public and used by any member of the public, such use by third parties is beyond the control of InspireMore.

When you post content on the InspireMore Services, we also collect, process, and store the contents of the InspireMore on our servers. The contents of the InspireMore Services can also be temporarily stored on the devices of users. We cannot prevent others from making copies of your content (e.g. taking a screenshot). You should not use InspireMore to send messages if you want to be certain that the general public cannot keep a copy.

Personal Information – If we have your express consent, InspireMore may share your personal information it collects with business partners and other third parties that are not affiliated with InspireMore. InspireMore will never share your personal information without your consent, unless compelled to do so by law.
