Privacy Policy.</h1> Aug 15, 2011
</div>
<div id="res" style="margin-left: 0px;">
<p>
InstantPeopleFinder.com is committed to protecting your privacy and your personal
information. The privacy policy listed below explains our information practices
so that you may better understand how your information is being used before you
choose to share it with us. This policy also discloses what types of information
we gather, track and share with other parties.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Your Personal Information and InstantPeopleFinder.com</h2>
<p>
You are free to visit our site at anytime without ever providing us with any personal
information about yourself. However, in some situations, you may choose to share
personal information with us or on our site For example, you may register with our
site, provide us with an contact information for communication purposes, or you
may choose to provide personal information in one of our user forums. If you share
your information with us but indicate that you do not want us to use that information
for anything further than fulfilling your request, we will respect that request.
If you choose to share personal information about another individual, we will assume
that you have their permission to share or distribute such information.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
User Forums</h2>
<p>
We provide users with the opportunity to share their own personal experiences and
information with other InstantPeopleFinder.com users by the following means:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 50px;">
<li>Comments on Public Profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you choose to provide information in any of these user forums, please be aware
that any personally identifiable information can be collected, read and used by
other users and third parties. This information can be used to send you unsolicited
messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you
choose to share on these forums
</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>
In some cases, you may see links or advertisements about information and data available
to you through other websites. For example, if you find certain limited information
through InstantPeopleFinder.com, you may be able to purchase more detailed information,
subject to certain terms and conditions, through a third party. These links or advertisements
may be presented to you using framing techniques, which means that, although it
appears you are still on our website, you have been transferred to the website of
a third party. You should carefully review the privacy policy of any advertised
or linked website before providing any personal information or purchasing any product
or service from them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
of third party websites.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Cookies and Other Online Technologies</h2>
<p>
We sometimes collect non-personally-identifiable information from visitors to the
site. We do this in order to provide our users with a better experience and service.
For instance, we may keep track of the domains from which people visit our site
and their activity within our site. This is done using cookies to ensure that the
visitor's identity remains anonymous.</p>
<p>
A cookie is a piece of data that we send to your browser. This is then stored on
your computer as an anonymous tag or identifier. It is possible to identify your
computer from this information, but not you personally. You may choose to set your
browser to notify you when receiving cookies or to turn off cookies altogether.
However, if you disallow cookies, keep in mind that some websites may not work properly.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Log Files</h2>
<p>
As with most websites, we gather certain information and automatically store it
in log files. This information can include IP address, browser type, Internet service
provider, operating system and clickstream data. This information does not individually
identify any users and is used to analyze trends and make improvements to our site
to provide a better user experience.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Personal Information and Children</h2>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect information relating to children. Our products are designed
for individuals who are over the age of 13 in accordance with COPPA (<a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.coppa.org/</a>). If we are made aware that we have
personal information from someone under the age of 13, we will take all reasonable
efforts to expunge that information from our records.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Disclosures Required By Law</h2>
<p>
In certain circumstances, we may be required to share any personal information you
have provided to us with others pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas,
warrants and orders.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Accuracy of Third Party Information</h2>
<p>
The substantive information provided by us on our site is aggregated from multiple
third party sources. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information, nor are
we responsible for how this information is being used by these third-parties. If
you have questions or concerns about this third party information, please review
the privacy policies and contact the appropriate third party.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
How to Remove your Information from Our Database</h2>
<p>
Public records are available from the official public records custodian or repository
to anyone who requests them. In order for any database of public records to be useful,
the databases must contain all of the information in the public records offices.
If you have a compelling privacy or security issue, you may wish to contact the
official custodians of those public records that contain sensitive information about
you, such as your county's land records office, to determine how to remove your
information from the public record. (The process of having public records sealed
typically requires a court order.) This process will ensure that the information
is not available to the public, to us, or to any other public records information
provider.</p>
<p>
In addition to public records, personal information may be publicly or commercially
available. Publicly available information consists of online and offline information
that is generally available but is not maintained by a government agency, such as
names, addresses and telephone numbers of individuals and businesses, professional
licensing and trade organization information, press releases and newspaper articles
and content from blogs or social networking sites. Commercial records consist of
information that is maintained by enterprises and is available for purchase, such
as marketing and telemarketing lists, phone connect and disconnect information,
and business profile data.</p>
<p>
As a courtesy we allow you to opt out your personal information from our website.
What this means is that your name as it appears in a particular record and the associated
identifying information such as your address and phone number will be suppressed
if you request this in the manner described below. However, please note that any
time your identifying information appears in a public record or in a publicly or
commercially available manner, in a way that is different from the particular record
you opted out, it will again appear on our website. For example, if your address
or area code changes, your new information -- including other associated identifying
information -- will again appear unless you opt out the new record. Similarly, if
the way in which your name or address appears in a record differs from a record
you opted out (e.g., "Michael" instead of "Mike," or "1212 Second AVE NE" instead
of "1212-2nd Avenue Northeast"), we may include the differing record. Please also
note that there may be more than one record on our website associated with your
personal information. Opting out one particular record will not opt out other record(s).
In addition to this website, there are many other companies offering public records
search services, and your request that we opt out your information from this website
will not prevent your information from appearing on these other services.</p>
<p>
In order for us to suppress or opt out your personal information from appearing
on our website, we need to verify your identity. To do this, we require faxed proof
of identity. Proof of identity can be a state issued ID card or driver's license.
If you are sending a scanned copy of your driver's license, we require that you
cross out the photo and the driver's license number. We only need to see the name,
address and date of birth. We will only use this information to process your opt
out request. Please send us a copy at <a href="mailto:optout@instantpeoplefinder.com">
optout@instantpeoplefinder.com</a>, fill the form at <a href="/optout.html">optout</a>
and allow 4 to 6 weeks to process your request.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
Please note that this privacy policy may change. All policy changes will be posted
to this page at the time of change.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">
