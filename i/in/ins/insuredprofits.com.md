**Use of Cookies**  
Insured Profits may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server to identify that specific user the next time he or she visits the website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.

We do not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as integrating another site that relies on third-party cookies into the existing website).

**Modifying cookie settings**

If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.

**Use of Web Beacons or GIF Files**

The owners and publishers of http://insuredprofits.com may include Web Beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Some Web Beacons may be placed by third-party service providers to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail communications. These Web Beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer, for the benefit of Insured Profits. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or e-mails and compiles anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and e-mails bring you to our website and how you use the site. Insured Profits prohibits Web Beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
