# Privacy Policy - Inside Retail

The following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the Octomedia website, www.insideretail.com.

Octomedia is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience. Octomedia is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Crh), which sets out a number of principles concerning the privacy of individuals.

**Collection of your personal information**

There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information, however, for access to future Octomedia customer support features you are required to submit personally identifiable information. This may include but is  not limited to a unique username and password, or provide sensitive information in the recovery of your lost password.

**Sharing of your personal information**

We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. Octomedia takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.

**Use of your personal information**

For each visitor to reach the site, we expressively collect the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the Site, page access times and referring website address. This collected information is used solely internally for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic, trends and delivering personalized content to you while you are at this Site.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward will adhere to our updated practices.

We use personal information you provide only for purposes consistent with the reason you provided it, or for a directly related purpose.

In addition, if you provide any personally identifiable information via an advertiser promotion, please be aware you are directly providing your personally identifiable information to that advertiser.

Generally, we will not use your personal information to market to you  unless we have either your implied or express consent but in situations where it is impractical to obtain your prior consent, we will ensure you have an ability to opt out of future such communications.

We may from time to time use your personal information to send relevant marketing messages from third parties, however, we will ensure you have an ability to opt out of future such communications.

General Conference/Event Privacy Notice. In registering for a conference or event that we manage, relevant details will be incorporated into a delegate list for the benefit of all delegates (name and organisation only), and may be made available to parties directly related to the conference including Octomedia, the client, venues and accommodation providers (for the purpose of room bookings and conference options), key sponsors (subject to strict conditions) and parties associated with relevant conferences. Should you not wish for your details to be passed on for the above purposes, email the relevant conference email address (found on the online registration page) or subs@octomedia.com.au. Please be aware that photos will be taken at events and provided to the conference client and these may be used for promotion purposes digitally or on print mediums.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Octomedia reserves the right to make amendments to this Privacy Policy at any time. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site.

**Accessing Your Personal Information**

You have a right to access your personal information, subject to exceptions allowed by law. If you would like to do so, please let us know.
