# Instructables - Privacy Policy

It is the policy of Instructables, Inc. ("Instructables") to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact us at info at Instructables dot com.

### Website Visitors

Instructables collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Instructables' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Instructables' visitors use its website. From time to time, Instructables may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Instructables also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Instructables only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of Instructables.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Instructables' websites choose to interact with Instructables in ways that require Instructables to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Instructables gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a membership at our site to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Instructables – by purchasing a pro membership, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Instructables collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Instructables. Instructables does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

nstructables may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Instructables may monitor the most popular projects on our site. Instructables may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Instructables does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Instructables discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Instructables' behalf or to provide services available at Instructables' websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Instructables website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. 

Instructables will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone for their own direct marketing purposes without your consent. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Instructables discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law (such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request), or when Instructables believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Instructables, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Instructables website and have supplied your email address, Instructables may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Instructables and our products. We may also send you email when certain actions take place on our site (for example when another user sends you a private message, when someone leaves a comment for you, or when someone you subscribe to publishes or changes something); [you can change or opt out of these emails here](https://web.archive.org/you/watchlist?modify=WATCHLIST). If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Instructables takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Business Transfers

If Instructables, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Instructables goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Instructables may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Cookies

Instructables uses cookies to help Instructables identify and track visitors, their usage of Instructables website, and their website access preferences. Instructables visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Instructables website, with the drawback that certain features of Instructables' websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Ads

Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Instructables and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.
