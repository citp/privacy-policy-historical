We may also share the information we have collected when a User agrees to receive information from third parties (e.g., by choosing to "opt-in" to such communications). If a User is presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties, and consents to receiving such information, Prolific Works is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, a User should review those privacy policies and practices prior to agreeing to share their Personal Information.

Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without User consent. 

Our Site, Prolific Works content sharing platform, and Services contain links to, and allow you to share content on, third party websites and services. The fact that we link to a website or service or allow you to share content on them is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This privacy policy applies only as provided in the scope section above. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
