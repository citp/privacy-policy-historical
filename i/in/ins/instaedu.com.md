# Privacy policy - InstaEDU

## Effective 11/27/2012

InstaEDU, Inc. (" **InstaEDU** ", " **our** ", " **us** " or " **we** ") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.instaedu.com (the " **Site** "). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our InstaEDU Terms of Service, accessible at [instaedu.com/tos/](http://instaedu.com/tos/).

As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

## Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content (together, the " **Services** ") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.

_Personally Identifiable Information._

  * In the course of using the Site and Services (e.g., in connection with your registration as a User or Tutor), we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (" **Personal Information** "). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, credit card or other billing information and email address. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.
  * You can register to join the Service as a User or Tutor by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites (“ **SNS** ”) (including, but not limited, to Facebook) via our Site. When you register by logging into an SNS via our Site, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, profile picture, email address, list of SNS friends and other information you make available via the applicable SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that information to create your account; the information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. If you choose to register as a User to use the Services, you may also register to create an account directly via the Site without logging into an SNS.
  * We also collect the other information that you provide as part of your use of the Site and Services (e.g., school, academic major and area of academic interest) (" **Non-Identifying Information** "). If you register to use the Services as a Tutor, we will also collect related information including, but not limited to, your academic year and a description of your tutoring services and interests. .
  * If you register to use the Services as a Tutor, our third party service providers will collect certain information, such as your name and email address, from you to enable us to make payments to you in connection with your activities on the Site and Services.
  * We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.
  * Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other InstaEDU Visitors (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used.
  * We also use your Personal Information to contact you with InstaEDU newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See " **Changing or Deleting Information** ," below.)



_Log Data._ When you visit the Site, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an " **InstaEDU Visitor** "), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (" **Log Data** "). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (" **IP** ") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Services and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. 

## Cookies

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by InstaEDU Visitors and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. 

## Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to InstaEDU. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

## Invite a Friend

If you choose to invite a friend to use the Site and Services, we may collect the email address of such friend for the purpose of sending a one-time email invitation to use the Site and Services. We will not use the email address for any other purposes. Your friend may request that we delete his or her email address from our records by contacting us at [support@instaedu.com](mailto:support@instaedu.com).

These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. 

_Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement._ InstaEDU cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
