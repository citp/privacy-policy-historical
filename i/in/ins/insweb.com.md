Please note that it will take up to 10 days to process your request.

**_What do sites that have links from InsWeb do with my information?_**

    Please be aware that Websites that have links on our site may collect personal information about you. When you click on one of these links, you are being transferred to another Website. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these linked sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of Websites linked to the InsWeb site.

**_What is framing?_**

    Framing is a term used to describe the way a web page is presented. When InsWeb presents you with a "framed" web page, you will see InsWeb's branding elements alongside the branding elements of the non-affiliated third party with which InsWeb has contracted to provide a particular insurance product, set of services and/or particular set of web pages. Although InsWeb does incorporate framing in order to provide you with more products and services, you will always be notified before leaving the InsWeb site. And while you may still see InsWeb's URL in the address line, the framed site and not InsWeb will collect all personally identifiable information you enter. We encourage you to read the privacy statement on a framed page carefully as this privacy statement may differ in substance from InsWeb's privacy statement.

**_How does InsWeb protect my information as it passes over the Internet?_**

    With SSL, when you enter a request for quotes or provide personal information, your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our computer servers. To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser. We recommend using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser. Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher are 128-bit browsers. You can tell when you are visiting a secure area in our site by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen. If you are using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see either a lock or a key. When the symbol appears unbroken or the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server. 

When you agree to send information, we transmit your information to the company you select. We offer encryption to each of our participating insurance companies. We require encryption when transmitting information such as Social Security numbers or credit card information. 

**_Does InsWeb use "cookies"?_**

    Cookies are small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. InsWeb uses cookies to help make it easier for returning users to log in and complete one of our quote forms. While our use of cookies should make your online experience easier, it is our policy not to use cookies to track, collect, or store your personally identifiable information. If you feel uncomfortable accepting cookies, you can change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being saved to your hard drive. 

InsWeb also contracts with certain partners that utilize ad-serving technology offered by various companies. To gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements, these companies may place a cookie on your computer when you view Web pages where these ads appear, or when you click on the ads. These third-party cookies enable the companies to recognize certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's IP address, browser version type, operating system, Internet service provider, and time zone. The collection of this aggregated user information helps our partners improve the effectiveness of InsWeb's advertising by delivering ads that they believe will be of most interest to you, and minimize the repetition of ads you see. Although the information collected using these cookies does not directly recognize your personally identifiable information, these third parties may be able to associate the cookie information with your personally identifiable information if you registered for a product or service on their site. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these third party sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

**_Does InsWeb use Web beacons?_**

    Some pages on our Site, as well as pages where our banner ads appear, and certain emails we send, may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, or single-pixel GIFs. These Web beacons collect certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. Our partners use Web beacons to compile aggregated statistics that help us improve the effectiveness of our advertising and make our Site easier to use. The information collected using these Web beacons does not identify individual users of our Site. 

**_Does InsWeb log my movements?_**

    InsWeb logs both consumer movements through our site and consumer search requests. This data is used to analyze trends, gather demographic information for aggregate use, and help administer the site. We do not use these technologies to capture or share your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you. 

Each time you visit our site, we may detect the type of operating system, Internet browser, and email client you use (program for accessing emails). This allows us to notify you of potential problems with our applications and certain operating system Internet browser combinations. Determining the email client in use lets us send communications that are compatible with your system. 

**_Does InsWeb collect information from children under the age of 13?_**

    InsWeb does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children.
