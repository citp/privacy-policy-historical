### Questions and Answers about InsWeb's Privacy Policy

**_How does InsWeb use my personally identifiable information?_**

    We use your personally identifiable information to create your insurance profile. From this profile, we generate instant online quotes (as available) using the rating methods of our participating insurance companies. If you meet their criteria, participating insurance companies who don't yet offer online quotes may provide an offline quote. 

Unless you give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we do not willfully use or disclose personally identifiable information. However, we may share: 1) site usage activity; and 2) aggregated statistical information from our database with our participating insurance companies or business partners (for example, the percentage of our users that are male). Even in these cases, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed. 

In addition, InsWeb will not willfully disclose personally identifiable information obtained from those: 1) utilizing InsWeb's Live Help feature; 2) submitting a resume electronically through [Jobs@InsWeb](mailto:Jobs@InsWeb); and 3) completing an on-line application for our Associates Program. Requests for corporate information via InsWeb's Materials Request application will be sent directly to Shareholder.com. This privacy policy does not cover the information practices of Shareholder.com.

**_How do InsWeb's participating insurance companies use my information?_**

    We do not control the privacy practices of the participating insurance companies; however, all the companies use the information you provide for one general purpose: to provide you with an accurate insurance quote. Companies use your personally identifiable information in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs. However, rating criteria may be different for each participating insurance company and each company may place different emphasis on particular aspects of your information. 

**_Do you send my information to an insurance company? Do I have control over this?_**

    Yes, you always have total control over whether InsWeb sends your personally identifiable information to insurance companies, and to which companies this information is sent. To request coverage from a company that has offered an online quote, or to request an offline quote, you can choose to send your name, contact information, and the detailed information you provided on the quote request form to one or more insurance companies. In any case, this information is only sent at your direction. 

**_Why do some of InsWeb's quote request forms require so much information?_**

    We work with many insurance companies. Since these companies use different criteria to rate prospective customers, the form must encompass a wide range of questions. Asking lots of questions ensures that you receive the largest number of quotes possible. If you decline to provide some requested information, we may be unable to provide quotes from some companies. 

**_How can I change my information?_**

    At any point while shopping for quotes, you can use the tabs found across the top of the page to return to previous pages. To change the information displayed, type the new data in the form and click the **Continue** or **Submit** button found on the page. When you save your information to an InsWeb Account you can return any time you like to change the information. Simply log in on the site and you will have access to the personal information you entered. To change the information displayed, type the new data in the form and click the **Continue** or **Submit** button found on the page. 

**_How do I access my information?_**

    Select the **Returning to InsWeb** option on the first page of the quote request form or log in from our home page. After you enter your user name and password, you can view the form containing the information you entered earlier. 

**_After I request quotes at InsWeb, who will contact me?_**

    Representatives of the companies you choose will contact you with information regarding your quotes, coverages, or insurance needs. These representatives will only contact you if you specifically authorize it. (For more information, refer to the privacy and information sharing practices of InsWeb Insurance Services and Goldrush Insurance Services below.) 

In addition to InsWeb e-mailing a quote confirmation and coverage follow-up reminder (when necessary), InsWeb will occasionally e-mail a quality control survey to all customers who request quotes or coverage. These surveys are optional. While we may review individual survey responses as well as the aggregated results, none of the surveys are associated with personally identifiable information. Additionally, InsWeb does not disclose or share survey responses with any third party. 

**_Does InsWeb sell my information to other companies?_**

    No, we never resell, trade, lease or rent our users' personally identifiable information to other companies. 

**_Does InsWeb store my information?_**

    Yes. All information submitted through our quote request forms is stored on our computer servers. We do not use your personally identifiable information except to process your request to provide quotes, or with your permission: 

  * to forward it to an insurance company when you request coverage, 
  * to save it to your InsWeb Account, and 
  * to send you e-mail. 



**_Does InsWeb allow me to correct the information?_**

    Yes. You can change the information you provide to us at any time. Your right to review and correct information provided by third parties, such as credit reports, is subject to a variety of federal and state laws. 

**_Does InsWeb send e-mails, and can I opt out?_**

    When you save your information at our site you will be given the opportunity to receive further information from InsWeb. Our communications are usually delivered to our customers via e-mail. Your e-mail address may be provided to a trustworthy third party solely for this purpose. Our customers generally find the information helpful. You can choose not to receive this information by: 

  * Responding to the opt-out question when you save your data, 
  * Following the instructions in the e-mail message you receive, 
  * Clicking on **Contact Us** at the bottom of any InsWeb page, 
  * Sending an e-mail to [customercare@insweb.com](mailto:customercare@insweb.com) or 
  * Calling 1-800-871-5075. 



If you have completed the quote information page by entering your contact information, you will occasionally receive information from us about your quotes (although you may not have saved your information). 

**_What do sites that have links from InsWeb do with my information?_**

    Please be aware that Web sites that have links on our site may collect personal information about you. When you click on one of these links, you are moving to another website. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these linked sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of Web sites linked to the InsWeb site.

**_What is framing?_**

    Framing is a term used to describe the way a web page is presented. When InsWeb presents you with a "framed" web page, you will see InsWeb's branding elements alongside the branding elements of the non-affiliated third party with which InsWeb has contracted to provide a particular insurance product, set of services and/or particular set of web pages. Although InsWeb does incorporate framing in order to provide you with more products and services, you will always be notified before leaving the InsWeb site. And while you may still see InsWeb's URL in the address line, the framed site and not InsWeb will collect all personally identifiable information you enter. We encourage you to read the privacy policy on a framed page carefully as this privacy policy may differ in substance from InsWeb's privacy policy. 

**_How does InsWeb protect my information as it passes over the Internet?_**

    With SSL, when you enter a request for quotes or provide personal information, your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our computer servers. To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser. We recommend using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser. Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher are 128-bit browsers. You can tell when you are visiting a secure area in our site by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen. If you are using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see either a lock or a key. When the symbol appears unbroken or the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server. 

When you agree to send information, we transmit your information to the company you select. We offer encryption to each of our participating insurance companies. We require encryption when transmitting information such as Social Security numbers or credit card information. 

**_Does InsWeb use "cookies"?_**

    Cookies are small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. InsWeb uses cookies to help make it easier for returning users to log in and complete one of our quote forms. While our use of cookies should make your online experience easier, it is our policy not to use cookies to track, collect, or store your personally identifiable information. If you feel uncomfortable accepting cookies, you can change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being saved to your hard drive. 

InsWeb also contracts with certain partners that utilize ad-serving technology offered by various companies. To gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements, these companies may place a cookie on your computer when you view Web pages where these ads appear, or when you click on the ads. These third-party cookies enable the companies to recognize certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's IP address, browser version type, operating system, Internet service provider, and time zone. The collection of this aggregated user information helps our partners improve the effectiveness of InsWeb's advertising by delivering ads that they believe will be of most interest to you, and minimize the repetition of ads you see. Although the information collected using these cookies does not directly recognize your personally identifiable information, these third parties may be able to associate the cookie information with your personally identifiable information if you registered for a product or service on their site. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these third party sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

**_Does InsWeb use Web beacons?_**

    Some pages on our Site, as well as pages where our banner ads appear, and certain emails we send, may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, or single-pixel GIFs. These Web beacons collect certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. Our partners use Web beacons to compile aggregated statistics that help us improve the effectiveness of our advertising and make our Site easier to use. The information collected using these Web beacons does not identify individual users of our Site. 

**_Does InsWeb log my movements?_**

    InsWeb logs both consumer movements through our site and consumer search requests. This data is used to analyze trends, gather demographic information for aggregate use, and help administer the site. We do not use these technologies to capture or share your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you. 

Each time you visit our site, we many detect the type of operating system, Internet browser, and email client you use (program for accessing emails). This allows us to notify you of potential problems with our applications and certain operating system Internet browser combinations. Determining the email client in use lets us send communications that are compatible with your system. 

**_Does InsWeb collect information from children under the age of 13?_**

    InsWeb does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children.
