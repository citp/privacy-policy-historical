There are occasions when I will ask for personal information, such as when you enter a contest. In these cases, I will only collect personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) that you voluntarily provide through my Website or via email correspondence.

I will not sell or exchange your personal information at any time. I will collect general information (such as the type of browser you use, the files you request, and the domain name and country from which you request information) to improve my Website and better meet your needs.

Before I collect any personally identifiable information, I will provide an explanation for the possible use of your data. For example, the information you supply might be used by Inspired Reads to respond to your inquiries or supply you with requested information. It may be necessary, if required by law or if pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations, to release your personally identifiable information. If you have submitted personal information to me electronically and would like it removed or modified, please contact me. I will use every possible reasonable effort to comply with your request.
