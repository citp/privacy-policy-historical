<p><strong>Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Insurance.com, a website owned by QuinStreet, Inc. We at  QuinStreet, Inc. and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to  respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate  protection and management of any information you share with us by using  our web sites.</p>
<p>QuinStreet has established the following Online Privacy Policy so  that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your  information. This policy describes the overall privacy practices of  QuinStreet regarding information we collect on our network of web sites  and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not  limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy also  describes the specific privacy practices regarding information you  voluntarily disclose while taking advantage of the insurance-quoting  services on <a href="http://www.insurance.com/"><span style="color: #800080;">www.insurance.com</span></a>, <a href="http://www.comparisonmarket.com/">www.comparisonmarket.com</a> and <a href="http://www.carinsurance.com/"><span style="color: #800080;">www.carinsurance.com</span></a>,  which we provide through our wholly owned subsidiary, QuinStreet Insurance Agency, Inc. (fka Car Insurance.com, Inc.). This policy does not apply to the practices of  companies that QuinStreet does not own or control, or to people that  QuinStreet does not employ.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>California has passed legislation requiring certain specific  disclosures be made available to California residents who use the  Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing  purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a  customer’s personal information (as defined by the act) to any third  party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for  obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of  anyone who might have received that personal information.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident you may request this information  from QuinStreet or any of its affiliates by writing to us via email at  info@quinstreet.com or you may send us correspondence at the following  address: QuinStreet, Attn: Privacy, 950 Tower Lane, 6th Floor, Foster  City, CA 94404. QuinStreet is not obligated to respond to more than one  such request from a customer per calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by QuinStreet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong></p>
<p>QuinStreet collects various types of information from you to better  meet your needs and to provide you with a more relevant user experience.  Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (a  small text file placed on your computer which can identify your  operating system and session ID) or other Internet tracking  technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session  may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using,  your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP  address and the URL you saw just before coming to the QuinStreet site,  the pages of the site you visited and the URL of the page you visited  upon leaving the site. If you take advantage of our insurance-quoting  services, we may also use web beacons, which allow our partners to place  a cookie on an end user’s computer when they visit one of our partner  sites so that when the end user visits our sites, that cookie data is  tracked by our partner and our partner can identify that the end user  achieved a certain milestone (a commonly used concept also referred to  as “pixel tracking”).</p>
<p>QuinStreet may also contract with reputable third-party advertising  companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use  cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally identifiable  information. We have no access to or control over these cookies, and  this policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong></p>
<p>In addition, at some of the QuinStreet web sites, we collect  information that you may choose to provide to us when requesting  additional information from us or from one or more of our clients.  Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us  include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally  identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have your information  deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than  for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth  below.</p>
<p>Where you provide your personal information to us to receive an auto  insurance quote, this information may include phone number, social  security number, marital status, date of birth, gender, occupation,  education level, driver’s license number, prior insurance coverage,  vehicle identification number (VIN), make, model and number of vehicles  on your household.</p>
<p><strong>How Collected Information is Used</strong></p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable information that QuinStreet collects  is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements  and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant  experience. The information is also used to predict responses to  advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which  content is most appropriate for different individuals. If you take  advantage of our insurance-quoting services, we may also provide  non-personally identifiable information about your use of our websites  to quoting aggregators, participating insurance carriers and our  business partners.</p>
<p>If you elect to provide QuinStreet with personally identifiable  information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and  this use may result in follow-up communications from QuinStreet and  from our clients. In addition, that information may be combined with  information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to  your preferences and behaviors, and for other QuinStreet sales and  marketing efforts.</p>
<p>If you provide your personal information to us to receive an auto  insurance quote, we may utilize such information for the following  purposes:</p>

<p>Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of QuinStreet on an anonymous basis.</p>
<p>When you request information from QuinStreet or one or more of our  clients, we may transfer that information within QuinStreet or route  your information to our client(s), across borders and from your country  or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so  that they may provide the information on their product or service that  you requested.</p>
<p>We may also disclose information to a third party who provides  substantially similar services as the original service about which you  requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with  an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that  QuinStreet is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does  business.</p>
<p>In addition to the above situations where your information may be  shared with others, there is also the possibility that QuinStreet, or  part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with,  another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or  merging) company will have access to all collected personally  identifiable information.</p>

<li>Implementing Change Request. We will use reasonable efforts to make  the changes you requested but it is not always possible to modify  database information. In addition, if your personal information and  email address has been provided to third parties, we will not be able to  make changes to it. Further, such information is never completely  removed from our database due to technical constraints and the fact that  we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of  your personal information would be removed from our database in response  to your request.</li>
<li>Live Chat. We provide a live chat feature on our Sites. When used  during business hours, this feature does not collect any personally  identifiable information. When used after business hours to send us a  message, this feature collects your name and email address. We use this  information to communicate with you regarding your inquiry. </li>

<p><strong>Other Matters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Third Party Links</strong></p>
<p>In some states, or for certain lines of coverage (including, but not  limited to, homeowners or renters coverage, certain health coverage,  life coverage, auto coverage) we may provide direct links to insurance  company or agency web sites if we cannot obtain comparative quote  information. If you purchase insurance from these third party carriers  as a result of visiting our sites the carrier may share your personal  information with us regarding the policy which is purchased and related  information but we will not share the information with unaffiliated  third parties. Please Note: when you purchase third party products  and/or services from third party web sites, you become their customer  and are subject to their privacy policies. Please be aware that we are  not responsible for third party privacy practices even if our name or  logos appear on third party sites. We encourage you to review these  companies' privacy policies and only do business with those who adhere  to personal information practices with which you are comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Share Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information or email  address that you provide in requesting an auto insurance quote with  third parties for their promotional purposes. However, we may use the  information to direct traffic to approved partner sites. If that  practice were to change, we would offer you the means to opt out of this  type of information sharing.</p>
