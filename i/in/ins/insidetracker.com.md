This Privacy Policy governs the way in which we collect, use, maintain, and disclose information collected from users of our websites. These websites may include but are not limited to [www.insidetracker.com](https://www.insidetracker.com/), and any other website or mobile application owned or operated by InsideTracker (the "Platform"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Platform and all products and services (collectively, the "Services") offered by us. We are committed to providing you a secure, user-controlled Platform. At the same time, you share responsibility for maintaining privacy and security. For example, we ask you to keep your password secure. Do not share it with any third parties. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

The Policy applies to all new and existing InsideTracker users. To use the InsideTracker Services, you must agree to the Privacy Policy. You may not use the Services if you do not agree to the Privacy Policy because it is part of the Terms of Service ("Terms"). Any capitalized terms not defined in the Privacy Policy have the same meaning as those in the Terms. 

Our Terms of Service explains that, by using our Platform and signing up for services provided by InsideTracker or on our behalf by third parties with whom we contract, you are allowing us to collect, use and process your Personal Information, Blood Information and Genetic Information according to the Terms, the Product Consent and this Privacy Policy.

By voluntarily giving us Personal Information and agreeing to have partner companies transmit your blood data and/or your genetic data to us, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Product Consent. If you give Personal Information to us, you agree that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of InsideTracker and third parties we authorize. 

## Privacy Principles

We follow the principles listed below to protect your privacy 

  * We do not collect any more Personal Information about you than we need. 
  * We only use your Personal Information for the purposes we specify in this Privacy Policy, unless you agree otherwise. 
  * Other than as we specify in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties. 



## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

  * Personal Information (Data). InsideTracker collects several types of Personal Information. Personal Information is data that could be used to identify you, either alone or when combined with other information. We gather this information from you when you buy our Services, subscribe to our newsletters, and use the Platform. You will also provide such information when you create a personal account and complete surveys and forms. When you communicate with us or request information from us we will collect Personal Information from you. Personal Information collected online can be combined with Personal Information collected offline. The Personal Information we collect may include your name, email address, mailing address, date of birth, gender, and credit card or bank account information. If you buy our InsideTracker service we will also collect certain health, test, and biometric information, including, but not limited to, blood biomarker data, height, weight, ethnicity, and heart rate. If you buy the InsideTracker genetics service, we will also collect certain DNA (Genetic) information. Personal information may include registration information, blood biomarkers information, DNA information, self-reported information, user content and web behavior information. 
  *     * Registration Information is information that we collect from you when you register for InsideTracker Services. Examples include your name, age, login credentials, and contact information, such as an email address. We use this information to deliver our Services to you, to communicate with you, and to confirm your identity. 
    * Blood biomarker data is data related to your blood test results from tests done by InsideTracker laboratory partners. You may also upload existing blood test results from tests ordered by your doctor or insurance company. We may use your blood biomarker data in a de-identified, aggregated way for InsideTracker research. 
    * Genetic (DNA) information is data related to your genotype for a specific set of genes related to healthy aging, nutrition, weight, sleep and physical activity. InsideTracker will receive your genetic information from our partner Helix when you buy the GoalGetter product. When you purchase the InsideTracker DNA kit, you will collect a DNA sample using the provided collection kit and send it to our partner AKESOgen for DNA extraction and analysis. If you purchase our genetics add-on service, you will provide your genetic data from DNA tests that you have previously had done. InsideTracker analyzes your DNA data using an algorithm that determines your genetic potential for certain traits. InsideTracker may use your aggregated, de-identified genetic data for research and development to improve future products. For research that we hope to publish in scientific publications, we will request separate permission through a Research Consent document to use your de-identified Genetic Information. Any Research Consent is optional and voluntary. You will not be required to agree to a Research Consent document in order to use the Platform or Services. 
    * Self-Reported Information includes information you provide in the InsideTracker questionnaire or in any other website surveys or forms, such as sex, body weight, height, diet, etc. We may use your Self-Reported Information in a de-identified way for InsideTracker research. 
    * User Content is all information other than Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information provided by the users of the InsideTracker Services and transmitted, whether publicly or privately, to InsideTracker. User content may include data, text, software, music, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other materials. For example, user content includes comments made on InsideTracker blogs and emails to customer support. 
    * Web Behavior Information is information on how you use the Platform (e.g. browser type, domains, page views). We may collect this information through log files, cookies, and web beacon, analytical and advertising technologies. 



If you have purchased InsideTracker as a gift for someone else, any information you provide about the gift recipient will be used only as needed to deliver the gift. Your gift recipient must create their own account. The gift recipient also must provide their own blood and genetic samples or data depending on the InsideTracker plan selected. The gift recipient must provide their own consent. No one else can consent for them. InsideTracker will not share any Personal Information of the gift recipient with you. 

You can always refuse to supply the Personal Information that we request. If you do refuse to supply information, you may not be able to engage in certain Platform-related activities and receive certain Services and information. 

  * Non-Personal Information. We may collect non-Personal Information about you when you interact with our Platform. Non-Personal Information may include your browser name, type of computer, and the files you viewed on the Platform. Clickstream data, (i.e. a list of pages or URLs visited), and technical information about how you connect to the Platform, such as the operating system and the internet service providers used, are other types of non-Personal Information that we may collect. We may, in some cases, need to review this automatically collected data in combination with specific registration information to identify and resolve issues for individual users, detect fraud, etc. To the extent that we link this non-Personal Information with your Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs our use of such information. 
  * Electronic Health Records Disclaimer. At no time shall your Personal Information, including blood data or genetic data collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy be deemed to be an electronic health record or an electronic medical record for any purpose, including without limitation for purpose of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

InsideTracker research is intended to advance wellness and nutrition knowledge and to create, commercialize, or undertake activities toward the practical applications of this learning to the improvement of health care. Our research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support medical research or conduct or support the development of drugs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions. We may ask permission to use your de-identified Genetic Information for research that we hope to publish in scientific publications. If you choose to give this permission, you will agree to a Research Consent document. The [Research Consent](https://www.insidetracker.com/research-consent/) document is optional and voluntary. You may use the website or services without agreeing to the Research Consent document. 



## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We have adopted generally accepted industry standards for our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your Personal Information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on the Platform. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is also your responsibility. We ask you to safeguard your password, secret questions and answers, and other authentication information you use to access our services. You should not disclose your authentication information to any third party. You should also immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password. We cannot secure Personal Information that you release on your own or that you request us to release. 

In addition, you may choose to disclose, through other means not associated with us, any part of your Personal Information and/or Genetic Information. You may share this information with friends or family members, groups of individuals, third-party service providers, doctors or other health care professionals, or other individuals. We recommend that you make such choices carefully. 

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) says that you are not required to share your genetic information with your employer or your health insurance company. Other companies, such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, and disability insurance companies, may ask you to share your genetic information. Always be careful with whom you choose to share your genetic information as it is your ultimate right and choice to share such information. 

If you do choose to share genetic data with your doctor or other health professional, those genetic data may become part of your medical record. Other health professionals and health insurance companies may be able to access the genetic data in your health record. 

We will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information and/or Genetic Information with a third party. It is your responsibility to share Personal Information and Genetic Information only with people you know and trust. 

We reserve the right to update our privacy and security policies and practices from time to time at our sole discretion. We will employ commercially reasonable technical and organizational safeguards against unauthorized disclosure or access to your data or other personally identifiable information about you, consistent with our Privacy Policy. HOWEVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SECURITY SAFEGUARDS, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE CAPABLE OF CIRCUMVENTION AND INSIDETRACKER DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WILL NOT BE ACCESSED BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS CAPABLE OF OVERCOMING SUCH SAFEGUARDS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR PLATFORM MAY BE USED TO ACCESS AND TRANSFER INFORMATION, INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU OVER THE INTERNET. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INSIDETRACKER DOES NOT OPERATE OR CONTROL THE INTERNET AND THAT UNAUTHORIZED USERS (SUCH AS HACKERS) MAY USE VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, KEYSTROKE LOGGERS AND OTHER UNDESIRABLE DATA AND SOFTWARE TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO OR DAMAGE OUR SITE OR TO ACCESS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. Furthermore, we cannot be responsible for any personally identifiable information about you that you release on your own, or that you request or authorize us to release.
