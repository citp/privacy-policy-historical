    <h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED | <a href="#top">Return to Top</a></h2>
    <p>
    The following are the types of information we may collect: 
    </p>

    <a name="p2"></a>
    <h3>Web Site Usage Information &amp; Device Identifiers</h3>
    <p>
    We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information
    whenever you visit or interact with the Web Site. For example, we may
    collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type
    of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other similar
    information. We may also collect your IP address or some other unique
    identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as
    applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier").
    A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your
    computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet,
    and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may
    associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide.
    When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors
    arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of
    content you may find most relevant, and what type of visitors are
    interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.
    </p>

    <a name="p3"></a>
    <h3>Information You Provide Us</h3>
    <p>
    We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal
    information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify
    you personally, such as your name, e-mail address and physical address;
    and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar
    information. We may collect this information at various places and forms
    on the Web Site, including registration forms for newsletters and other
    e-mail communications, when you communicate or otherwise interact with
    us, when you submit information to us (whether or not the information is
    intended to be posted on the Web Site), or when you enter or participate
    in contests, sweepstakes, surveys or voting or when you purchase a product
    or service through the Web Site. Providing us with information about
    yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain
    information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of
    the Web Site's features. 
    </p>

    <a name="p4"></a>
    <h3>Information from Other Sources</h3>
    <p>
    We may receive information about you from other sources; for example,
    we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information
    regarding your possible interests, from third parties. We may use this
    information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to
    serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the
    information we receive from those other sources with information we collect
    through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to
    any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed
    by us at the time you provide your personal information. 
    </p>

    <a name="p5"></a>
    <h3>Send To A Friend</h3>
    <p>
    If you send a friend a communication from the Web Site, the information you
    provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time
    basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing
    purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.

    <h2>THIRD-PARTY AD SERVING &amp; AUDIENCE AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES | <a href="#top">Return to Top</a></h2>
    <p>
    The Web Site may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements
    on the Web Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic
    on the Web Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display
    advertisements based on your visits to the Web Site and other web sites
    you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements
    to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although
    advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the
    Web Site, the Web Site's third party ad network providers, the advertisers,
    the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and
    access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies
    enabled in your browser or they may otherwise have access to non-personal
    information. These third party cookies, are set to, among other things, help
    deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent
    you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research
    regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any
    images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in
    association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which
    enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
    Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's
    specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies
    to serve advertisements on the Web Site, you may wish to visit
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>,
    which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain
    third party ad servers we may use.
