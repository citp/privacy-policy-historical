		<h3>Personal identification information</h3>
		We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform, and Services. Users may visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.

If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

		<p>We retain Non-Personally Identifiable Information on the instaFreebie content sharing platform for up to five years. Any search strings we collect via the instaFreebie content sharing platform are converted into Non-Personally Identifiable Information, and the raw search data is stored on our server logs for up to 90 days.

If you prefer that we do not collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may opt out.
		</p>
		<p>When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to use your information for delivering relevant online advertisements. Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.

		<h3>How we protect your information</h3>
		<p>We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
		</p>
		<p>We restrict access to Personal Information to instaFreebie employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform, and Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.
		</p>

		</p>

		<h3>Minors</h3>
		We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform or Services are designed to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases.

		<h3>International Users</h3>
		The Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform, and Services are hosted in the United States. If you access the Site or Services from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform, or Services, you are transferring your Personal Information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.

		We do not knowingly share, sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others, except as described in this Privacy Policy or on the Site. For example, we may share personal information as follows:

		<ul>
			<li>in aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above;</li>
			<li>with service providers ("Service Providers") such as vendors and consultants who work with us for the operation of the Site or other service we offer and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us;</li>
			<li>when a User gives consent to do so including, and not limited to, if we notify a User through the Site that the information provided will be shared in a particular manner and a User provides such information;</li>
			<li>when we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or we believe in good faith that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants, or court orders;</li>

		</ul>

		<p>We may also share the information we have collected when a User agrees to receive information from third parties. A User may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties and, therefore, a User should review the privacy policies and practices of third parties prior to agreeing to share their personal information. If the User later decides that they no longer want to receive communication from a third party, they will need to contact that third party directly. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without User consent.
		</p>

		<p>Our Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform, and Services contain links to, and allow you to share content on, third party websites and services. The fact that we link to a website or service or allow you to share content on them is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This privacy policy applies only as provided in the scope section above. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
		</p>
