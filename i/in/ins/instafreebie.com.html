</p> <h3>
    Sharing your personal information
</h3> <p>
    We do not knowingly share, sell, trade, or rent Users' Personal Information to others, except as described in this Privacy Policy or on the Site. For example, we may share Personal Information as follows:
</p> <ul><li><p>
            in aggregated demographic information not linked to any Personal Information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted subsidiaries and affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above;
        </p></li> <li><p>
            with service providers ("<strong>Service Providers</strong>") such as contractors, vendors and consultants who work with us for the operation of the Site or other service we offer and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us (subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures);
        </p></li> <li><p>
            when a User gives consent to do so including, and not limited to, if we notify a User through the Site that the information provided will be shared in a manner and a User provides such information;
        </p></li> <li><p>
            when we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or we believe in good faith that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants, or court orders;
        </p></li> <li><p>
            to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Terms and Conditions, or our other policies or agreements
        </p></li> <li><p>
            if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Libboo, Inc.our customers or others; and
        </p></li> <li><p>
            relating to, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the business assets of Libboo, Inc.
        </p></li></ul> <p>
    We may also share the information we have collected when a User agrees to receive information from third parties (e.g., by choosing to "opt-in" to such communications). If a User is presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties, and consents to receiving such information, Prolific Works is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, a User should review those privacy policies and practices prior to agreeing to share their Personal Information. If the User later decides that they no longer want to receive communication from a third party, they will need to contact that third party directly. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without User consent.
</p> <p>
    Our Site, Prolific Works content sharing platform, and Services contain links to, and allow you to share content on, third party websites and services. The fact that we link to a website or service or allow you to share content on them is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This privacy policy applies only as provided in the scope section above. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
</p> <h3>
