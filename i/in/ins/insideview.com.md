# Privacy - InsideView

## 2) Information We Collect From Our Subscribers

**Information Our Subscribers Provide About Themselves or Their Business  
**Our primary goal in collecting personal information from subscribers of the InsideView Service is to provide them with a smooth and efficient experience while communicating with us and using InsideView. This allows us to provide customized services and features that are most likely to meet subscribers’ needs and that make their experience easier and quicker.

When an individual expresses an interest in obtaining information about InsideView or registering to use the Service, InsideView requires the individual to provide us with contact information such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address. InsideView may then use the contact information provided to reach the individual via email or phone.

When a subscriber purchases services, InsideView may require the subscriber to provide financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, payment/credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Service. InsideView may also ask for additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry.

**Payment Card Information  
**InsideView does not retain payment or credit card numbers. This information is passed on immediately to our payment card processing service, which is required to use this information only for the processing of each specific transaction.

Once registered for the Service, a subscriber is able to add companies to his or her watch lists and automated search agents. We will retrieve and share information of interest to a subscriber, such as noteworthy events, address, phone number, and names of contacts on the companies that the subscriber wishes to watch.

**Information Our Subscribers may Provide for the Lead Referral Program  
**If a subscriber chooses to use our lead referral service to refer a third party to our site, the subscriber must first ensure that his/her business partner has agreed to share their contact or other information with us. In this case, we will ask for the third party’s contact name, email address and phone number. We will use this information to contact the third party (example, via a one-time email or phone call) about becoming a subscriber of InsideView. InsideView stores this information for the sole purpose of following up on the lead and tracking the success of our referral program.

The third party may contact us to request that we remove his/her/its information from our lead referral contact list. See the [Contacting Us](http://www.insideview.com/privacy-policy/#contact) section of this Policy for contact details.

**Usage Data We Gather  
**We also receive and store certain types of information whenever an individual (subscriber or visitor) interacts with our Site. InsideView automatically receives and records information on its server logs from the individual’s browser including the individual’s IP address, browser type, date/time stamp, InsideView cookie information, the page(s) that the individual requested, internet service provider, operating system, clickstream data and the referring/exit pages. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and site functionality.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies  
**Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts or similar technologies

are used by InsideView and our analytics/service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

Cookies are small amounts of data sent to an individual’s browser from the InsideView Web servers and stored on the individual’s hard drive. InsideView uses cookies to deliver content specific to the individual’s interests and to keep track of user names and passwords during user sessions. An individual can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If an individual chooses not to accept cookies, his or her ability to use InsideView might be limited. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information.

Generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show

Our third party tracking utility companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), which they use in combination with their cookies. These beacons help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The use of clear gifs by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our subscribers’ personal information.

**Correspondence  
**If an individual corresponds with InsideView via email, or other method regarding his or her activities or postings on the Site, InsideView will treat that email or other correspondence as ordinary business correspondence and will retain it according to its standard corporate information retention policies.
