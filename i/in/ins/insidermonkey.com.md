# Privacy Policy - Insider Monkey

Insider Monkey gathers two types of data about our users: personal information and tracking information. Currently, we do not require users to become members of Insider Monkey in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on Insider Monkey. However, if you would like to receive one or more of our newsletters and certain services we require you to register to become a member. In order to register, you will have to supply us with your email address and choose a unique User Name and Password and fill out the registration form. Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites. This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using "cookies." A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. In addition to cookies placed by Insider Monkey or its agents, advertisers and third-party advertising vendors, including Google, that serve ads onto our web sites, and other third party partners may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies for advertising or other purposes. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors. Insider Monkey is the sole owner of the information collected on insidermonkey.com

Insider Monkey does not sell or disclose personal information about you described above to with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide you with products or services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or otherwise to cooperate with law enforcement agencies or state and federal regulators;
  * We provide the information to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies;
  * We provide the information on a confidential basis to nonaffiliated companies we engage as contractors or agents to perform services for us, such as maintaining software. Information will be shared with such contractors only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and pursuant to confidentiality obligations;
  * If we sell or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets related to any web site that we own or operate and any product or service that we offer. In that event, we will require such third party to honor our then-current Privacy Policy, until the third party provides you with notice of changes to our Privacy Policy and permits you to exercise any rights you may have under applicable law to limit disclosures of information about you;
  * We may disclose all the information we collect as described above to other companies such as direct marketers to perform marketing services on our behalf, or to third parties with whom we have joint marketing agreements; and
  * We may share with third parties certain pieces of _aggregated, non-personal information,_ such as the number of users who clicked on a particular link or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.



Whenever Insider Monkey changes its privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate.
