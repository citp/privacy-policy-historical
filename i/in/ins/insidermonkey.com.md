**Traffic Data:** We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Site; and (4) types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively “Traffic Data”). We store Traffic Data in our server logs when you access the website as part of standard server operation.

Additionally, to track possible security breaches we store your IP address in our database when you attempt to login to the website or try to download a paid newsletter.

**Data via Cookies:** A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. In addition to cookies placed by Insider Monkey or its agents, advertisers and third-party advertising vendors, including Google, that serve ads onto our websites, and other third party partners may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies for advertising or other purposes.

We use encrypted cookies to keep you signed in to our website and store your viewing preferences. Additionally our partners use cookies:
