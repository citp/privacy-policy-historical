**Links to Other Sites**  
If you visit a third party website that is linked from this Site, you should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information. We are not responsible for the practices of such third party websites, and a link to such website is not an endorsement by Millward Brown Digital of such website’s privacy practices, products or services.

**Reporting & Tracking Utilities**

_Log Files_  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information is related to the use of this Site and services and includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

_Cookies_  
We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of a web technology called a “cookie.” A cookie is a small text file that is saved to your computer using your web browser, which allows websites to recognize you and store preferences and other information if you return to the website using the same computer and browser.

We use cookies for website analytics purposes to collect information about how visitors use our site. We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You control how your internet browser processes and saves cookies by following directions provided in your browser’s “help” file.

You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Site. If you delete your cookies, change browsers or use a different device, our cookie (or an opt-out cookie) may no longer work and you will have to re-input (or opt-out) again.

_Web Beacons_  
Our third party analytics companies employ a software technology called Web Beacons. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used on this site to track the online movements of our site users. Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages. Web beacons may set cookies or interact with cookies on user’s computers.

We may use Web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the “Opt-out” section below. We utilize certain third-party tracking services that deploy web beacons (and cookies) to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics to improve our Site.

**Social Media**  
We use a number of social media tools to enhance visitor interaction on our site. If you already use these platforms their cookies may be set through our Site. Personally identifiable information which you voluntarily disclose online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or other open forum, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We may associate your name and website with your comments on our blog, but we are unable to control uses of your personally identifiable information by other users who see your information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.

**Opt-Out**  
If you no longer wish to receive email communications from Millward Brown Digital as described above, you may opt-out by following the directions that are included in each email communication. You may also contact us at [admin@millwardbrowndigital.com](mailto:admin@millwardbrowndigital.com) for assistance.

**Security**  
We have put in place reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to the information we collect. However, no security measures are 100% impenetrable and we cannot guarantee against all potential security breaches. Moreover, the transmission of information over the Internet is not inherently secure, and we are not responsible for the transmission of information over networks that we do not control. Your use of our Site demonstrates your assumption of these risks.

**Data Retention**  
We will retain the information described above for as long as the information has value as part of the services we offer, or as long as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, whichever is longer. If you wish to request that we no longer use your personally identifiable information to provide you services or information, please contact us at [admin@millwardbrowndigital.com](mailto:admin@millwardbrowndigital.com).

**Children Under 13 Year Old**  
This Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable data from or about any person under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old and wish to ask a question or use this site in any way which requires you to submit your personally identifiable information, please get your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf.

**Site and Service Updates**  
When necessary, we will send registered users site and service announcement updates. Registered users are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email.

**Correction/Updating Personally Identifiable Information**  
If you are a registered user, you can access and update your contact information by logging into your account. You may also request deactivation of your Millward Brown Digital account or any of your personally identifiable information held by us by sending an email to [admin@millwardbrowndigital.com](mailto:admin@millwardbrowndigital.com). If you choose to deactivate your account, we will retain in our files some personally identifiable information you have requested to remove to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce our Terms & Conditions, respect your opt-out preferences, and comply with legal requirements as permitted by law.

**Changes in this Privacy Policy**  
If we are going to use your previously collected personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated in our privacy policy at the time of collection, you will be notified via email if possible. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner and instructions for how to make that choice will be included in the notification. We will not use personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated in our privacy policy at the time of collection without notifying you.

If we make a material change to this policy, we will post a prominent notice on this site for 30 calendar days prior to the implementation of the material change and describe how individuals may exercise any applicable choice. Following the implementation of the material change, we will record at the introduction of this policy when the policy was last revised.
