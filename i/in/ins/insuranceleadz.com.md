## Glossary

**Cookie:** A small text file of information saved in the browser when you access certain Web pages. Cookies hold information that identifies you to the Web site (and only that Web site) that gave you the cookie.

**Internet protocol (IP) address** : The numbers that are translated into a domain name (e.g., InsuranceLister.com). The address is a string of four numbers separated by periods (such as 111.22.3.244) used to represent a computer or other device on the Internet.

**Operating system:** The program responsible for overseeing the basic hardware resources of a computer such as disk drives, memory, keyboard, screen, and CPU. UNIX, DOS, Windows, and Macintosh System 7 are examples of operating systems.

**Session ID:** The code used to keep track of a person (using a browser) as he or she interacts with a server. Since the server may interact with many people simultaneously, a session ID is needed to keep track of each person individually.

**Your privacy is important to us.**  
At InsuranceLeadz.com, we use the highest level of security available to safeguard your personal information. We hate spam just as much as you do, so we'll never sell or rent your email address for mass marketing.
