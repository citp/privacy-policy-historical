# InsideHook | Travel, News, Health & Fashion for Men in New York, LA & the Nation

Escapist Media Inc., the owner of InsideHook, appreciates your trust in letting us into your inbox, and as such takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. InsideHook’s goal is to provide you with relevant information tailored to your individual needs, while at the same time protecting the privacy you justifiably value. This privacy policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register for our daily email. Please be sure to read this notice carefully.

**Personal Information:** To receive your InsideHook emails, all we require is your email address. So that we may provide you with additional services and also content that is more interesting and relevant to you in particular, we may also request additional information such as your name, age, telephone number, or zip code. InsideHook does not collect any personally identifiable information that you do not expressly provide. InsideHook will never share your personal information, including your email address, with any third parties without your express permission, except in the case of delivering our email to you or as required by law. In cases where you grant express permission, InsideHook may share your email address with its sweepstakes marketing partners and prize providers for marketing purposes.

**Nonpersonal Information:** We may also request nonpersonally identifiable information, such as annual income, shopping preferences or age. This information is known as demographic and profile data, and is 100% optional. If you choose to share it, this data may be used to improve our site and/or tailor your experience, by delivering you content that we think might be of interest to you and displaying it according to your preferences. We may share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in InsideHook , but never on a personal level. This information would only be shared in aggregate, anonymous form, such as letting an advertiser know the average age of an InsideHook reader. No third party will ever receive information from us that personally identifies you or any other person in any way.

**Usage Information:** It is important for us to gather information on how our site is used in order to handle traffic and make sure our content reaches you in the most efficient manner possible. InsideHook may collect nonpersonal, aggregated information about subscribers’ use of our site, such as time spent on the site, which sites subscribers come from, and to what sites they might head next. Again, this information is in aggregate and anonymous form and is not personally identifiable – it will only be used to find out how subscribers use our service and site.

**Review and Access:** Upon your request, we will be happy to provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update or modify any of this information.

**Choice/Opt-Out:** If we ever send you information by email concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, InsideHook will provide you with an email address by which you may request no future notices.

**Third-Party Advertising:** Some of the ads appearing on our Web site may be delivered to you by our Web advertising partners. Information about your visit to a partner site or sites, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or any other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about our advertising partners, cookies, and how to opt out, please contact us at [contact@insidehook.com](mailto:contact@insidehook.com).

**Log Files:** Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. These include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.

**Tracking:** Like most other websites, InsideHook makes use of browser “cookies.” Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard disk by our server that allow us to quickly check your status as a subscriber and facilitate access to your preferences. InsideHook will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that is not related to our site or services. InsideHook also uses transparent GIF images to track the e-mails that we send out. If you do not want cookies, your browser most likely includes a setting in which they won’t be accepted.

**Third-Party Cookies:** In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Again, the acceptance or refusal of these cookies is in most cases manageable via your web browser settings.

**Links to Other Sites:** In our quest to bring you the most relevant, actionable content possible, InsideHook may create links allowing you to access third-party sites. InsideHook is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not necessarily endorse these sites. Please consult those sites’ individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.

**Security:** All information described above is stored on restricted database servers.

**Legal Disclaimer:** Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, InsideHook may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.

**Business Transitions:** In the event InsideHook goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

**Deletion of Account:** Should you ever decide to delete your InsideHook account, you may do so by unsubscribing. If you terminate your account, any association between your account and information InsideHook stores will no longer be accessible through your account.

**Modification to This Policy:** InsideHook reserves the right to modify this policy, but in the event we do so we will maintain complete transparency — any changes to the policy will be immediately posted here, so be sure to check back for future information.

**Contact Us:** If you have any questions about this policy or our site in general, please contact [contact@insidehook.com
