 **Personal Information:**  To receive your InsideHook emails, all we require is for you to provide your email address. So that we may provide you with additional services, contests, or sweepstakes, and also content that is more interesting and relevant to you in particular, we may also request additional information such as your name, age, telephone number, zip code, or other information required for the additional Services. We may also request certain information from you that is not required for use of the Services, such as annual income, shopping preferences or age. This information is known as demographic and profile data, and is 100% optional. If you choose to share it, this data may be used to improve our site and/or tailor your experience, by delivering you content that we think might be of interest to you and displaying it according to your preferences.

You may be asked to provide your name, mailing address and/or email address and date of birth, as well as certain other information on an optional basis, in order to participate in such sweepstakes or contest. This information may also be used by InsideHook or its third party partner to send you information about InsideHook’s or such third party partner’s services in the form of an email or regular mail communication or a telephone call. InsideHook will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications from InsideHook each time you receive such a communication.
