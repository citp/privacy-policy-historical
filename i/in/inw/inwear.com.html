<br>
<p>www.inwear.com uses one of the most secure online ordering systems on the market, and we are constantly researching and improving our software to make sure we offer the highest possible security at all times.</p>
<p>We utilise Security Socket Layer (SSL) technology; one of the most secure systems for ordering online that allows encryption of your potential sensitive information, such as your name and address and critical sensitive information such as credit card information. Your information will be encrypted from the moment you enter it, and your sensitive information will not be saved on a public server. That means that information passed between you and our Website cannot be read in the event someone else intercepts it. The SSL technology provides an authentication that assures your browser that your data is being sent to the correct secure computer server; an encryption that encodes all data, so only the secure server is able to read it; and a data integrity that checks that the transferred data has not been altered.</p>

<h2>Other websites</h2>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.</p>
