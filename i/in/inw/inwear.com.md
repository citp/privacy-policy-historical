Privacy

**InWear.com Privacy Statement  
** IC companys is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of the InWear.com site (the “Site”); it does not apply to other online or offline IC companys sites, products or services. By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested such as receiving information about IC Companys products and services, entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site or service, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing, downloading and/or registering IC Companys products. The personal information we collect may include your name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information about your job function, information about your company, and credit card information. 

The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

**Use of your Personal Information**  
The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.

In support of these uses, IC Companys may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related IC Companys products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with IC Companys, information collected by InWear.com may be combined with information collected by other IC Companys services.

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other IC Companys products and services.

When you sign up for a newsletter or agree to receive promotional e-mail, InWear.com may use customized links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. 

We may associate that information with your personal information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. 

Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication. Some services on InWear.com offer individuals the ability to publicly display certain personal information, such as for a IC Companys partner who wishes to publish contact information as part of offering a business service. Participation in such services is always optional. 

IC Companys occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

IC Companys may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on IC Companys or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of IC Companys and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of IC Companys employees or agents, users of IC Companys products or services, or members of the public. 

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in Denmark or any other country in which IC Companys or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**Control of your Personal Information**  
Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of IC Companys and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. 

Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to IC Companys in the context of other, separately operated, IC Companys products or services.
