5\. Automatic Collection of Information; Cookies and IP Addresses [ back to top ]

iNetVideo uses a feature of the visitor’s web browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identity to his/her computer. Cookies are files that the web browsers place on computer’s hard drive. Our cookies enable us to provide features such as welcoming the visitor by his name, saving his/her  Wish List, storing items in his/her Shopping Cart between visits, and setting up other preferences the visitor establishes during each visit to the website.

iNetVideo also uses cookies to help determine whether the visitor came to the website from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can be used to help save and retrieve usernames used on the website and provide information on past purchases. This is done for convenience and saves the visitor the trouble of re-entering information on every visit to the website. Cookies cannot be used by iNetVideo to retrieve any personal information about the visitor unless he/she has previously purchased from or registered with the iNetVideo website. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about the visitor from his/her computer unless such information was knowingly and willingly provided by him/her.

Every computer on the Internet is identified by a unique number called an IP address. If the visitor has a static IP address, he/she gets the same number each time she connects to the Internet. If the visitor has a dynamic IP address, a number is assigned from a pool of addresses maintained by his/her ISP (Internet Service Provider) on a first-come basis. iNetVideo only uses the visitor’s IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, to administer its Site, and to gather basic demographic information.

iNetVideo gives the visitor choices and control over the collection and use of his/her Personal Information. He/she can update his/her Personal Information or remove his/her email address from iNetVideo’s email list.

If the visitor has any question about the genuineness of an email he/she received that appears to be from iNetVideo, contact us at support@inetvideo.com and do not furnish any kind of personal information in response to that email until you receive a response from us.

The visitor can also choose to receive email communications such as iNetVideo’s list of releases, promotions, featured items and bulletins and other forms of communication.
