If required to complete a transaction, we might also request financial information including PayPal account or credit card numbers. You may modify the information you have provided at any time from within your personal control panel.

We use customer contact information to provide services and occasionally, provide information on our company. The customer’s contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. We use unique identifiers, such as login & password, to verify the user’s identity and as account numbers in our customer database system. We also use information in the aggregate to demonstrate, for example, the number of people registered with the company. Unless required to complete a transaction you have requested, or to perform maintenance on our site, we do not share personal identifying information with outside entities.
