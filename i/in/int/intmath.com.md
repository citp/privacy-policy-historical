# Privacy Policy

Interactive Mathematics does not sell or give away your personal information, ever. Your right to privacy is paramount.

The information that you provide (when leaving a comment or asking a question) stays with Interactive Mathematics. 

## Summary of Information Collected & Used 

IntMath may keep some, or possibly all, of the following information about visitors:

### All visitors 

Any information kept on general visitors is anonymous. That is, no names or emails or any other personally identifying information is known, or kept in relation to this class of information (anonymous and passive). 

  1. Pages visited in IntMath and squareCircleZ blog (via server logs)
  2. External referer site (where visitors came from)
  3. Activity while on certain pages (to improve usability and value of pages) 



This information is used only to improve the layout and usability of the sites, and a balance between effectiveness of advertising and usefulness of the articles.

The data logs, including Google Analytics information, are never shared with any other party, and never will be.

### IntMath Newsletter Subscribers 

The following personal information is kept to facilitate functioning of the Newsletter:

  1. Name (as provided by the user)
  2. Email address
  3. Country (as determined from IP address of the computer used by the subscriber)
  4. Type of visitor (either student, teacher, parent, retired) via self-nomination 
  5. Any comments, requests or suggestions made by the user when subscribing, or subsequently



This information is used to continuously improve the usefulness of the Newsletter to subscribers.

We also take note of the most popular stories in each Newsletter, via clicks to those stories, to evaluate the interest level of different types of articles with the aim of continuous improvement. 

The Newsletter subscribers list has never been shared with any other party, and never will be. 

## Email Privacy

Your email address is never displayed on Interactive Mathematics or on the associated [squareCircleZ](http://www.intmath.com/blog/) blog. Everyone hates spam!

## Cookies

Sometimes cookies are placed on your computer to improve the functionality of the site. A cookie is a small text file that sits in your browser's cache. For example, Interactive Mathematics conducts a poll from time to time and a cookie is used to remember your voting status (voted already, or not voted yet). These cookies will **not** store personal information about you and will **not** be used in a malacious way. They do not track where you've been on other sites.

The poll cookie is a persistent cookie, which means it will stay on your computer for a certain amount of time, then disappear.

There is also a mobile device cookie, which is set when visitors choose how to view the site with their mobile device (either mobile version or full version). 

## Third-party Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this website. These companies may use information ( **not** including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, including search engines, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This "behavioral advertisitng" is used by Google Adsense, which is used throughout the sites. 

If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/faq).

## Privacy policies of linked sites

Throughout IntMath and squareCircleZ there are links to other sites, including sponsored links, independent of IntMath. These sites will have their own Privacy Policies and users are encouraged to read those policies before sharing personal information on those sites. 

## Server hosting company's Privacy Policy 

IntMath is hosted on WiredTree servers in Chicago, USA. We strictly abide by their [Terms of Service](http://www.wiredtree.com/legal/tos.php) statement on Spam, which says in part:

> ### SPAM and Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE)
