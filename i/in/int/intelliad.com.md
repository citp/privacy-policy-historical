### 4\. Collected Data for Web Tracking

In the course of tracking, we collect and analyze some information for our web controlling. This information is transmitted by your browser.

### 5\. IP Address

The IP address is transmitted at every server request, so that the server knows where the corresponding answer needs to be sent. The IP address is provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) as soon as a user connects with the internet and the ISP can understand which IP address is assigned to which client at a certain time. As long as the IP address is stored, the identity of the user can theoretically be determined via the ISP. Therefore, we save the IP address in (anonymized) form and only use them to recognize the session, for geo-localization (until city –level) and for the defense of attacks. The IP address is deleted instantly so that the collected data are anonymous and the identification of the user’s identity via ISPs is no longer possible.
