<td style="padding:15px">
<p>Interest.com  takes your privacy seriously, and has published this Privacy Policy to explain  how Interest.com treats all information you may submit to www.interest.com, except that information  which is submitted pursuant to a sweepstakes entry. Refer to the Official Rules  and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for Interest.com's specific  policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes  entry. </p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable  Information</strong></p>
<p>Many of the features of www.interest.com are available to you without  your providing personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information  generally includes information that could be used to determine your identity,  such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and birth date.&nbsp; The following are certain situations in which  Interest.com may collect personally identifiable information from you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration for Newsletters and Sweepstakes.&nbsp; </strong>Interest.com collects personally  identifiable information from you if you register online for one of  Interest.com’s newsletters and when you enter Interest.com’s sweepstakes. When  you register online with Interest.com, Interest.com asks for personally  identifiable information like your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender,  ZIP code, occupation, industry, personal interests and other demographic  information. </li>
<li><strong>Use of Forums.&nbsp; </strong>If you  choose to transmit, submit or post information through Interest.com’s chat  rooms, bulletin boards or other forums (the “Forums”), Interest.com will  collect that information you provide.&nbsp;  Interest.com retains this information as necessary to resolve disputes,  provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and  pursuant to Interest.com’s Terms of Use.</li>
<li><strong>Forms.</strong>&nbsp;  Interest.com may collect personally identifiable information from you if  you choose to fill out any forms, profiles, or surveys on www.interest.com.</li>
<li><strong>Correspondence.&nbsp; </strong>If you send Interest.com personal correspondence, such as  emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send Interest.com  correspondence about your activities or postings on www.interest.com,  Interest.com may choose to collect such information into a file specific to  you.</li>
<li><strong>Business Partners. </strong>Interest.com may receive  your personally identifiable information from one of Interest.com’s business  partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use of Personally Identifiable  Information</strong> </p>
<p>Interest.com  uses your personally identifiable information as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>to improve Interest.com’s marketing and promotional  efforts, analyze site usage, improve Interest.com’s content and product  offerings, and customize Interest.com 's content, layout, and services;</li>
<li>to contact you and deliver information to you that, in  some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner  advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications  relevant to your use of &nbsp;www.interest.com;</li>
<li>to fulfill your requests for certain products and  services;</li>
<li>for market research, project planning, troubleshooting  problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal  activity, to enforce Interest.com’s Terms of Use, for other internal purposes,  and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection; and</li>
<li>as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>You  expressly agree to Interest.com's use of your personally identifiable  information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable  Information</strong></p>
<p>Unless you  are entering one of Interest.com’s sweepstakes, Interest.com does not currently  sell your personally identifiable information.&nbsp;  The following describes some of the ways that your personally  identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advertisers</strong>.&nbsp;  Interest.com may aggregate personally identifiable information and  disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to  advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional  purposes.&nbsp; For example, Interest.com may  aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose it to network  advertisers in a non-personally identifiable manner as set forth in the section  entitled "Network Advertisers," set forth below. <u>Interest.com does  not disclose your information in a personally identifiable manner to such third  party advertisers without your consent</u>.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>External Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp; There are a number of separate services  offered by third parties, including, without limitation, Interest.com’s  affiliates, that Interest.com refers to as external service providers that may  be complementary to your use of www.interest.com (e.g. realtors, mortgage  brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card issuers, information  aggregators).&nbsp; If you choose to use these  separate services, disclose information to the external service providers,  and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use  of your information is governed by their privacy policy.&nbsp; With your consent, Interest.com may provide  some of your personal information to the external service provider offering  such services, for your convenience.&nbsp; To  prevent Interest.com’s disclosure of your personally identifiable information  to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use  their services.&nbsp; You should evaluate the  practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Service Providers</strong>.&nbsp; Interest.com may use third parties that  Interest.com refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource  one or more aspects of Interest.com’s business, product and service operations  that Interest.com provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts,  analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore Interest.com  may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal  service providers.&nbsp; These internal  service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with Interest.com  or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information  Interest.com provides them for any other purpose except to facilitate the  specific outsourced Interest.com related operation, unless you have explicitly  agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.&nbsp; In some instances, the internal service  provider may collect information directly from you.&nbsp; In these cases, you will be notified of the  involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information  you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you.&nbsp; If you provide additional information to an  internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally  identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Interest.com reserves the right (and you authorize Interest.com)  to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when Interest.com  determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally  identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal  action against you if:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy       or Interest.com’s Terms of Use;</li>
<li>you are interfering with another's rights or       property, including, without limitation, Interest.com's rights or       property; </li>
<li>you are violating any applicable law, rule or       regulation; </li>
<li>necessary or required by any applicable law, rule       or regulation; and/or </li>
<li>requested by       authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local,       regional or national emergency. </li>
</ul>
<p>Personally identifiable information and  other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a  result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy  (a “Transfer”) involving Interest.com and/or its affiliates.&nbsp; Interest.com specifically reserves the right  to transfer personally identifiable information collected from  www.interest.com, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable  information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer,  and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of  Interest.com to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including  www.interest.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for  any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.</p>
<p>In  addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, Interest.com cannot  ensure that all of your private communications and other personally  identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise  described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By way  of example (without limiting the foregoing), Interest.com may be forced to  disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain  circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions  or private communications.&nbsp; Therefore,  although Interest.com uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy,  Interest.com does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally  identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are submitting personally identifiable  information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, Interest.com reserves the right to  share, loan, rent and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you  submit with its affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the  Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for the  specific guidelines regarding information sharing and disclosure.</p>
<p><strong> Network  Advertising</strong></p>
<p> Interest.com may use third-party advertising companies for marketing,  advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to  you.&nbsp; Using third-party advertising  companies helps us and third-party advertisers better determine which  advertisements or content to serve to you.&nbsp;  For example, the third-party advertisers may use information regarding  your visits to www.interest.com and other Web sites in order to provide  advertisements about goods and services, that third party advertisers believe  will be of interest to you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The types of information that may be collected by third-party  advertising companies include the following:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>the type of Internet browser you  use; </li>
<li>the type of computer operating  system you use; </li>
<li>the domain name of a Web site you  visit, as well as information related to Web sites and Web pages you are  viewing when an advertisement is requested; </li>
<li>whether or not you visit specific  pages of www.interest.com or other Web sites;</li>
<li>the location of your Internet  service provider's point of presence; </li>
<li>the date and time of a visit to a  Web site;</li>
<li>search keywords passed from another  server; </li>
<li>the number of times you have  clicked on an advertisement; and</li>
<li>other interactions between you and  a Web site.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of third-party advertising  companies' use of such information, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.&nbsp; If you would  like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not  having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/">click here</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out  and Changes to Personally Identifiable Information and Use Preferences</strong></p>
<p>  You may at any time request a copy of Interest.com’s record  of your personally identifiable information, change your personally  identifiable information or use preferences, or opt-out of Interest.com's use  of your personally identifiable information by contacting Interest.com at <a href="mailto:webmaster@interest.com">webmaster@interest.com</a>. </p>
<p>If you would  like to opt-out of third-party advertising companies' use of your information  for the network advertising purposes described above, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Newsletters  and CAN-SPAM Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Interest.com sends only verified, double-opt-in e-mail  newsletters, specifically requested by Interest.com subscribers. Subscriptions  to Interest.com newsletters are verified by sending an e-mail confirmation to  your e-mail address, which requires a positive response before an e-mail  address is added to Interest.com’s list. Interest.com is fully compliant with  the Controlling  the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie  technology</strong></p>
<p>"Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the  form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your  computer's hard drive. Interest.com, its external service providers, internal  service providers, and third-party advertising companies, may set and access  cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you.  Interest.com, and its external service providers, internal service providers,  and third-party advertising companies gather anonymous information about you  through cookie technology on an aggregate level only. For example, a  third-party advertising company may assign a cookie (and a Web beacon,  described below) to you, to limit the amount of times you see a particular advertisement  or to help better determine which advertisements to serve to you.&nbsp; Please note that most Internet browsers will  allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete  cookies stored on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Web  beacons</strong></p>
<p>”Web beacons”, also called single-pixels  (1x1) or clear GIFs, are electronic images that allow a Web site to access  cookies and help track marketing campaigns and general usage patterns of  visitors to those Web sites.&nbsp; Web beacons  can recognize certain types of information, such as cookie numbers, time and  date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is  placed.&nbsp; <em>No personally identifiable  information about you is shared with third parties through the use of Web  beacons.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal use of Web beacons.</strong>&nbsp;  Interest.com may use Web beacons internally to count users and recognize  users through cookies.&nbsp; Access to cookies  helps Interest.com personalize your experience when you visit  Interest.com.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Email.</strong>&nbsp; Interest.com may  include Web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that Interest.com or its  affiliates or agents send.&nbsp; Including Web  beacons in email messages helps Interest.com determine your interest in and the  effectiveness of such emails.</li>
<li><strong>External use of Web beacons.</strong>&nbsp;  Interest.com may also use Web beacons externally.&nbsp; For example, Interest.com may report  aggregate information about Interest.com users, such as demographic and usage  information, to its partners and other third parties.&nbsp; Interest.com may also include other company’s  Web beacons within Interest.com.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Personally identifiable information you submit to  Interest.com is password-protected for your privacy and security. In certain  areas Interest.com uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data  transmissions. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party  compromises Interest.com security measures, Interest.com will not be  responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized  third party's ability to view, use or disseminate such information.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web sites</strong></p>
<p>  www.interest.com may include links to other third party Web  sites. Such links are not an endorsement by Interest.com of those Web sites  and/or the products or services offered there. Third party Web sites may have different  privacy policies and Interest.com is not responsible for the privacy practices  of those third party Web sites. If you click on a link to a third party Web  site, Interest.com encourages you to check the privacy policy of that Web site,  as it may differ substantially from that of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Questions or Concerns</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions, comments, concerns or feedback  regarding this Privacy Policy, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@interest.com">webmaster@interest.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Governing  Law; Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is to be governed by and construed in  accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard for  principles of conflicts of laws. Any civil action, claim, dispute or proceeding  arising out of, or relating to, this Privacy Policy shall be referred to final  and binding arbitration, before a single arbitrator, under the commercial  arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach County,  Florida. You and Interest.com shall select the arbitrator, and if you and  Interest.com are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator  within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the  American Arbitration Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall  not commence until the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars  ($1,000.00) with the arbitrator as a retainer for the arbitrator's fees and  costs. The party requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required  from time to time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator's fees and costs until  the prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an  alternate allocation of fees and costs.</p>
<p>Judgment  upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and  conclusive upon you and Interest.com, and your and Interest.com's respective  administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and  may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the  previous sentence, in no event shall either you or Interest.com be entitled to punitive,  special, indirect or consequential damages, and both you and Interest.com  hereby waive your rights to any punitive, special, indirect or consequential  damages, including, but not limited to, damages for any loss of profit, revenue  or business.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>  If any portion of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful,  void or unenforceable by any arbitrator, this Privacy Policy as a whole shall  not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this  Privacy Policy that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from  this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p> The headings contained in this Privacy Policy are for  convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Privacy  Policy, and shall not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or  interpretation of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties  made in this Privacy Policy, as may be amended by Interest.com from time to  time, shall survive your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This  Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use represent the entire understanding and  agreement between you and Interest.com regarding the subject matter of the  same, and supersede all other previous agreements, understandings and/or  representations regarding the same.</p>
