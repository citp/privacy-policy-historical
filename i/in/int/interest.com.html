	<div class="post">
<p align="center"><b>Last updated: October 8, 2013</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information when you use our Services.&nbsp; The terms “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Bankrate, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its legal subsidiaries and affiliates.&nbsp; The term “Services,” means, collectively, various websites, applications, widgets, email notifications and other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of Your Information (collectively, “Use of Your Information”) as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about you, which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information, medical and health history information, and/or financial information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of you using our Services, and does not apply to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information collected through mediums other than our Services;</li>
<li>Information collected through our Services where a separate privacy policy applies, such as a sweepstakes entry (you should refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or</li>
<li>Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or lead form).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span> and any other documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span>. &nbsp;These documents describe information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span> carefully.</p>
<p><b><i>Information We Collect and Receive About You </i></b></p>
<p>We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the information described below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide</span></p>
<p>The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;</li>
<li>When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;</li>
<li>When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or website;</li>
<li>When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via email or other means;</li>
<li>When you participate in online surveys;</li>
<li>When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; and</li>
<li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Third Parties Provide</span></p>
<p>We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Use and Preference Information</span></p>
<p>We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Information</span></p>
<p>When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time.&nbsp; In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service.&nbsp; We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.<b></b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location Information</span></p>
<p>If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates.&nbsp; We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phone Numbers</span></p>
<p>We may collect your phone number in several ways.&nbsp; For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</span></p>
<p>We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device.&nbsp; “Cookies” are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device.&nbsp; A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with cookies.&nbsp; Other “anonymous identifiers” are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available.&nbsp; These technologies help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services.</p>
<p>The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity.&nbsp; Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you).&nbsp; If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.</p>
<p>The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have access or control over these technologies.<b></b></p>
<p><b><i>How We Use Information</i></b></p>
<p>We may make Use of Your Information for various lawful business purposes.&nbsp; Among others, these purposes may include using Your Information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Engage in customer support</i>.&nbsp; For example, we might confirm and complete transactions requested by you, verify information you provide to us and provide you with administrative notices.</li>
<li><i>Contact you and provide you with information</i>.&nbsp; For example, we might provide or contact you through telephone, email, postal or other communications with Service updates, promotional materials, surveys, offers, quotes, personalized information and other information from us or our business partners.</li>
<li><i>Analyze, improve and manage our Services and operations.</i>&nbsp; For example, we might obtain feedback regarding our Services, understand and anticipate your needs and preferences, better understand your use of our Services, customize and tailor Service content and advertising, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, engage in statistical analysis and provide feedback to our vendors, advertisers and other third parties.</li>
<li><i>Resolve problems and disputes, and engage in other legal and security matters</i>. For example, we may use Your Information to comply with, monitor compliance with and enforce this Privacy Policy, our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span> and any other applicable agreements and policies, meet other legal and regulatory requirements, and to protect the security and integrity of our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>How We Disclose Information </i></b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Disclosure of Your Information</span></p>
<p>We may disclose Your Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
<li>To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials, and our Services’ maintenance and security. These companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;</li>
<li>To third parties such as insurance providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services, or information from one or more of those third parties (“Requested Service Providers”), such as by clicking “get your quotes” or other similar buttons at the end of a form;</li>
<li>To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party.&nbsp; When we disclose Your Information to these third parties, Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;</li>
<li>To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest;</li>
<li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</li>
<li>As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another’s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;</li>
<li>If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>
<li>To enforce our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span>, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;</li>
<li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>

<li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information.</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</span></p>
<p>As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a “Request”).&nbsp; <b>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.&nbsp; YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.&nbsp; Requested Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research.&nbsp; As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application.&nbsp; Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance.&nbsp; Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance.&nbsp; In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a “insurance score” for you.&nbsp; <b>If you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</b>.</p>
<p><b>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregation and De-Personalization</span></p>
