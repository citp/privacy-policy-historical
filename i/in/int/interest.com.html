</li><li><strong>Information we collect when you use the Interest.com/MMIS Personal Finance Assistant Profile</strong><br>
Interest.com/MMIS and our authorized partners may collect information from you through our Personal Finance Assistant Profile collection forms. Participation in this service is completely voluntary, and you decide whether or not to disclose your personal information.<br><br>
