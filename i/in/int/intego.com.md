The following information is stored with FastSpring:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Mailing Address

All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

## How We Use Cookies

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it.

Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to sites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit [allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

When you are on one of the Intego partner websites, we do not collect cookies nor use them for ad serving.

## Security

We use commercially suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on our Site. These procedures include, but are not limited to, encryption, SSL (secure socket layer), passwords, and physical security. We also limit access to any personally identifiable information we receive to employees who need access to that information in order to do their jobs. However, no data protection procedures are entirely infallible. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that it will be 100% secure.

## Sharing Your Information

With the exception of data noted above under the “FastSpring” section used to facilitate subscriptions of paid customers, we do not share any personally identifiable information with any third parties.

We may share aggregated non-identifiable information about our general readership with third parties in order to help market our products and develop new vendor and customer relationships.

We do not sell or rent personal information collected through Intego’s Site to anyone.

Other Circumstances: We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of any or all of our business and/or our assets to a third party, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to:

  * Comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process (such as a subpoena), or enforceable government request;
  * Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations of such Terms, or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; and
  * Protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Intego, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.



## Third-Party Websites and Social Media Features

Intego’s Site may contain links to other sites, including those of third parties or business partners such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices other websites use. By accessing other third party websites or applications through our Site, you are consenting to the terms and privacy policies of those websites. It is possible that other parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use Intego’s Site.

## Review and Correction of Your Information

You may review and edit the information Intego collected about you at any time. If your information has been shared with a third party, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, then that third party has received its own copy of your data. If you have been contacted by one of these third parties and wish to correct or delete your information, please contact them directly.

## California Privacy Rights

California law allows California residents to ask companies with whom they have an established business relationship to provide certain information about the companies’ sharing of personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Intego does not share any California consumer personal information with third parties for marketing purposes without consent.
