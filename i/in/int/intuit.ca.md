If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Statement or practices, please contact us as detailed under the How to Contact Us heading below.

**1.    ****WHEN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT APPLIES. If a Service you’re using links to this Privacy Statement, this Statement applies to you.**

This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, "Services") that link to this Statement. Intuit Canada ULC is the controller of all Personal Information subject to this Statement for our Services targeted to Canadian customers. We also provide Services in many other different countries.  If you are accessing a non-Canada version of our Services, the Intuit entity responsible for your Personal Information can be found here.

**2.    ****WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION.** **We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, improve your financial life, operate our business, and help make our Services useful, more intelligent, and work better for you. We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses without your consent.**

**a)  ** **Types of Information We Collect _._** In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you ("Personal Information"), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.

We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, use a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback. We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third party account or service with your Intuit Service, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.

We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services ("Usage Data"), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services. We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.

Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.

**b)  ** **How We Use Your Information.** We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:

__Account Registration__ _._ We may use your name, address, phone number, and email address to register your account for certain Services we provide and to communicate important information to you.

__To Provide Our Services and Operate Our Business__ _._ We may use your information to operate our business, including providing Services you requested, provide you with support related to our Services, and to help us protect our Services, including to combat fraud and protect your information.

__Customer Service and Technical Support__ _.   _We may use your name, address, phone number, email address, how you interact with our Services, and information about your computer configuration to resolve questions you may have about our Services and to follow up with you about your experience.  We also offer various Internet chat services, for example, to speak with an Intuit support representative or tax advisor.  Internet Chat transmissions are encrypted but you should not supply more Personal Information, including tax data, than is required to address your specific issue.  A transcript of the session is retained to resolve questions or issues related to our Services.

__Research, Including Publishing or Sharing Combined Information from Many Users, But Only in a Way that Would Not Allow You or Any Other Person to be Identified__ _._ Only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified, we may prepare and share information about our customers with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for research, academic, marketing and/or promotional purposes.  For example, we may share demographic data that describes the percentage of our customers who use mobile services or who use a particular operating system. We or our third party partners may publicly report the aggregated findings of the research or analysis, but only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified.

We use this information to update and maintain the account information you download, to assist with the download process, and to enhance the Services we may provide in the future.

We work with other companies or developers to offer you products and services and you may choose to sync, link or connect other third party services with your Intuit Service.  Sometimes Intuit may let you know about the service or product, or another company may let you know about an Intuit service or product.  It will be clear who is referring the service or product, and who is providing the service or product.  If you choose to accept these services, providing your consent to either the third party or to us, we may exchange your information, including your Personal Information, as well as information about how you interact with each company’s service or product. This exchange of information is necessary to maintain business operations and to provide the ongoing service you’ve requested.  By requesting or accepting these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your information, including your Personal Information, to the other party.

**e) ** **Intuit Single Sign** **-On.** Intuit Single Sign-On is a Service that allows you to sign-in to a variety of Intuit Services. We will collect certain information for security purposes in order to verify your authorized access to an account or to reset your password if you cannot access your Intuit account. Some Services may require added security and may be asked to provide additional information. The email address and password that you use to sign up for an Intuit account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. We assign a unique ID number to your credentials to track you and your associated information. Intuit Services do not allow sharing of accounts between users or individuals.

Intuit (and entities and subsidiaries covered by Intuit’s privacy shield certification) participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  We are committed to subjecting all personal data, including Personal Information, received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).  We also maintain an affirmative commitment to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and its principles, which will not be affected by our participation in the Privacy Shield.

Under the Privacy Shield Framework, Intuit is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives from the EU and then transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  We remain liable in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process such personal data on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

With respect to personal data receivedortransferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Intuit is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, Intuit may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
