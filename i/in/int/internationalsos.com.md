The App provides personal information including your or your organization's International SOS Membership Number, as well as the email address of your mobile device.  To enable location-specific services, the App also collects and divulges your location.  The App also periodically provides information concerning your usage of particular App features.

When you choose to pay for International SOS services or products by credit card directly from the International SOS website, you will be required to provide International SOS with the name of your credit card issuer, credit card number, expiration date and other security information.
