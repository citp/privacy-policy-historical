### As a buyer

It is very important for you to understand that our service is designed to make your requests visible to others, while we keep your identity anonymous. Therefore, when you create a request, the text you enter in the "what", "where", "when" and "other information" fields will be visible on the Internet. We will not publish your personal details intentionally, but if you enter your personal details into any of the aforementioned fields, then that will be made visible to others on the Internet by design.

When you sign up to use our service as a buyer, we request the following information from you:

  * Your username
  * Your email address



### As a seller

When you sign up as a seller, we ask you to provide a variety of information about your business and services including:

  * Your username

  * Various other information and services



We publish this information in a number of places on our website, always with the intention of promoting your business. 

### Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we hold about you. 

### Account administration

From time to time, one of our administrators may edit your list of services to ensure that you are getting the best possible supplier alerts based on requests being raised by users. In addition, if you are signed up and raise a request, we may occasionally raise a further request on your behalf if we feel that we can better target potential suppliers for your needs. 

### Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the Internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally. These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example: 

  * Enabling our service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task.
  * Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested.



You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Declining cookies will prevent you from taking full advantage of our service. 

Note that we also use a few third party tools to monitor the use of our system. These tools are Google Analytics, HEAP Analytics, and Mouseflow, and they use cookies in order to work correctly. Our only purpose behind using these tools is to learn more about how our system is used. Please read their privay policies to understand what they do with your personal data and how you can opt out if necessary.
