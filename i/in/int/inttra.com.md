Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website  
[https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

We also may collect sensitive information, such as invoice/payment information or tax ID in connection with specific inttra products. We will not share, sell or trade your personal data with third parties for promotional purposes without your consent. We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

inttra and/or its affiliates and third party service providers may use the personal data to:

  2. monitor and analyze System activity including how the System is used, and the volume and frequency of access, so as to improve the System and the Services;
  3. contact you regarding your inquiries, your use of the System, changes to the System or the Services and to otherwise operate the System;
  4. comply with any applicable law or other legal or regulatory requirements, to respond to a request or subpoena by a government, regulatory or judicial authority, where necessary in connection with a dispute, actual or potential litigation or other legal process or an internal or external audit, or where otherwise necessary to protect the interests of inttra, its affiliates, third party service providers or other participants in the System; and
  5. supplement your personal data with third party sources for background verification.



With your consent, inttra and/or its affiliates may use the personal data to market products and services of inttra and/or its affiliates and third party service providers to your Company through use of post, fax or by e-mail; please note that if inttra sends marketing materials to you we will include a working unsubscribe link so you can unsubscribe.

inttra will also send you Service related e-mail announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an e-mail. You do not have an option to opt out of these e-mails, which are not promotional in nature.

In addition, any third party offering a service directly to your Company in connection with our Services or on our Websites (including, without limitation, live chat service providers, e-mail service providers and recruiting platforms) (collectively “ **Partners** ”) may use your personal data to: (a) provide the Services; (b) contact you regarding your inquiries; and (c) market its products and services to your Company through use of post, fax or by e-mail. If you do not want us to share your personal data with these companies, contact us at  [service@inttra.com](mailto:service@inttra.com).

Third party personal data may also be entered on our System, such as if your Company has elected to use an administrator to enter the personal data about its users. If this data is collected on our System, it will only be used for the stated purpose for which it was collected.

If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at [service@inttra.com](mailto:service@inttra.com).

**User Data Supplementation**

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include: 

  1. Purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products.

  4. any affiliate, agent, sub-contractor or adviser of inttra, and/or its third party service providers or Partners, or a participant in the System, or a government, regulatory or judicial authority, as applicable, where necessary to protect the interests of inttra, the public, or other participants in the System, for example, in the event of suspected fraud or illegal activity; and
  5. anyone to whom you authorize inttra to give your personal data, including parties you have authorized to access your personal data in connection with your enrollment as a User and as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.
