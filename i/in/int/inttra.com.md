### INTTRA Privacy and Security Policy

**Updated May 10, 2003**

This Privacy and Security Policy applies to all data and information INTTRA may obtain about You, once You have used the INTTRA system. It should be read in conjunction with the INTTRA Website Legal Terms and Conditions and all defined terms in that agreement have the same meaning in this Privacy and Security Policy. 

This document provides INTTRA's current policy with regard to both "Personally Identifiable Information" and "Business Transaction Data." Personally Identifiable Information is information which can identify You which is collected by INTTRA through the INTTRA Portal, by e-mail correspondence, through third parties offering information/services through the Portal, or by any other means, and includes Your name, title, company name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Business Transaction Data is any information provided by You or about You related to transactions conducted at, on or through the Portal, INTTRA-ACT or INTTRA-LINK or is provided to INTTRA by third parties offering information/services at, on or through the Portal, INTTRA-ACT or INTTRA-LINK. In addition to disclosure to third parties as indicated below, the information You provide will be used by INTTRA to contact You regarding Your inquiries and to otherwise operate the INTTRA Portal. 

INTTRA and/or its affiliates may use Personally Identifiable Information and Business Transaction Data, and monitor Portal activity generally, to collect information on how the Portal is used, and the volume and frequency of access, so that we may improve the Portal and make recommendations to third parties to improve the Services. INTTRA will not provide Your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties unless authorized by You, without Your express prior consent, except as permitted under this Privacy and Security Policy or under the Website Legal Terms and Conditions. While aggregate or other information not identifiable with any particular participant, shipment or carrier may be used or disclosed for other purposes and to other parties, INTTRA limits access to the participant's Personally Identifiable Information to the parties described herein. 

Personally Identifiable Information and Business Transaction Data provided to INTTRA, by or about You, may be transmitted by INTTRA to third parties for the purposes of operating the INTTRA Portal and for the provision of third party Services. This is true even though a subsequent shipment may have been arranged through channels independent of INTTRA. All of the third parties offering information/services through the INTTRA Portal to You will receive User's registration data and relevant Business Transaction Data. In addition, information about particular shipments and Personally Identifiable Information relevant to such shipments may be accessed by or transmitted to those arranging to have goods shipped by carriers and by others involved with such shipments, as well as by all parties named on the relevant bill of lading for that shipment, and by any other parties You have named as being authorized to access the data. You acknowledge that INTTRA is not responsible for information or data in the possession of such third parties regardless of how such data was obtained. Please consult the privacy policies of these third parties to learn how they may use or disclose Your information. You may be contacted directly by an individual carrier. Without limitation of any provision in the Website Legal Terms and Conditions, INTTRA assumes no responsibility for nor shall in any way be liable for any loss of information or data nor for any improper use or disclosure of data resulting from any third party's unauthorized access to, use of, or alteration of confidential data or information provided to INTTRA by You. 

Additionally, INTTRA may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in the following circumstances: 

* Where disclosure is required by law, in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, to satisfy a port, state or customs security initiative, or reports to government authorities. 
* To companies that provide technical services to us, such as data processing companies only when such companies are bound to confidentiality with INTTRA. In no way is a participating carrier recognized as a company that provides technical services to INTTRA. 
* In connection with an audit or other examination. 
* Where necessary to protect the interests of INTTRA or other participants in the shipments tracked on the INTTRA Portal, for example, in the event of suspected fraud or illegal activity. 
* Where the customer has consented to or requested disclosure. 

While no security procedures are fool-proof, INTTRA maintains procedures to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the data transmitted to and from, presented, and stored by INTTRA. However, INTTRA shall not be responsible or liable for any damages or losses arising directly or indirectly from intrusion. You and INTTRA shall make commercially-reasonable efforts to ensure the secure transfer of all EDI-data across data networks. 

The Personally Identifiable Information and Business Transaction Data we collect through the Portal is an asset of our business and in the event that INTTRA, or substantially all of its assets, are acquired or become the subject of a merger, such information may be transferred with the business. 

INTTRA may also use temporary "cookies" which is data sent to Your Web browser and stored on Your computer.
