**Inter-State Studio & Publishing Company® Privacy Policy**  
**Effective: November 11, 2009**

Inter-State Studio & Publishing Co. ("Inter-State") knows that you care how information about you is collected, used, maintained and disclosed, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices, and the manner in which Inter-State collects, uses and discloses information collected from you via the inter-state.com web site and any other web sites or online services operated by Inter-State where this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the "Web Site"). While the terms contained throughout this Privacy Policy apply to users of the Web Site in general, a separate children's section below discusses Inter-State's information practices relating to children under the age of 13 as they differ from our general practices. **By using the Web Site and/or registering an account, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

Please note that the Web Site may contain links to other web sites or online services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by third party web sites or services linked to or otherwise accessible from offerings presented by or through the Web Site. The information collected or received by third party Web sites is subject to their own privacy policies. We recommend that you review the privacy practices of such other web sites and services that you choose to visit or use. 

Inter-State is based, and this web site is hosted, in the United States of America. If you are from the European Union, Canada or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection, use and disclosure that may differ from U.S. law and you are registering an account on the Web Site, visiting the Web Site, purchasing products or services from Inter-State or the Web Site, or otherwise using the Web Site, please note that any personally identifiable information that you provide to Inter-State will be transferred to the United States. Any such personally identifiable information provided will be processed and stored in the United States by Inter-State or a service provider acting on its behalf. By providing your personally identifiable information, you hereby specifically and expressly consent to such transfer and processing and the uses and disclosures set forth herein. 

#### Collection of Your Information

Users browsing the Web Site without registering an account or affirmatively providing personally identifiable information to Inter-State do so anonymously. Otherwise, the information we collect consists of personally identifiable information collected from you when you register to use the Web Site or log into the Web Site as a registered user and interact with the Web Site. Such personally identifiable information may include (i) registration-related information (such as name, home or work addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, birth date or gender); (ii) transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, or a history of products purchased through Inter-State.com); (iii) demographic information; (iv) information about your visits to the Web Site, (v) and your responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on the Web Site; information about the features or offerings from Inter-State that you use, and how frequently you use them); (vi) your billing and shipping information; (vii) customer service information about you as a Web Site user or subscriber; and (viii) other information specifically related to your use of a particular Web Site feature or offering. We may collect information that you provide in email or other communications to us. Your information may be supplemented with additional information from other companies or gathered by Inter-State from other sources. 

We may also collect information about how you use the Web Site, including certain technical information gathered when you use the Web Site. While all of this information may not be personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that you provide to Inter-State through the Web Site or otherwise. Other information that may not personally identify you may be collected by Inter-State (such as patterns of utilization of the Web Site or any information that is de-identified) and may be utilized and disclosed by Inter-State as allowed by law. 

_Cookies_

Like most web sites, the Web Site uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Inter-State to recognize you as a user when you return to the Web Site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the Web Site or certain features thereon. Like the information you enter during account registration, cookie and log file data is used to enhance and personalize your experience on the Web Site, including (i) to operate and improve offerings through the Web Site; (ii) to help authenticate your identity when you visit; (iii) to remember your preferences and registration information; (iv) enable a shopping cart; (v) to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of our offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which Inter-State e-mails you open and act upon); and (vi) to customize the content and advertisements provide to you by Inter-State. One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you have logged in to your Web Site account. The next time you visit our Web Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Web Site. Additionally, if you log out of the Web Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Web Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. You can choose to disable cookies on your browser or allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, however this may prevent you from utilizing certain features of the Web Site. 

_IP Addresses_

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, we automatically receive the uniform resource locator (URL) of the web site from which you came and the web site to which you proceed once you leave the Web Site. We also receive the IP address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your Internet service provider (ISP). This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Web Site. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

_Web Beacons and Ad Networks_

We may allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to users via the Web Site. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Inter-State may "target" some ads to users that fit a certain general profile. To deliver these ads properly, the Web Site may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Web Site so the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other web sites. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other web sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. In addition, the Web Site may use the technology of ad networks to serve ads only when you visit this Web Site. Ad networks may use non-personally identifiable information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of particular interest to you while you visit this Web Site. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. 

#### How Your Information Is Used

Inter-State may use the personally identifiable information collected through the Web Site (i) for the specific purposes for which the information was provided or collected; (ii) to provide the products and services available on the Web Site and the Web Site itself; (iii) to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services; (iv) to operate, improve and personalize the features, offerings and content presented to you via the Web Site; (v) to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; (vi) to conduct research about your use of our products; and (vii) to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest. Inter-State may use your information in the business planning, marketing, advertising and sales efforts of Inter-State and its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners. 

#### How Your Information Is Disclosed

Inter-State may disclose personally identifiable information collected from you to its parent, subsidiary and other related companies and Inter-State's trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners who will use the information for the purposes outlined in the "How Your Information Is Used" section above, as necessary to provide the services offered by the Web Site and the Web Site itself, to fulfill any orders for products and services ordered via the Web Site and for the specific purposes for which the information was collected. Your information will not be shared with third parties other than as set forth above unless you have consented to the sharing of your information. Inter-State may use your information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. 

Additionally, Inter-State may disclose personally identifiable information at the request of law enforcement or governmental agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, to establish, protect or exercise Inter-State's legal or other rights or to defend against a legal claim or as otherwise required by law. Inter-State may disclose personally identifiable information in order to protect the rights, property or safety of Inter-State or any other person. Inter-State may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate or prevent a violation by you of any contractual or other relationship with Inter-State or the perpetration of any illegal or harmful activity. 

Inter-State may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to investors and potential partners. Inter-State may disclose or transfer personally identifiable information collected from users in connection with or in contemplation of a sale of its assets or business or a merger, consolidation or other reorganization of its business. 

We may use agents and contractors in order to help provide the Web Site and Inter-State's products and services. If such agents and contractors have access to personally identifiable information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Inter-State. 

#### Our Commitment to Security

Inter-State and its service providers have established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your information, but cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, in the event of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or the policies of Inter-State). To protect your privacy and security, the Web Site requires the use of passwords to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to any of your information. We work to protect the security of your information during transport by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software which encrypts information you input. However, no security methods are perfect or impenetrable. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

#### Correcting, Changing or Updating Personal Information 

You can review the personal information you have provided us and make any desired changes to the information at any time by logging in to your account on the Web Site and editing the information. If you close your account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our account system. We may retain certain data contributed by you for legitimate business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, as aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, for account recovery purposes, if required by law, or as retained in our data backup systems. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which you have previously agreed. To request that we close your account and remove your personal information, please send your request to [issnet@inter-state.com](mailto:issnet@inter-state.com). Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with Inter-State under your name. 

#### Opting-Out of Disclosures of Personal Information

You always have the option to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information disclosed by Inter-State to third parties that are not agents or service providers of Inter-State. If you would like to opt-out of such further disclosures, please contact Inter-State at [issnet@inter-state.com](mailto:issnet@inter-state.com).
