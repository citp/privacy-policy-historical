When you register with our site to receive your free theme, we pledge to you that we will handle your personal information with the utmost respect and with safety at the top of the list. We will share with you any way that we will use your personal information. This applies to all personal information that you supply when you register and any information that you may provide in the future.

When you register with our site you may accept, or "opt-in" to, the terms of our privacy policy.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents or guardians, about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. We are also required to obtain the consent of parents, or guardians, to allow these children to use certain features of our web site. 

The type of information that we collect:

We only collect personal information if a child or a parent, or guardian, registers on our web site. A child or parent can surf our web site and can view content without any personal information being collected. 

The only information we collect from children during registration is gender, age group, computer usage, hobbies, their likes/dislikes, comments regarding our products and services, parents email address, child's email address, and demographic information. 

We use and share the information that we collect in the following way:

We use the information we collect to keep you up to date on our product offerings, to provide you with newsletters, and to help us build our products and services the way you want them. We are committed to offering up-to-date products and to offering products that our research proves to be desirable to our customers. We will offer sweepstakes and contests on this web site and your information will be used to notify you as needed. We will not share your child's personal information with any other group or entity except Callisto Corporation, the software provider for My Photo Adventure. Callisto Corporation will use the information that we collect to keep you up to date on their product offerings.

Parents, we get your consent and notify you in the following way:

Upon registering at our site the child and the parent will receive an email, the parent is given 48 hours to deny registration for their child. If the parent denies registration all of the child's recorded information is deleted from our database. If we do not hear back from the parent we assume the parent has approved of the child's choice to register with our site. If the parent approves registration, or does not reply as stated above, the child will be allowed to receive their free theme, enjoy our newsletter, and participate in sweepstakes and contest without any further notification to the parent.

If the child enters a sweepstakes or contest and wins we notify the parents via email at the email address provided upon registration to request more information and approval as needed. We may publish their 1st name, 1st initial of last name, city, state, and school name (when approved by the school).
