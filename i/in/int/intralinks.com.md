 **What information does IntraLinks collect from visitors to its website?**  
IntraLinks collects certain personally identifiable information through its website (1) when you choose to submit such information to us through e-mail, an online form, or other method, or (2) through a temporary cookie for the sole purpose of using one of our online forms or submitting information to us as described below. You may choose to provide IntraLinks with information in order to request additional information about IntraLinks's services, for press inquiries, or for other purposes. By providing IntraLinks with information, you consent to IntraLinks's use of this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, IntraLinks does not collect any information about you though our website without your knowledge and consent. 

Like all web servers, IntraLinks maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to our site, such as visitors' IP addresses (a computer's numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access intralinks.com, the type of web browsers used to access the site, and the pages viewed. However, all such logged information is in "aggregate" form, and IntraLinks does not associate this information with a specific visitor's name, computer or other personally identifiable information (in other words, you remain anonymous). 

IntraLinks also offers visitors the ability to search our site by entering certain keywords into our search engine. We do not keep any information regarding searches performed through the IntraLinks search engine. Top

IntraLinks will use information provided to IntraLinks to respond to specific requests for information about our services. We may also use your information to inform you about other IntraLinks services which might be of interest to you and to gather feedback from you on our website and our services. If you decide to purchase our services, we may use your information for the purposes of providing you those services. 

IntraLinks will not, without your consent, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide to any third party any information provided to us, except that IntraLinks (1) may disclose business contact information about you in response to a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, or other legal process; and (2) may disclose business contact information about you as IntraLinks, in our sole discretion, believes is appropriate in connection with an official government investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property. 

IntraLinks may use aggregate log information it collects from visitors to better understand how visitors use our site and to improve our site and our services. IntraLinks does not disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide aggregate log information to any third party. Top
