These agents or developers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to offer or complete the service we are outsourcing. 
    * **Co-branded and Third-Party Sites.** Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo.

Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site: 

  * **Cookies.** A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The Intuit Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer, based on the number of visits to those areas.

If you are a registered user on the Intuit.com Web site, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier.

Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and have access to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise, you may not be able to participate in certain areas of the Web sites. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. When you use the QuickBooks Universal Login to register for the Intuit Developer Network, you will receive a cookie as part of the personal identification process. This cookie will be used to confirm your identity each time you wish to access the Intuit Developer Network or other QuickBooks services. The cookie enables you to go from screen to screen without being repeatedly asked to authenticate your identity. 

Third party tracking systems in use on behalf of this Web site may assign different cookies to you.

You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at privacy@intuit.com. 

  * **Web Site Usage Data.** With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site.



**WE GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT HOW THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE US MAY BE USED.**

We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as credit card number, we support the encryption of your data as it is transmitted to us. 

We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site's servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information only to those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.
