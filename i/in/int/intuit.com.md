# Intuit.Com - Privacy Statement

**Intuit.com Privacy Statement** [ ](https://www.truste.org/validate/8259)

At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals and small businesses manage their financial lives. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 

This privacy statement describes privacy aspects specific to the Intuit.com Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "Intuit.com Web site"). It serves as an adjunct to the [Intuit Online Privacy Policy](http://privacy.intuit.com/policies), which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The Intuit Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy. 

Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children. 

**Our Philosophy and Practices**

We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site: 

  * We provide you notice of our Web site information practices. 
    * Order Status or Update
    * Payroll Services
    * Technical Support, QuickBooks Support Network (QBSN) and Customer Service
    * Beta Testing
    * Application for Employment with Intuit
    * Other
    * Mandatory and Optional Information
  * We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used. 
  * We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us. 
  * We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. 
  * We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other privacy aspects. 



**WE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEB SITE INFORMATION PRACTICES.**

To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed. 

Here is how and why we collect and use information from you: 

  * **Order Status or Update** ****
    * **Order Status.** We offer you the ability to check on the status of your online, mail or telephone purchase of Intuit products. We need the order number or confirmation number and ZIP code to locate the order. Alternatively, if you do not have your order or confirmation number, you may look up the number by entering your last name and telephone number. **.**
    *  **Order Update.** You may make changes to a current online, mail or telephone order for Intuit products - for example to, change address information or update billing information - or cancel an order through our Customer Service Web pages. We ask for your name, address, e-mail, telephone and order number to process your request. We do not use this information for other purposes without your permission. 
    * **Payroll Tax Services**
      * **Tax Table Service.** Our Tax Table Service keeps your payroll tax tables current. To subscribe to the Tax Table Service, we ask that you provide your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. We also inquire as to how you heard about the service. We use this information to deliver updates on federal and state payroll taxes to you. We do not use this information for other purposes without your permission. We may use your name and e-mail address to contact you regarding product issues, updates or promotional opportunities. 
      * **Basic Payroll Service.** The Basic Payroll Service replaces the Tax Table Service for QuickBooks 2000. Enrollment for the Basic Payroll Service online can only be accomplished through a registered version of the QuickBooks product. We ask you to provide your contact information, including your e-mail address and credit card information to purchase the service. We require your e-mail address so that we can quickly deliver service changes or update notices to you. We require the Employer Identification Number (EIN) for each company for which you wish to process payroll and cannot process your subscription without it. We use the EIN information as a unique identifier for providing the service, not for marketing purposes. We may use your name and e-mail address to contact you regarding product issues or updates or promotional opportunities. We do not use this information for other purposes without your permission. 
      * **Deluxe Payroll Service.** You may request a customized quote or additional information regarding the Deluxe Payroll Service either by telephone or online. Should you use our online request form, we require you to provide your name, telephone number, business name and address. Additionally, we ask for optional information regarding your business to better understand your needs. We may use this information to contact you regarding this service or other Intuit products. 
    * **Technical Support, QBSN and Customer Service**
      * **Technical Service Plan Enrollment.** Several support plans may be purchased directly from our Web site. We collect your name, address, e-mail, telephone number and payment information. We use this information to register you with the support plan that you have selected. We may use this information to deliver newsletters, support bulletins, or other components of your support plan, to contact you for renewals of your support plan, and for other marketing purposes. 
      * **QBSN Members Only Area.** If your support plan authorizes you to enter the QBSN Members Only Web site, we ask you to login using your e-mail address and password. Within this area, you may submit electronic incidents, review your case history and review online newsletters and other tips. To submit a new question, we will require you to provide certain information about your QuickBooks product, such as version or platform. We will use this information to research and respond to your issue. We may track your movement through this portion of the site (e.g., your Web page clicks) to better understand your needs. 
      * **Feedback on Intuit Products.** You may make product suggestions, submit an answer to a technical question, submit bug reports or make other suggestions regarding various Intuit products through the Technical Support section of our Web site. We only require specific information regarding the product and the nature of the situation, such as your suggestion or bug report. Should you include your name and e-mail address in your submission form, we may use this information to contact you regarding product updates or promotions. We will not respond, however, to your submissions. All submissions through this form are treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and, as such, may be published or used by Intuit for other purposes. 
      * **Submitting Questions**. You may ask us questions regarding Intuit products, policies and procedures through our Web site. Our submission request form enables you to send specific questions or comments to us. We request your name and e-mail address so that we may respond to your inquiry. All submissions through this form are treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and, as such, may be published or used by Intuit for other purposes. 
    * **Beta Testing Registration.** You may request to become a Beta tester for various Intuit products. We ask you to submit your name, address, e-mail address, your preferences on which Intuit product(s) you wish to test and the operating system you use. We will use this information to contact you and to request additional information to select you for one of our beta testing programs. Each of our Beta testing programs will require specific information from you as a tester and those requirements will be detailed as you are selected to test our products. At no time, will we share personally identifiable information collected as part of Beta Testing with our affiliates or third parties other than is necessary to test the product being reviewed. 
    * **Application for Employment with Intuit.** You may apply for employment at Intuit via our careers Web page. For each position in which you are interested, we ask you to submit your contact information and resume. This information will be used to evaluate your qualifications for the desired position and possibly to contact you for further information. We do not share this information with third parties except, as necessary in accordance with our employment practices. 
    * **Other** ****
      * **Newsletters**. You may subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications by providing your e-mail address. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter. We may use your e-mail address to send you promotional materials. When sending you e-mail we may automatically collect technical information that allows us to format messages to best align with your computer's capabilities. This data is used solely to enhance the presentation of the content you receive. 
      * **Contests and Surveys**. From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings or award prizes. Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.

**HOW WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGY:**

Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site: 

  * **Cookies**. A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The Intuit Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer, based on the number of visits to those areas. 

> If you are a registered user on the Intuit.com Web site, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as the technical support section for Premier Service Plan members. 
> 
> If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site. Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and have access to special areas of the Web site and you have modified your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise, you may not be able to participate in certain areas of the Web sites. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. 
> 
> Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies. Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at [privacy@intuit.com](https://orderupdate.intuit.com/record.asp?topic=privacy). 

  * **Web Site Usage Data**. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site. 
  * **Co-branded and Third-Party Sites**. Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The Intuit.com Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information. 



If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect. 

In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant. 

**WE GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT HOW THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE US MAY BE USED.**

We give you the opportunity to keep us from using or sharing the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us for purposes other than to fulfill your request. We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information you provide us, whenever we gather it. Simply notify us during the information collection process or contact us at [privacy@intuit.com](https://orderupdate.intuit.com/record.asp?topic=privacy).

**WE WORK TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM LOSS, MISUSE AND UNAUTHORIZED ALTERATION.**

We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever you transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web site, we provide you access to our servers that allow encryption of your data as it is transmitted to us. 

We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site's servers from unauthorized access using commercially available computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign these practices which include limiting access to sensitive information only to those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.
