## Third Party Cookies

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

## External Links

This site contains links to web sites not owned and not necessarily endorsed by the operators of InterfaceLIFT. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external Web sites.

## Spam

The operators of this web site do not participate in the practice of spamming. Spamming is the sending of bulk, unsolicited email.

Visitors who submit content to the web site may opt out of having their email address posted on InterfaceLIFt's web pages. Additionally, the operators of the site attempt to protect the email addresses of its content providers from email address harvesters by masking or encoding addresses that are reachable through links or forms on the web site.

Our InterfaceLIFT Weekly [newsletter](https://web.archive.org/newsletter/) is a double opt-in email list. This protects you from being signed up for email you are not interested in receiving. When an email address is submitted to our email list, a confirmation message is sent to your inbox. You will only receive newsletter emails if you confirm your subscription by clicking on the link contained in the confirmation message. This prevents the situation where someone else might sign you up because the subscription may only be activated by someone who has access to your inbox. Email addresses that have not been confirmed are occassionally purged from our system.

We recognize that occassionally users may want to stop receiving newsletter messages they signed up for. Clear unsubscribe instructions are available at the bottom of each InterfaceLIFT Weekly newsletter. You may also unsubscribe at any time by visiting our [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/newsletter/unsubscribe.php) page.
