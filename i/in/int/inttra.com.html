<h1>INTTRA Privacy and Security Policy</h1>
<h2>Updated January 10, 2007</h2>

<p></p><p>This Privacy and Security Policy applies to all data and information INTTRA 
may obtain about You, once You have used the INTTRA system.&nbsp; It should be read 
in conjunction with the INTTRA Legal Terms and Conditions (“Legal Terms and 
Conditions”) and all defined terms in that agreement have the same meaning in 
this Privacy and Security Policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This document provides INTTRA’s current policy with regard to "Personally 
Identifiable Information" (“PII”).&nbsp; PII is non-public information identifiable 
with any particular named natural person.&nbsp; PII is collected by INTTRA through 
the Portal, by e-mail correspondence, through third parties, or by any other 
means.&nbsp; In addition to disclosure to third parties as indicated below, the 
information You provide will be used by INTTRA and its affiliates to contact You 
regarding Your inquiries and to otherwise operate the Portal.</p>
<p>INTTRA and/or its affiliates may use PII, and monitor Portal activity 
generally, for other business purposes including marketing, to collect 
information on how the Portal is used, and the volume and frequency of access, 
so that we may improve the Portal and make recommendations to third parties to 
improve the Services.&nbsp; INTTRA does not provide Your PII to third parties unless 
authorized by You, without Your express prior consent, except as permitted under 
this Privacy and Security Policy or under the Legal Terms and Conditions.&nbsp; While 
aggregate or other information not identifiable with any particular named 
natural person may be used or disclosed for other purposes and to other parties 
as deemed appropriate by INTTRA, INTTRA limits access to the participant's PII 
to the parties described herein.</p>
<p>PII obtained by INTTRA about You may be transmitted by INTTRA to third 
parties for the purposes of operating the Portal and for the marketing and/or 
provision of third party services. This is true even though a subsequent 
shipment may have been arranged through channels independent of INTTRA.&nbsp; All of 
the third parties offering information/Services through the Portal may receive 
Your PII.&nbsp; In addition, information about particular shipments and PII relevant 
to such shipments may be accessed by or transmitted to those arranging to have 
goods shipped by carriers and by others involved with such shipments, as well as 
by all parties named on the relevant bill of lading for that shipment, by any 
other parties You have named as being authorized to access the data, and as 
otherwise provided in this policy.&nbsp; You acknowledge that INTTRA is not 
responsible for information or data in the possession of such third parties 
regardless of how such data was obtained. Please consult the privacy policies of 
these third parties to learn how they may use or disclose Your information. You 
may be contacted directly by an individual carrier. Without limitation of any 
provision in the Legal Terms and Conditions, INTTRA assumes no responsibility 
for, nor shall in any way be liable for any loss of information or data nor for, 
any improper use or disclosure of data resulting from any third party's 
unauthorized access to, use of, or alteration of confidential data or 
information provided to INTTRA by You. </p>
<p>Additionally, INTTRA may disclose any information, including PII, in the 
following circumstances: </p>
<ul><li>In connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, to satisfy a port, 
state or customs security initiative, reports to, or responses to requests by,&nbsp; 
government authorities, or where disclosure is otherwise permitted or required 
by law. 
</li><li>To companies that provide technical services to us, such as data processing 
companies only when such companies are bound to confidentiality with INTTRA. In 
no way is a participating carrier recognized as a company that provides 
technical services to INTTRA. 
</li><li>In connection with an audit or other examination. 
</li><li>Where necessary to protect the interests of INTTRA, the public, or other 
participants in the shipments tracked on the Portal, for example, in the event 
of suspected fraud or illegal activity. 
</li><li>Where we deem it useful in connection with disputes or litigation. 
</li><li>Where the customer has consented to or requested disclosure. </li></ul>
<p>While no security procedures are fool-proof, INTTRA maintains procedures to 
minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the data transmitted to and from, 
presented, and stored by INTTRA. However, INTTRA shall not be responsible or 
liable for any damages or losses arising directly or indirectly from intrusion. 
You shall make commercially-reasonable efforts to ensure the secure transfer of 
all data across data networks. </p>
<p>The PII we collect through the Portal is an asset of our business and in the 
event that INTTRA, or a portion of its assets, are acquired or become the 
subject of a merger, such information may be transferred with the business, or 
disclosed to potential acquirers or others involved in any such transaction.</p>
<p>INTTRA may also use temporary "cookies" which is data sent to Your Web 
browser and stored on Your hard drive. These cookies permit our server to 
identify You when You visit the INTTRA Web site in the future. Most Web browsers 
will allow You to be notified if a cookie is sent to You to enable You to decide 
if You want to accept it or not. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled on 
Your computer, all features/functions of the INTTRA Web site may not work 
properly. </p>
<p>In addition, a cookie file may also be placed on your hard drive by INTTRA or 
third parties providing services to INTTRA, including advertising companies.&nbsp; 
INTTRA and these companies may use data about your visits to this and other Web 
sites in order to provide advertisements about transportation related goods and 
services that you may be interested in. </p>
<p>When you use INTTRA Services, our servers automatically record information 
that your browser sends whenever you visit a Web site (“Server Logs”). These 
Server Logs may include information such as your Web request, Internet Protocol 
address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and 
one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We may combine the 
information we obtain with information from other services or third parties in 
order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our 
Services and advertising. </p>
<p>INTTRA may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether 
these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality 
of our Service, search technology, customized content, advertising and other 
business purposes.&nbsp; For example, when you click on a link displayed on INTTRA, 
the fact that you clicked on the link may be sent to INTTRA. In this way, INTTRA 
is able to record information about how you use our Web site and Services, and 
in order to calculate how much the advertiser should be charged.&nbsp; In addition, 
clicking on the “Request for Carrier Contact” may result in your PII being sent 
to a third party, in order for the third party to contact You.&nbsp; You can decline 
to submit PII, in which case INTTRA may not be able to provide certain Services 
to you.</p>
<p>Your use of the Portal, INTTRA-ACT or INTTRA-LINK and the terms of this 
Privacy and Security Policy are governed by the law of the State of New York. 
You represent and warrant that any data You provide to INTTRA is submitted in 
connection with transactions conducted for business purposes only. Access to and 
use of the Portal is subject to this Privacy and Security Policy and to the 
Legal Terms and Conditions. Access to and use of ant password-protected or 
secure areas of the Portal, INTTRA-ACT or INTTRA-LINK is restricted to 
authorized Users only. Unauthorized individuals attempting to access these areas 
of the Portal, INTTRA-ACT or INTTRA-LINK will be subject to prosecution. By 
accessing, browsing, downloading, generating, receiving or transmitting any 
data, information or messages via the Portal, INTTRA-ACT or INTTRA-LINK you 
hereby accept for Yourself and on Your company's behalf, without limitation or 
qualification, this Privacy and Security Policy and the INTTRA Legal Terms and 
Conditions. If you do not accept this Privacy and Security Policy and the INTTRA 
Legal Terms and Conditions, do not use the INTTRA website or Services.&nbsp; INTTRA 
may at any time revise this Privacy and Security Policy, and You are bound by 
such revisions and should therefore periodically revisit this page for any 
changes to this Privacy and Security Policy.&nbsp; Any changes to this policy may 
apply to data obtained prior to the date of the change.&nbsp; In the event that we 
may feel it necessary to notify You of a breach of security relating to the 
INTTRA or related Websites, you agree that we may do so via a posting on the 
relevant Website(s), e-mail, or other means of communication.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
