# Interac

This Privacy Statement describes how Interac Association, Interac Inc. and Acxsys Corporation (collectively "we" or "us") collect, use and disclose personal information of visitors to our website and of individuals with whom we deal offline ("you" or "your").

## Your personal information

We do not collect your personal information unless you voluntarily choose to provide it by visiting our website and agreeing to the terms set forth for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.

## How we use and disclose your personal information

If you contact us and voluntarily provide us with your personal information, we may use it for the purposes for which it was provided, namely to establish your identity and respond to your questions, comments or concerns. Please do not include any of your banking or other financial information in your communications with us.

If you advise us that your query relates to a particular Interac Association member or a participant in Acxsys Corporation’s services we may, unless you instruct otherwise, disclose your personal information you provide to us to that organization so that it may respond to you directly. When providing your information to such organization, we will not include any banking or other financial information you may have included in your message to us.

## Website aggregate data

Our website collects certain information from visitors to our site, namely IP addresses, information regarding the type of Internet browser and operating system used, and the domain name of the website or advertisement from which the visitors have linked to our site (if applicable). We render this information anonymous and retain it in aggregate form to measure usage of the site, including but not limited to the total number of visits, average time spent on the site, and pages viewed, both in real-time, and within a certain historical time frame. We use this aggregated information to improve the content and user experience of our site.

## Consent

By visiting our website and/or by providing us with your personal information, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for the purpose for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Statement, as amended from time to time, or as identified by us at the time of collection. If you do not wish to have your personal information to be collected, used or disclosed in this manner, then please either (1) do not submit your personal information to us, or (2) exercise opt-out procedures described above or that may be offered at the time of collection. Subject to any legal restrictions and reasonable notice, you may withdraw your consent to our retention, use or disclosure of your personal information by contacting us at the address provided below. Where permitted by law, we may infer your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information, and we may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where required by law.

## Retention of personal information

We may retain personal information you voluntarily provide for the purpose of ensuring that your inquiry is adequately dealt with. Information we collect from visitors to our website is rendered anonymous and retained only in aggregate form for the purpose of statistical analysis. We will destroy, erase or render anonymous personal information no longer required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted, subject to any legal or business requirement to retain it.

## Security safeguards

We take precautions to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration, and misuse. Access to your personal information is restricted to those individuals whose job responsibilities require them to have access. The precautions taken to protect your personal information include physical, organizational, and technological measures. However, given that electronically transmitted data is not 100% secure, we make no warranties as to the security of any information that you submit to us electronically, which you do at your own risk.

## Other websites

Our website contains links to other websites owned and operated by third parties. The third parties who operate these sites may treat the collection, use and disclosure of personal information differently than we do. This could be the case even for those websites that carry the Interac trade-marks or logos or which may be framed by this website. We therefore encourage you to review the privacy policies of these websites before disclosing your personal information to any third party. We are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of companies or organizations to which our website may provide links.

## How to access or correct your personal information

In order to respond to your inquiries, we will establish and maintain a file of the personal information that you provide to us. Your file will be kept by us at the address provided below. Only our employees or agents who need to access your file in the course of their duties will have access to your file.

If you wish to request access to, or correction of, your personal information held by us, please write to the Chief Privacy Officer using the contact information provided below. Some information may not be accessed in certain circumstances, for example if it contains personal information of other persons or for legal reasons. To protect your privacy, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to, or making corrections to, your personal information.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement was last updated on March 24th, 2008. We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time and will post the latest version on our website in a timely manner. We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically so that you are aware of any changes.
