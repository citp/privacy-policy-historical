InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com Privacy Statement

In order to demonstrate our commitment to our visitors’ privacy, we disclose our information practices. We will keep to these practice guidelines on ALL occasions in our dealings with you. 

You won't find a long winded, attorney-driven, hard-to-understand Privacy Statement here. Simply put: 

We will NEVER distribute, share or sell any personal information we collect on our website to any third party.  
We will NEVER spam your email address. 

If you are interested, here are the details on information collection and use at InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com. 

Information Collection 

InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We collect information from our visitors at several different points. 

Newsletter  
If a visitor wishes to subscribe our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. We then send newsletters to visitor's email address. 

Autoresponder  
When a visitor requests information such as our free e-book, courses, etc, by sending email to our autoresponder, the visitor's email address is logged. The requested information will be sent out automatically. 

This includes not only filling up a form at our website. The same progress happens whenever a visitor sends email to our autoresponder, through a form at our site, using his/her own email client, from another website, from newsgroup... 

Order  
We, or our credit card processing partner, request information from customer on our order form. A customer must provide contact information (such as name, email address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the customer. 

Feedback form  
Visitors may communicate with us by filling out feedback form at our website. The feedback content itself together with related email address will be stored for our future reference. 

Communication  
Visitors may communicate with us by sending emails to our email address stated on our website. This includes, but not limited to, feedback, sales information, technique support, order enquire, etc. 

The communication content itself together with related email address will be stored for our future reference and for us to serve visitors better.

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address.

We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact us to request the removal of this information from our database. 

Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve visitor privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.

Business Transitions

Links  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

Surveys & Contests  
From time to time our site may request information from visitors via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the visitors (and subscribers, customers) therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 

Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless requested by law. 

Security  
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our order form asks customers to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our visitors’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 

If visitors have any questions about the security at our web site, visitors can send an email to:   
[webmaster@InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com](mailto:webmaster@InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com)

Children   
InternetHomeBusinessArticles.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe we have received any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below. 

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our visitors are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use visitors’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect visitor information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
