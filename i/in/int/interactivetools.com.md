We take your privacy very seriously. In order for you to better understand our data collection methods, we have compiled the following list:

**1\. Website Forms**

> When you fill out a form on our website we may require you to provide your e-mail address or other information. This information is used only to contact you. We do not make this information available to any third parties. 

**2\. Newsletter**

> If you elect to join our newsletter we will send you a notification once a month about new software releases, updates and special offers. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions on how to be removed from all future mailings. You may unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time and we do not make email addresses available to any third parties. [Click here](http://www.interactivetools.com/iforum/General_C1/Announcements_F10/) if you'd like to see some example newsletters. 

**3\. During Software Purchase**

> It is very important for us to keep accurate purchase records. During this process, we ask for information such as name, company name, e-mail address, etc. This data is used only to identify you in order to give you the full benefits of registration including free technical support and upgrade eligibility. We do not make this information available to any third parties. 

**4\. During Software Usage**

The registration process only sends the license information that you've entered (Company Name, Domain Name, Product ID) and information about the software installed (Program Name, Version, Install URL, Checksum). No other type of information is sent.
