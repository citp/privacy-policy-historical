		<p>interCLICK is a leading provider of targeted and optimized
digital marketing solutions for advertisers. In the course of
providing these services, interCLICK collects and analyzes the
online behaviors of consumers across its network of sites. It is
critical to interCLICK that consumers' privacy, rights and choice
are maintained during<br>
 this process.</p>

<p><img src="/media/4045/nai_logo1.gif" width="151" height="61" alt="NAI_logo1" align="left">Accordingly, interCLICK is
committed to following the privacy guideline in accordance with <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">NAI
privacy principles.</a></p>

<p>This document is intended to inform consumers how interCLICK
collects, maintains and processes information we collect in the
delivery of our network advertising services.</p>

<p><strong><span>What types of data does interCLICK
collect?</span></strong><br>
 On the interCLICK network, we collect non-personally identifiable
information (non-PII) such as web sites visited, content viewed, ad
interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses,
search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior.
Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>

<p><strong><span>How does interCLICK track consumer
behavior?</span></strong><br>
 Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that
allow sites to recognize the computer when you revisit the site.
Generally, sites use this cookie to provide services such as auto
login, information delivery, and to better understand how you are
interacting with the site. These cookies enable sites to customize
the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as
valuable and relevant to you as possible.</p>

<p>Like many websites, interCLICK sets a cookie on your computer
containing an anonymous identifier. This cookie allows interCLICK
to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of
providing better and more relevant advertising.</p>

<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may
not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full
advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may <a href="/footer-nav/opt-out.aspx" title="Opt-Out">click here to opt-out of data collection and
targeting cookies from interCLICK.</a> Please note that if you buy
a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt
out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.</p>

<p><strong><span>How does interCLICK use this
information?</span></strong><br>
 interCLICK has created a technology that uses any consumer
information to create anonymous consumer segments. For example,
consumers that demonstrate car buying behaviors are grouped into an
auto-buyer segment. These segments will be used to target and
optimize advertiser campaigns. interCLICK will never use this
information to identify, locate or contact consumers.</p>

<p><strong><span>Which data do we retain and for how
long?</span></strong><br>
 We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior for 90 days.
This data includes web sites visited, content viewed, ad
interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses,
search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior.
Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>

<p><span>What if I have questions about how my or other consumers'
data is being used?</span><br>
 We are more than happy to respond to any customer inquires about
privacy concerns. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interCLICK.com">privacy@interCLICK.com</a> or
the address below with any questions of complaints.<br>
<br>
 For more information, please see the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network
Advertising Initiative web site.</a></p>

<p><strong><span>What if I don't want to be tracked - interCLICK
Opt-out</span></strong><br>
 You can opt out of the targeted advertising delivered by
interCLICK by requesting an "opt-out" cookie (a blank cookie) by
interCLICK, which will prevent information from being uniquely
associated with your browser. This allows you to opt-out of the
interCLICK tracking system without erasing other cookies associated
with<br>
 your browser.</p>

<p>This opt-out means that interCLICK will not store information
unique to your browser behavior and will be unable to recognize
your browser from one visit to the next. Opting-out does not mean
you will not receive online advertising. However, because the
network is not able to uniquely identify your browser, interCLICK
is unable to deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage
patterns.</p>

<p>Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change
Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to
perform this process again.<br>

<p>To opt out of all NAI member networks' behavioral tracking,
please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">NAI opt-out page.</a></p>
