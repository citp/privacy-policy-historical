Last Updated: May 1, 2003

Hunteridge, Inc.

For all website properties of Hunteridge, Inc.

Hunteridge, Inc. strives to offer its website visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to
provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may
use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the
terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter,
or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.
Period."

How we gather information from users

How we collect and store information depends on the page
you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to
participate and the services provided. For example, you may
be asked to provide information when you register for
access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase.
You may provide information when you participate in
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms,
and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web
sites, Hunteridge, Inc. also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic
tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example,
we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or
use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store
your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-
enter that information each time you visit, or may control
the number of times you encounter a particular
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
additional technology, we may also gather information
through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not
to provide us with information, for example by setting your
browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may
be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be
asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may
not be able to customize the site's features according to
your preferences.

What we do with the information we collect

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to
enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content
and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share
your information with anyone.

Aggregated Information (information that does not
personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For
example, we may combine information about your usage
patterns with similar information obtained from other users
to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which
pages are visited most or what features are most
attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again,
this information does not include any Personally
Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected
Hunteridge, Inc.) to communicate with
you about your registration and customization preferences;
our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by Hunteridge, Inc. and
other topics we think you might find of interest. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Hunteridge, Inc.
may also be used for
other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests,
and other communications with you. Certain third parties
who provide technical support for the operation of our site
(our Web hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your information only as permitted
by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to
develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner
with other companies or businesses. In such transactions,
user information may be among the transferred assets. We
may also disclose your information in response to a court
order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably
required to do so by law, in connection with the collection
of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement
authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure in such cases.

Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements

Hunteridge, Inc. expects its partners,
advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our
users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For
example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or
view as part of a frame on a Hunteridge, Inc. page, certain content
that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
Hunteridge, Inc. you may be introduced to, or be able to
access, information, Web sites, features, contests or
sweepstakes offered by other parties. Hunteridge, Inc. is not responsible
for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the
applicable privacy policies of those third parties when
providing information on a feature or page operated by a
third party.

While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners
or other third parties may use cookies or other technology
to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve
information about you. For example, some of our advertising
is served by third parties and may include cookies that
enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a
particular advertisement before. Other features available
on our site may offer services operated by third parties
and may use cookies or other technology to gather
information. Hunteridge, Inc. does not
control the use of this technology by third parties or the
resulting information, and is not responsible for any
actions or policies of such third parties.

You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in
chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can
be collected and used by third parties without our
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond
the control of Hunteridge, Inc. and this
policy.

Children

Hunteridge, Inc. does not knowingly
collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from
or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If
we discover we have received any information from a child
under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that
information immediately. If you believe Hunteridge, Inc.
has any information from or about anyone
under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.

change this policy at any time. Please check this page
periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site
following the posting of changes to these terms will mean
you accept those changes. Information collected prior to
the time any change is posted will be used according to the
rules and laws that applied at the time the information was
collected.
