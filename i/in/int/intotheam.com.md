### Where We Share Your Information and Why

We have not and will not sell your information to a third party, ever. That would be a direct violation of our promise to keep your data safe and secure. We do, however, share some information with trusted partners who help maintain our privacy mission. They fall into a few categories:

**Shipping & Delivery**

We need to share information with our shipping partners so they can get your order to the right doorstep. We only work with highly respected delivery services like USPS, FedEx, UPS and DHL and share as little personal information as possible.

**Payment Processing**

We use third-party payment processing providers in order to take payments securely. This keeps your sensitive credit card and other payment information safe. We do not store your credit card information on our site.

**Fraud Detection Agencies**

We work with credit card reference and fraud detection companies to ensure the safety of our customers and our business from fraud crimes. This allows us to cancel fraudulent orders before the victim is affected.

**IT Companies**

We work with select third parties to improve our website technology and experience. We share limited information only when it is absolutely essential.

**Marketing Companies**

We work with third party companies for marketing features such as product reviews and email notifications. Any personal information that they use is limited and secure.

**The Emazing Group**

We are part of The Emazing Group of companies (INTO THE AM Clothing LLC, iHeartRaves LLC, EmazingLights LLC). When necessary, we share limited information in order to improve the shopping experience for all of our customers.

Outside of these groups, we only share personal data with companies approved by you. For example, if you choose to use a social media site to login or create an account on our store, then you must consent for that social media site to share clearly stated information with us.

We may also share anonymous, aggregated data with select third parties. This data does not contain any personal information and will not identify you amongst our other customers and website visitors.

### How Long We Keep Your Information

We retain your information as long as it is needed to provide services to you. This can include as long as you maintain a customer account with us or as long as needed to provide our customer support services - if you have a message history with us.

There are a few reasons we may retain your information for more or less time than the above-stated scenarios:

  * We are required by law (an existing regulation or one enacted in the future) to retain your information for a longer period or delete it in a shorter period.
  * You exercise your right to request that we delete all your information and we do not have existing legal obligations to hold on to it.
  * We enter into a legal claim or other proceedings that involve your information. This could include fraud, abuse, terms & conditions violations, or another type of legal dispute. We will then retain your personal information until the proceedings and any appeals have concluded.



### Marketing messages

If you gave us your clear consent, we may send you marketing messages via the following channels: email, text message, or Facebook Messenger. We will only send messages via the channel or channels that you agreed to receive messages through.

Every marketing message that you receive from us will contain clear instructions on how you can unsubscribe from receiving any future marketing messages via that channel. If you are unable to find how to unsubscribe from a specific channel or wish to opt-out of all marketing messages at once, please contact us at [support@intotheam.com](mailto:support@intotheam.com). We will ensure you are opted-out and removed from our marketing message system.
