						<p class="title">INTUIT UK PRIVACY POLICY</p>
						
						<p>At <strong>Intuit Limited</strong> ("Intuit"), we are committed to protecting your privacy and we developed this Privacy Policy to inform you as to how we collect, use and disclose your personal data. This Privacy Policy has been drafted to comply with the legal standards that currently exist in the United Kingdom, and will be modified as Intuit determines is necessary to satisfy or exceed legal requirements. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by notifying our customers, via the main Intuit Web sites (<a href="http://www.quicken.co.uk/">www.quicken.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.quickbooks.co.uk/">www.quickbooks.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.taxcalc.com/">www.taxcalc.com</a>), of a new or revised Privacy Policy. These modifications will only apply to personal data that you provide to us after the date of the modification, except as may be required by law.</p>
						
						<p>If you would like further information on this Privacy Policy or about Intuit's use of your personal data, we encourage you to contact Intuit's Data Protection Administration (see below). For details concerning your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998, and other applicable legislation, contact the Information Commissioner (<a href="http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/">www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk</a>).</p>
						
						<p><strong>What Is Personal Data:</strong><br>
						"Personal data" is data that can be used to identify you as an individual, and includes your name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and may include your email address. We collect your Personal Data through your purchase orders, product registrations or enquiries, as well as from third parties who have advised that they are authorized to share your personal data with us. </p>
						
						<p><strong>How Do We Use Personal Data:</strong><br>
						Certain personal data is required for us to supply products and services that you have requested, carry out an agreement with you or take any steps that you have requested. Examples of additional required uses of your personal data include: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Updating you as to the status of your order <br><br>
							</li><li>Alerting you to important product revisions or updates to an Intuit product/service you purchased<br><br>
							</li><li>Ensuring that you are properly registered to receive technical support <br><br>
						</li></ul>
						<p>In the event that you submit personal data by telephone, Intuit may monitor or record your call to: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide evidence of your order or transaction with us <br><br>
							</li><li>Ensure that we comply with relevant regulatory procedures <br><br>
							</li><li>See that quality standards or targets are being met <br><br>
							</li><li>Protect the interests of national security <br><br>
							</li><li>Prevent or detect crime or to investigate the unauthorised use of a telecommunications system <br><br>
							</li><li>Secure the effective operation of our telecommunications system<br><br>
						</li></ul>
						<p>In addition to the above uses, we may also use your personal data for the following additional purposes and direct marketing ("Additional Purposes") where you have given us appropriate permission: </p>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>To tell you about special discounts on Intuit products and services <br><br>
							</li><li>To advise you about new Intuit products and services <br><br>
							</li><li>To advise you about offers from other companies that Intuit feels may be of interest to you. (In these instances, Intuit forwards the offer to you but does not share your personal data with these other companies.)<br><br>
						</li></ol>
						<p>To help us improve our products and services and develop new ones, we may also create aggregate data that uses your personal data but in a manner that will not identify you as an individual.  For example, we may look at your address to help identify the total number of users of a particular product in a geographic area. Aggregate data is not personal data as it cannot be used to identify any particular individual. </p>
						
						<p>Occasionally, we may invite you to participate in a survey or provide additional personal data that will enable us to better understand and serve your needs. Any information request marked as optional gives you the freedom to decide whether to respond. Please keep in mind that all information you provide may be used to personalise and improve our customer service operations.</p>
						
						<p>Intuit may use certain third-party service providers to help us fulfil your requests.  For example, we may use third party service providers to process your credit card payments or ship to you a product that you ordered.  In these instances, these third-party service providers are under a contractual duty to restrict their use of personal data to the limited purpose(s) specified by Intuit, which at all times shall be consistent with this Privacy Policy.  Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will not be transferred to a third party for their independent use without your express consent.  Intuit may also transfer personal data to Intuit affiliated companies, including ones in other countries. These may be outside the European Economic Area and may not have adequate laws that protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. Where this is done, Intuit shall take necessary steps to adequately protect the information transferred. <strong>BY SUPPLYING PERSONAL DATA TO INTUIT YOU CONSENT TO ANY SUCH TRANSFER.</strong></p>
						
						<p>In addition, you should be aware that there are very limited instances under law in which we may be required to disclose the personal data of our customers. If such an instance arises, we shall only release that personal data as required by law.  </p>
						
						<p><strong>Marketing Materials:</strong><br>
						We want you to have control over the ways in which we will initiate contact with you to provide you with information and materials for the Additional Purposes ("Marketing Materials"). We will provide you with Marketing Materials by telephone and facsimile (as to individuals only) if you have previously notified us that you consent to receiving such calls or facsimiles. If you are a business and do not want to receive Marketing Materials by facsimile, just let us know. For those individuals that have previously notified us that they consent to receiving Marketing Materials by email, we shall restrict those emails to products/services that are similar to those in which the individuals have expressed an interest. If you want to give or withdraw your consent to receiving Marketing Materials in any medium, simply notify Intuit. (See "Privacy Policy Questions, Updating Your Personal Data and Preference Notifications", below.) If you advise Intuit that you do not want to receive Marketing Materials, Intuit shall not be able to provide you with information concerning special discounts and offers for which you may be eligible, or new products or services that may be of interest to you. Intuit does not use text messaging or automated calling systems to disseminate Marketing Materials.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Use Of The Intuit Web Site:</strong><br>
						Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to manage our Web sites, and to enable you to use certain Intuit products and services:</p>
						
						<p><a name="cookies"><strong>Cookies:</strong></a><br>
						A "cookie" is a small bit of data that gets stored on your computer RAM or hard drive when you access particular Web sites. If you accept cookies, your browser adds this data in a small file on your computer.

The setting that controls cookies can be modified on most browsers by clicking on "Tools" on the menu bar of the browser, then clicking "Internet Options," and going to the tab marked "Privacy" where you can specify how you want to manage cookies. Here are some examples of how Intuit may use cookies:</p>
						<ol type="i">

This information enables us to know what areas of the site users prefer and how users navigate through the Web site. We also use this information to group your online behaviour with other similar types of customers to learn more about those types of products in which you have an interest. If you do not accept these cookies and would like to purchase an Intuit product or service, you may complete your most transactions by calling Intuit at 0845 606 2161.<br><br>
							</li><li>Some of our Web sites may require users to register in order to use the online service.

This cookie authenticates the registered users' identity and permits them to access those portions of the site that are limited to registered users.<br><br>
							</li><li>Some of our software products require online activation or online download.  In these instances, cookies are required in order for us to authenticate the software, activate the software, confirm your eligibility to use the software, and/or to electronically provide you with the software and/or related updates.<br><br>
						</li></ol>
						<p><strong>Links to Non-Intuit Web sites:</strong><br>
						Our Web site may provide links from our Web site to third party Web sites. If you click on a banner advertisement or third party link, the "click" will take you off the Intuit Web site. Once you leave any Intuit Web site, any information that you provided to us remains with us and is not forwarded to the next site to which you have linked. Any personal data or other information that is collected by, or which you choose to provide any third party Web site will be subject to the privacy policy of the operators of the third party Web site. Intuit is not responsible for the use or protection of personal data you disclose to a third party Web site operator, even if reached from an Intuit Web site.  Any site that is an Intuit co-branded Web site will clearly identify both Intuit and the third-party, and any personal data or other information collected through these co-branded sites may be collected and used by both Intuit and the third-party unless otherwise stated on that co-branded site.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Protection of Personal Data:</strong><br>
						All personal data is collected and stored in a secure manner and is used strictly in relation to this policy and your stated privacy preferences. We employ industry recognized security safeguards to protect personal data that you have provided to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. When you transmit information to us such as a credit card or bank account number through the Intuit Web Site, we provide you access to our server that allows 128 bit encryption of that data as it travels across the Internet. However, under no circumstances, will Intuit be responsible or liable for loss of privacy, disclosure of information, harm, damage or loss that may result from your transmission of any information to us in any medium. </p>
