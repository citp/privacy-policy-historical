# Read our privacy policy. - Into Film

## Introduction and General Terms

Into Film is committed to protecting you and your family's personal information when you are using our services. We want our services to be safe and enjoyable environments for our audience. This Privacy Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us through the Into Film website.

In order to provide you with the full range of Into Film services, we are sometimes required to collect information about you.

We are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal information, including the Data Protection Act 1998

## The Data Protection Act

Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

What information do we collect?

We collect three kinds of information from visitors to the Into Film site:

1) Data you give to us when you sign up to the newsletter or contact us directly.

2) Data you give to us during the register, login process and feedback (through visitors emailing us) and anonymous site usage information using Google Analytics.

3) On occasion, Into Film will conduct competitions and surveys via an authorised data capture provider.

Any information collected via such service will be shared only with Into Film and used only for the purposes of the competition or survey. 

Into Film will only collect the participant's age, name, phone number or email address and will not share this information with any other third party. The exception to this is the Into Film Festival. If the cinema needs to call you in an emergency (regarding your attendance at an Into Festival event they are hosting), they may contact you. They will not contact you for any other purpose.

### Why do you need my date of birth when I set up an Into Film account?

Some of the content on the Into Film sites is only appropriate for certain age groups (e.g. booking tickets for the Into Film Festival is restricted to adults only) so we need your date of birth to verify your age. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

### Why do you need my mobile number when I set up an Into Film account?

We may need to contact you on your mobile if any notable problems arise with an Into Film event or service you have signed up to. (e.g. an Into Film Festival event you have booked or a Film Club you have set-up).

3) 'Accept' cookie: this tells us that a user has accepted that their anonymous information can be used as part of our analytics and statistics (as above).

4) Demographics and Interests cookie: this allows us to collect anonymous data on users by age, gender and interest categories. This helps us to target our communications more effectively to users.

5) We have some relationships with carefully-selected and monitored suppliers. They may also set cookies during your visit to be used for analysis and re-marketing purposes - to show you different products and services based on what you appear to be interested in.
