In addition, your message may also contain:

  *  **Other information**



As the forms include a free text field, you may provide personal data about other individuals in your message or in attachment, for instance information on wanted fugitives. The provision of such personal data is voluntary.

There are certain services accessible through the Site for which you need to register, such as the recruitment or procurement platform.

As these services are provided for a specific purpose, such as recruitment, you will find more information related to the data protection policies of those specific services prior to registering. 

### How do we process your personal data?

###  Do we disclose your personal data?

As a general rule, we will not forward your personal data to third parties without your prior consent. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances under which we consider ourselves required to disclose your personal data for:

  * the protection of your vital interests as well as those of other individuals;
  * the establishment, exercise or defence of the Organization against any legal claims or allegations; or
  * the protection and integrity of the Site and the services provided through the Site.



### How do we process data for purposes of international police cooperation?

If the data you provide pertains to information on criminal activities, threats or wanted fugitives, the data will be processed by the relevant crime units and/or forwarded to the National Central Bureau(s) of the countries concerned. We will process this data in accordance with INTERPOL’s Rules on the Processing of Data

  *  **What are your rights as a data subject?**



Your rights, as a data subject, in the context of police cooperation are set out in several of [INTERPOL’s legal instruments](https://web.archive.org/Who-we-are/Legal-framework/Legal-documents), including:

  * INTERPOL’s Constitution;
  * INTERPOL’s Rules on the Processing of Data;
  * Statute of The Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files.



The Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files is an independent oversight body. You are entitled, in the context of police cooperation, to file an application to access, correct or delete your personal data.

For more information on the Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files, please visit their [webpage](https://web.archive.org/Who-we-are/Commission-for-the-Control-of-INTERPOL-s-Files-CCF).

If your request pertains to a service on the Site for which you have registered, such as the recruitment portal, you may be able to access, amend and delete your personal data through the service.

### What happens when you click on a link to a third party website or application?

When you click on a link that redirects you to a third party website or application, such as our social media channels, INTERPOL is not responsible for the collection of your personal data on that website or application.

As a consequence, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and we would advise you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policy of the website or application you are accessing.

### How will you be informed of updates to this Policy?

In the event that we modify or update this Privacy Policy, we will clearly indicate the date of modification or update.

Changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately when this page is published.

If an update to the Privacy Policy pertains to a significant change to the way in which we process your personal data, we will provide you with a reasonable amount of time to assess the updated Privacy Policy and its impact prior to the Policy taking effect.
