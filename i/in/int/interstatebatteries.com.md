Information Collection and Submission

IB collects information to provide better services for all of its users. When you visit the Site, you acknowledge that you may be providing IB with two specific types of information: (i) information that you provide which personally identifies you or your business (“ **Personally Identifiable Information** ”) and (ii) information that you provide, or that we collect as you interact with the Site, which does not personally identify you or your business (“ **Site-Use Information** ”). 

_Personally Identifiable Information_. Throughout the Site, you may voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information that personally identifies you. For example, the Site may ask you to voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information if you register for the Site. Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, your (a) name, (b) company’s name, (c) department, (d) physical address, (e) phone number, (f) fax number, (g) e-mail address, and (h) billing information.

_Site-Use Information_. To help IB tailor the Site to the needs and interests of the Site’s visitors, IB may collect various types of Site-Use Information that do not identify you personally. For example, when you visit the Site, IB’s server, through the use of tracking devices, may collect Site-Use Information pertaining to you, including, but not limited to, the length of time you spend on the Site, which pages you visited within the Site, which site you visited before coming to the Site, and which site you accessed when you left the Site.

Cookies

IB uses various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our site, this includes the use of “cookie,” which is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes, or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. IB reserves the right to place these cookies in the browser files of your computer. You can configure your browser to refuse cookies, or to warn you before a cookie is placed. If you disable cookies, some parts of the Site may not function properly or at all.

Do Not Track

At this time sites on the IB Network do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‘do not track’ instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain or all cookies, or require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser. 

Security

IB works hard to protect its users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, destruction or disclosure of information we hold. IB uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, human, and physical measures to protect your information in IB’s possession against loss and theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, IB cannot guarantee that any electronic commerce is totally secure. For example, IB has no control over the information collected by your Internet service provider or your employer (if the Site is made available to you through your employer). Any such third party that collects your information may use the information in accordance with its terms and conditions of use (and related privacy policies), which may be different from this Policy. IB is not responsible for any information collected by such third parties and/or how such information is used or maintained. Neither any third party nor IB has the authority to make any representations or commitments on behalf of the other.

If you are accessing the Site from outside of the United States, any Personally Identifiable Information collected through the Site may be transferred to the United States or other countries whose privacy laws may be different from those of your home country.

## California: California Privacy Rights

California law permits customers in California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.

We may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us on the Service with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may opt out of such future sharing of your personal information (as defined by the California Shine the Light Act) and/or request information about our compliance with this law by contacting us at [insert email address]@ibsa.com or by sending a letter to Interstate Batteries, Inc. 12770 Merit Drive, Suite 1000, Dallas, TX 75251, United States (Attention: Legal Counsel).
