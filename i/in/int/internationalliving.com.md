# Privacy Policy - International Living

We take our commitment to protecting the privacy and security of our website users very seriously. We will never intentionally disclose personal information about you as an individual user, but please note that the Internet as a whole is not a secure forum. Exercise caution whenever disclosing information on any website.

Personal information will not be shared at any time without your permission and we will only collect this information on a voluntary basis. If you volunteer your personal information, we may use it to send you special offers or to contact you with answers to any questions or concerns that you may have. Users may, however, choose to opt-in to a service in order to receive future offers and information from International Living.

If you opt-in you may receive e-mails from us introducing new products and services that we think will be of interest to you. Some may be from companies other than Agora.

We reserve the right to use, without identifying you, any questions, comments or other information that is submitted. We guarantee that we will keep your personal identification information confidential if your information is used in books, articles, or promotions.

By using InternationalLiving.com you have agreed to accept our privacy policy. We reserve the right to change or modify InternationalLiving.com and its policies at anytime. By continuing to use the website you have agreed to any changes that have been made.
