We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

The information used for targeted advertising either comes from Intacct or through third party website publishers. If you would like to opt out of re-targeted advertising from Intacct that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please click [here](http://preferences.truste.com/truste/), or if located in the European Union, [click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).
