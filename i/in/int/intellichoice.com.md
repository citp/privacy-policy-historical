# Privacy Statement - IntelliChoice

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us at [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/). We want you to know that we gather certain types of information about those who subscribe online to publications that are a part of the Primedia family of products and services so that we can better serve your needs. It is important that you fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of this information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information. 

Remember, this policy applies only to [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/). When you leave our site via links to other sites, you should always check the privacy policies of such other sites as they may differ from ours. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [privacy@IntelliChoice.com](mailto:privacy@intellichoice.com) for clarification. 

What information do we collect?

We collect certain types of personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, age, type of car you're interested in, and other similar information, to respond to your questions, fulfill your requests, and provide content tailored to your interests. We may ask if you would like to submit certain financial information so we may submit that information to organizations offering automobile financing services; we do not provide such services directly and do not otherwise use that information, except in an aggregate, anonymous form. 

Advertisers at this site may also offer contests, sweepstakes, or other features where visitors may volunteer certain personal information. We do not control either the information third party advertisers collect or how it is used. [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link, including, and without limitation, online automobile purchasing and/or financing services. 

We also collect certain information automatically to help our visitors navigate the site, and to assist in developing content and information we believe would be of most interest. [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) collects a user's Internet Protocol (IP) address automatically. This is an identifier assigned to your computer that tells us information such as the type of browser and operating system you use to help facilitate your online experience at our site. In addition, we use cookies to track usage patterns at our site, and to control the display of ads. Cookies are alphanumeric information files that your web browser places on your computer when you visit a web site. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to accept them or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Cookies allow us to customize your user interface to speed up the navigation process and to make your visit more efficient and enjoyable. We may also use cookies to record your registration at our site or in one of our sweepstakes or contests. You may set your web browser to disable cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to personalize content and information for you, and some features of the site may not be available to you. 

We may use third party advertising companies to serve these ads. 

How is information used?

[IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure relative consumer interest in various services (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their adverting banner. In performance of these statistical analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information on individual users or subscribers is not included in these analyses. Survey and feedback information enables [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) to develop content and services of interest to our users and advertisers. We also use personal information (like your e-mail address) to respond to your requests. [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) may send out emails to users who have opted in for an online service to announce special offers, services and announcements from our site and/or advertisers. We perform those services for our advertisers, and do not share your personal information with them in providing these announcements. 

Remember, if you register for a contest or sweepstakes with one of our advertisers, you are providing personal information to the advertiser, not to us. You should check their privacy policy to be sure you understand how they may use your personal information. Cookies, in and of themselves, do not contain any personally identifiable information, but we will associate personal information (like your name) with cookie data in order to provide registered users with a personalized greeting and personalized updates reflecting the type of information you have indicated you are interested in. 

How is information shared?

[IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) shares the information it tracks, in aggregate form, with advertisers and other partners. Our ad server firm may have the ability to identify users by name or e-mail address; our agreement with them prohibits them from disclosing this information to any third party. We may occasionally make the list of postal addresses volunteered on its Web site via e-mail registration, contest, sweepstakes and surveys available to other carefully screened associations or companies whose products or services we think you may find of interest. We pre-screen all use of our information for our customers. 

Personal information is otherwise available only to members of the [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) and Primedia staffs, and their interactive, web and other consultants, who help us make this site and the content and services on it available to our visitors. Consultants and agents that provide technical and fulfillment services on our site (for example, to keep our site functioning, to respond to your questions or requests, to handle subscription questions, or to perform statistical analyses) may have access to personal information, but do so only to implement their responsibilities. They are not authorized to share or sell data to other third parties. 

Customer lists will be transferred in the routine case of an acquisition or transfer of ownership of the Company. We will not otherwise share personal information on individual subscribers or visitors with any third party, except to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, or to cooperate in any legal investigation. 

Opting out and accessing personal data

You may remove your name from our email mailing list by contacting us at [privacy@IntelliChoice.com](mailto:privacy@intellichoice.com). If you would like to access information we have about you, or correct or update it, contact us at [privacy@IntelliChoice.com](mailto:privacy@intellichoice.com). 

What about security?

We have internal procedures in place to limit access to and use of user personal information by employees of [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) and Primedia. At present, we do not sell products online, so we never collect your credit card information. While we strive to protect your personal information, neither [IntelliChoice.com](http://www.intellichoice.com/) nor Primedia can ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide or transmit to us. The Internet is not a secure medium. 

Your Agreement.

YOUR USE OF THIS SITE CONSITUTES YOUR EXPRESS CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. THIS POLICY IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE MANNER WITH WHICH WE HANDLE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, HOWEVER, WILL BE POSTED HERE BEFORE THEY GO INTO EFFECT. CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE REVISED TERMS.
