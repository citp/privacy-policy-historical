In order to administer and optimize our website for you and to diagnose problems, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. 

**Use Of Cookies**

Like most websites, our website uses cookies to keep track of your activities on our website to enhance your experience. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other personal and financial information so you do not have to reenter it each time you use our website.

**Information We May Collect From You**

In order to operate our website and to provide you with information about our services, such as providing _webcam jobs_ , recruiting webcam models, hiring webcam models, and other services that may be of interest to you, we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly without using our website), "demographic information" (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor financial information which may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, [webcam model](http://www.internetmodeling.com/) or agent application history information, and **webcam model** or agent login history information), subject to the rest of this paragraph. Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public information", which consists of browsing history information and one-on-one communications between you and agents of Internet Modeling; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other demographic information. We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your address or password as your username, or include your name or address in your public profile), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on our network, and the information will then be treated as "demographic information" that is "public information."
