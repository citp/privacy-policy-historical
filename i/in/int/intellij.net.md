## What we collect

What we collect depends largely on the interaction that takes place between you and JetBrains, most of which can be categorized under the following:

#### Purchasing JetBrains Software Products

When you purchase downloadable software or sign up for software as a service, we collect information to process your payment and create your customer account. This information includes name, email address, physical address, telephone number, and company name where applicable. We do not store your complete credit card details. All transactions and credit card information are handled by a third party that processes all electronic transactions. These are governed by their agreements, which can be found on Jetbrains.com under the section Third-Party Services. We retain the last four digits of your credit card number and its expiry date so you may identify that card used, for your convenience in future purchases.

#### Using JetBrains Downloadable Software

When downloading and installing purchased software, you need to provide the software with identifiable information such as your JetBrains Account or Licensing information which may include name, email and license key. On installation and execution, the software may send information which includes version, edition, operating system information and environment it is installed in (this is applicable to tools such as ReSharper ™ , which is a plugin to Visual Studio ™). A unique, randomly-generated ID, which does not contain any license or other personally identifiable information, is also used to distinguish instances. The software can also check for available updates, as well as available updates for plugins or components. In addition it can check for license validation, either using the license key or your JetBrains Account details. Some software products can also use license information to inform you of the availability of applicable updates.

When you opt in to anonymous data collection, the software will electronically send information to JetBrains related to your usage patterns of the application's features. This may include but not limited to, information such as frameworks, file templates being used in the IDEs, actions invoked, and other interactions with product features. This information will contain neither source code nor personally identifiable information, nor information about your JetBrains Account or Licensing information.
