  * Browsing information. This includes the URL that referred you to the iONE Digital Services, the areas within the iONE Digital Services that you visit, how long you spend on the iONE Digital Services, and the time of day of your visit.

We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit the iONE Digital Services, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device:

  * Cookies **.** A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
  * Mobile identifiers. We may use software development kits (“SDKs”) or mobile advertising identifiers (i.e., IDFA on Apple mobile devices or Advertising ID on Android mobile devices), which function similarly to cookies on mobile devices. You may reset your IDFA or Advertising ID in the settings on your mobile device.
  * Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs,” “one pixel GIFs,” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.

**4\. Rights of Minors**

Except where otherwise indicated, we do not knowingly collect or store any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at [ionelegal@interactiveone.com](mailto:ionelegal@interactiveone.com). As required by law, we will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

California minors under 18 years old may request the removal of any information that they post to the iONE Digital Services by contacting [ionelegal@interactiveone.com](mailto:ionelegal@interactiveone.com). Upon such request, iONE Digital will anonymize, or remove from public view, any content posted by a minor to one of its websites, unless required by law to retain such content or information.

**5\. Your Rights and Opt-Out Choices**

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information.

**Email communications**. When you receive promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional email you receive or by contacting us directly at ionelegal@interactiveone.com. Regardless of your indicated email preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding the iONE Digital Services, including, for example, notices of updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy.

**Update or delete your Account information**. If you wish to verify, correct, update or delete any of the Personal Information provided to us in connection with your Account on the iONE Digital Services, you may do so by editing it on your associated Account page. Please note that we may be required (by applicable law or otherwise) to keep the outdated information and not delete it (or to keep the outdated information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). You should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data remaining in our archives because of backups and other reasons.

**Opt-out of targeted advertising**. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information. Below are the steps you can take to opt-out of targeted advertising:

  * Visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page (http://www.aboutads.info/choices). The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have Cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
  * If you are using one of our mobile applications, you can download App Choices (<http://youradchoices.com/appchoices>), which will allow you to opt-out of in-app tracking. You can also adjust the privacy settings on your mobile device by visiting the settings tab. If you wish to opt-out of cross-device tracking, you will need to opt-out of in app tracking on all of your devices.
  * Update the privacy settings in the help section of your browser, or in the settings tab on your mobile device.
  * You may also click on the ad choices icon in the advertisement.
  * You may opt out of additional third party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative’s Website (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>) and following the directions provided.



Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.

Please note that even if you choose to remove your information or “opt-out,” you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online; however, those advertisements will no longer be tailored to your interests. Additionally, information regarding your usage of the online services may still be collected for research, analytics or internal operations purposes. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any such opt-out options.

**Do Not Track** **Signals**. iONE Digital does not currently take actions to respond to “Do Not Track Signals” because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

**Cookies**. The “Help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, and how to disable existing cookies. For more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, or restrict the categories of cookies you wish to accept, you can consult the information at [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit the iONE Digital Services. Please note, however, that without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all the iONE Digital Services and some parts of the iONE Digital Services may not function properly.
