**Privacy Policy**

The Intellicast.com (Intellicast) site is owned and operated by WSI Corporation (WSI). Intellicast believes that electronic privacy is crucial for the success of the Internet. The following sections detail how Intellicast.com collects user information and uses it to deliver personalized services.

**1\. Information Collected and Use**  
Intellicast collects personal information (such as name, e-mail address and zip code) when a user registers for the Intellicast weather e-mail service. This information is used for the primary purpose of sending customized e-mail weather planners, and to contact users for other Site-related purposes. Users may opt-out of receiving any future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

Optional demographic data (zip code, gender, income, etc.) are also collected as part of the registration process to compile demographic statistics about our users and display advertisements that match your interests and profile. Intellicast also collects information on interests such as golf, skiing, travel, and other recreational activities to customize weather planner e-mails and provide targeted advertising for these activities. This type of non-personally identifiable information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

**2\. Cookies  
**A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's hard drive that contains non-personal information about the user. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user, as the cookie is stored without any identifiable or encrypted information. In other words, if the cookie file were to be obtained by some means, there is no simple analysis that would lead to the e-mail address embedded in the cookie. If for some reason the user would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers will allow the user to reject cookies or choose which cookies to accept on a case-by-case basis.

Intellicast works with Real Media and DoubleClick to serve ads on our site. Some of these ads contain cookies that are used to track user behavior. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies set by Real Media or any other third party advertisers. Intellicast does not have control or access to the information contained in these cookies. For more information about how Real Media uses the information collected by these cookies, please review [Real Media's privacy policy](http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html). For more information about how DoubleClick uses the information collected by these cookies, please review [DoubleClick's privacy policy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp).

**3\. Opt-in E-mail Personalization  
**Intellicast uses the email registration information provided by the user to tailor the user's e-mail service as follows:

**a) Weather Planners**  
Intellicast's e-mail service uses the user-supplied zip code and interest selections to deliver local forecast information and lifestyle weather planners, respectively.

**b) Targeted Advertising**  
Intellicast's e-mail service is advertiser supported. Intellicast uses registration information to tailor advertising to the interests of individual users and serve local advertising. In addition, Intellicast uses registration information for analysis, modeling and comparison to enable Intellicast to attract advertisers, display advertisements that are suitable for individual users, and for the display of advertisements not served directly by Intellicast. 

**c) Direct Intellicast.com Communication**  
Intellicast uses registration information to contact users if necessary regarding user accounts or other user service issues. 

**d) Accessing and Modifying User Registration Information**  
Users can make changes to their user registration information or opt-out of the e-mail service at any time via the user profile form. To correct this information electronically the user should follow the "Update Profile" or "Unsubscribe" link provided in every e-mail deployed to the user from Intellicast or [click here](http://www.intellicast.com/WxMail/Edit/login.asp?link=update_profile).

**4\. Sharing the Information  
** Except as described in this privacy statement, Intellicast will never willfully disclose individually-identifiable information about any user to any third party, other than where such disclosure is related to the primary purpose for which the information was collected, without first receiving that user's permission. The individually-identifiable information that a user provides may be used within Intellicast to provide a personalized experience for that user.

**5\. Security  
**Access to computer data and files at Intellicast are secured by password-protected services and a firewall designed to prevent unauthorized access.

Intellicast gives users the following options: to remove their information from the Intellicast database, to not receive future communications, and/or to no longer receive e-mail weather planners. To correct this information electronically the user should follow the "Update Profile" or "Unsubscribe" link, which Intellicast provides in every e-mail it deploys to the user, or contact Intellicast at the address provided below.
