### Your Account

If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity. You acknowledge that Intellifluence is not responsible for third party access to your account that results from theft or misappropriation of your account. Brands, Influencers and Talent Agencies are required to adhere to the terms of the agreement specified within each transaction. This includes providing clear, concise communication in a timely manner to ensure both parties understand the progress of each transaction, up until the completion of the transaction. Intellifluence and its associates reserve the right to refuse or cancel service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole discretion if the terms of pitches, transactions, campaigns, Marketplace offers or the terms outlined within this Terms of Service section are not met or either party engages in (or is suspected of engaging in) a fraudulent manner. Any earnings, fees or credits acquired in a fraudulent or manipulative manner are subject to forfeiture in the sole discretion of Intellifluence.

As a condition of your use of the Site, you must adhere to all applicable laws in your jurisdiction. By participating in transactions involving alcoholic beverages and products, you swear and affirm and represent to us that you are over the legal age required to purchase alcoholic beverages in your jurisdiction and we will rely on the information you provide to us because if we are held liable for any reason if that is not true, you agree to indemnify us and/or reimburse us and be responsible for all costs, expenses (including legal fees) and damages we suffer or incur. We prohibit transactions involving drugs (legal or illegal), controlled substances and drug paraphernalia.

Intellifluence does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If you are under 18, you may use intellifluence.com only with permission of a parent or guardian.

We are committed to protecting our influencers and brands on Intellifluence from technical abuse and spam. Any accounts engaging in abusive behavior or spamming the system may be temporarily limited or subject to permanent termination.

Joining Intellifluence for the purposes of soliciting influencers for a competing product, network, platform, etc. is strictly prohibited and is subject to account deactivation at the discretion of Intellifluence.

All Intellifluence Users agree to adhere to the current Federal Trade Commission Guides Concerning the Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising (FTC Guides) at all times.

Brands are entitled to share unaltered Influencer-provided content (including reviews, endorsements and accompanying media) on third-party (and proprietary) platforms upon completion of transaction.

### Influencer Profiles

In order to accurately display your social media reach, Intellifluence uses OAuth to validate certain social media accounts when you sign up or add a new social profile.

OAuth allows Intellifluence to verify that you’re a real influencer as well as display your public social profile and audience reach so brands can see your public profile while your password is kept private.

Keep in mind we never have permission to post on your behalf or do anything else other than verify that you’re real, display your public social media profile(s) on your Intellifluence profile and calculate your total reach (so brands understand the value you offer).

In joining and using Intellifluence, you agree to only add your own personal social media accounts, blogs and websites to your profile (or accounts where you have express permission to manage as a Talent Manager). Misrepresenting yourself and/or your identity or social media profile is subject to removal.

### Community Standards

Intellifluence restricts the display of nudity or graphic sexual activity as some in our community may be sensitive to this type of content. We also restrict hate speech (which we specifically define as an attack on people based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease) and threats of violence or harm. All Users are expected to act in a civil manner and refrain from abusive or threatening behavior. We reserve the right to remove any content from User accounts that falls under (but is not limited to) this description. Repeat offenders may be removed from the system.

### International Users

If you access the Site from a location outside the USA, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws.

### Billing for Brands

Intellifluence for Influencers is a free service. Intellifluence for Brands is a subscription-based service. Your subscription to your Plan starts upon effective reception of your first payment. Your subscription is then automatically renewed, unless you decide to terminate it and close your account (using the link provided in your user interface).

The subscription rates for Brands are posted on intellifluence.com: please see the Pricing Page for the rates in force for the current month. Prices are quoted in US dollars and exclude VAT and/or any other applicable sales taxes, which are also payable if applicable. You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable, plus all related taxes. All payment obligations are non-cancellable and all monthly subscriptions paid are non-refundable. Annual subscriptions are refundable excluding any part used months and free months.

Intellifluence reserves the right to modify the fees and charges for using the its Services and to introduce new charges for it upon 30 days prior notice. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Intellifluence website or by email to the account holder.

### Payments

Intellifluence does not operate an escrow service. Instead, we provide a service which enables payments to be made with respect to a service provided, which we call Intellifluence Payments.

Subject to the terms of the campaign (and/or transaction), Brands are able to make a Payment, which will be stored in the brand’s account and cannot be claimed by the Influencer until the following conditions are met:

1\. The Brand and Influencer both agree that the funds can be received by the Influencer;  
2\. The Brand acknowledges that all required work has been completed by the Influencer in a satisfactory manner;  
3\. The Brand instructs us to pay an Influencer for the services provided pertaining to a campaign (or transaction);  
4\. If any dispute has taken place, a satisfactory outcome has taken place in the Influencer’s favor.

If either party elects to dispute aspects of the transaction, they may flag the transaction (see below for more details).

Intellifluence reserves the right to impose a minimum transaction amount for each transaction (detailed in our Payments information). This minimum transaction amount is subject to change.

We reserve the right to collect funds owed to us using legal means.

In using Intellifluence Payments, you acknowledge:

1\. Intellifluence is not a bank or licensed financial institution and we do not provide such financial or banking services;  
2\. We are not acting as a trustee or fiduciary in terms of funds or payments;  
3\. The amount of funds displayed in your account is not insured and is not a guaranteed deposit.

Intellifluence Payments utilizes Paypal for transferring funds. PayPal is a service that enables businesses and individuals to send money without sharing sensitive financial information.

Payments that are initiated with a credit card must be reported on Form 1099-K* by the payment settlement entity under section 6050W and are not subject to reporting on Form 1099-MISC.

In other words, if you receive payment from other companies via PayPal, they should not be sending you a 1099-misc, and your income should not be reported twice.

For more information on how PayPal handles tax reporting as well as some answers to frequently asked questions, [click here](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/common-1099-and-tax-related-questions-faq3405).

Brands may request and receive a refund of account balance, excluding promotional credits, uncommitted to existing transactions, minus transaction fees charged to Intellifluence.

Once a Payments transaction is initiated (the Payments-eligible pitch or offer from the Brand has been accepted by the Influencer), the Brand and Influencer involved in the transaction are required to complete the transaction per the terms of the agreement. Failure to comply will involve removal from the network and funds will be forfeited.

Once an Intellifluence Payments transaction has been initiated by the Brand and the Influencer, neither party is permitted to circumvent the mutually agreed upon terms of the Intellifluence Payments transaction. Failure to comply will involve removal from the network and funds will be forfeited.

### Flagging Transactions

If an Influencer does not approve of the product or service provided by the Brand, the Influencer may Flag the transaction in order to attempt to resolve the issue with assistance from Intellifluence Support. Similarly, if the Brand does not approve of the work completed by the Influencer, the Brand may Flag the transaction in order to attempt to resolve the issue with assistance from Intellifluence Support.
