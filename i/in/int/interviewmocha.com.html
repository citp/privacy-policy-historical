                        Interview Mocha provides individuals reasonable opportunity to access and update their personal information, subject to the qualifications noted below. You have the right to obtain confirmation from Interview Mocha that we have retained personal data about you, as well as a written description of the nature of that personal data, the purposes for which it is being used, the sources of the personal data and a list of the recipients with whom we have shared your personal data.

Interview Mocha reserves the right to charge a modest fee for providing you access to your personal information.<br><br>
                        Test Takers: Please note that test scores reflect a Test Taker's performance at a particular time, and neither your responses nor your score can be changed after the fact. Similarly, certain information which you provide in preliminary question forms completed prior to or following a test session are immediately disclosed to the Test Administrator. Upon a reasonable request, Interview Mocha will provide you an opportunity to access and update your personal information that we have on file. We recommend, however, that you follow up  with your Test Administrator as well to update the personal information held on file by that entity. Please check the Test Administrator's privacy policy for details on its information collection and use practices.<br><br>
