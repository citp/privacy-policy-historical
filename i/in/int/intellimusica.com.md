# Privacy Policy

*Hi, it’s Evan. Given the new G.D.P.R. regulations, I figured it was time to display a _privacy policy_. I’ve created it in three parts: What I’m consciously/purposefully collecting with your express concent — my security initiatives — and normal browser/internet functioning, e.g., cookies, etc. For the latter, I borrowed and edited wording from author Tim Ferriss’s Privacy Policy — as it’s clear and concise. 

**This is the data I collect consciously with your express consent**

-I use a company called **Tinyletter to publish my email newsletter**. Obviously people enter their email, and I collect it [as part of my email list](https://tinyletter.com/ehandyside). I send members of my email list notification when I post a new guitar tab. I do not use this email for any other purpose. These emails will never be abused or shared with anyone.

If you receive emails from me, and no longer wish to, you can unsubscribe with one click at the base of the email.

-My **Premium Members purchase and login through my paywall company Tinypass**. Tinypass is owned [by Piano Media.](https://piano.io/) When a Premium Member subscribes to my blog, I am only able to see their name, payment method (not details) and email. This info is only used by me when a Premium Member has a question about their account status.

If you’re Premium Member, and wish to unsubscribe from Intellimusica, you’ll do so through [your Tinypass dashboard.](https://www.intellimusica.com/goodbye/)

-If you **comment directly on this blog** , you’re prompted to enter your email address. This action is used to protect this Site from comment spam. Your email address is not displayed to the public. By default, your email is attached to the comment in the back-end (for my eyes only).

If you have left a comment directly on this blog, and would like your comment removed, email me at intellimusica@gmail.com. (This action will also remove the email address in the back end.)

**Implied consent (and no data collected)**

– **This website is an Amazon Affiliate**. If you click on an Amazon link (an purchase an item on Amazon) I’m paid a small % of the sale. In this case, all of your information is solely with Amazon. I’m not given any details other than what item was sold. These are sometimes referred to as Amazon Portals.

**My security initiatives**

This website is fully secure HTTPS site. The bulk of my security comes from my excellent hosting company, [pair Networks.](https://www.pair.com/) Their security includes: threat detection and blocking, malicious web application blocking, proactive security maintenance, and plug-in security monitoring.

My additional layer of security comes from 24/7 monitoring by Sucuri, Jetpack, and Wordfence.

Premium Members login through Tinypass/Piano Media which employs the highest security measures available.

Below is text that I borrowed from [author Tim Ferriss’s Privacy Policy](https://tim.blog/privacy-policy/). I’m a fan of his, and liked his wording on what I qualify as normal internet/browser functioning. I edited it down to what might pertain to this site, Intellimusica.
