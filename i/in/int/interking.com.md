1\. Why does Kingdom Classifieds require registration to place ads?   
          Kingdom Classifieds requires that you register for an account to place ads.  Registration is free.  The account system helps us to credit your account properly (if you order a paid ad), while streamlining the process of placing multiple ads -- all you need is a username and password rather than re-entering all of your information again.

2\. What information is collected by Kingdom Classifieds and why?   
          When registering for an account, you are asked for your first and last names and a valid email address.  We contact you by email to confirm your registration and when you place ads.  We will also send you periodic newsletters if you've subscribed to our newsletter service.  You will choose a username and password at the time of registration, to be used for placing ads, as well as for logging into you account to view, edit, or manage your ads.  All of this information is kept private and will not be displayed on your ads or anywhere on the Kingdom Classifieds website.

          When actually placing an ad, you will be asked for information relating to the specific ad that you are placing, including contact information such as phone number, address, or email address, but these fields are optional.    

3.  What about credit card/financial information?   
          When purchasing a paid ad package, one of your options for payment is by credit card. We do our best to ensure a secure transaction by using the latest encryption technology.  All transaction of credit card information is performed via secure socket layer (SSL) technology, with digital security certificates from Verisign*.   

4.  Is the information shared with any other party?   
          The information that you provide during account registration is collected and stored in a database by Kingdom Classifieds ([http://www.interking.com](http://www.interking.com/)) The information is internally used solely for the purpose of user account log-in and administrative functions such as proper crediting of paid ad accounts.  **Your name and email address are NOT shared, sold, or made public in anyway.   **Your email address may, however, be revealed if you respond to a user that replies to your ad.

5\. What can I do to maximize my security at Kingdom Classifieds?   
          In general, user security is not an issue at the Kingdom Classifieds website.  No personal or sensitive information is shared on the website unless you specifically include that information in your ad.  Your real name is never revealed by us.  All information is provided by you, the user, at your discretion.  We do suggest, however, that you provide on your ads only the contact information you feel comfortable giving.  An example may be a business email address or phone number, and perhaps the 'city, state' location of the business.  Furthermore, do not share your password.  We do not ask for your password at anytime.

6\. General information about online privacy.   
          Most e-commerce websites advocate consumer privacy and do their best to uphold the privacy of Internet users.  Kingdom Classifieds is no exception to this rule. As mentioned above, we do NOT share user information, nor do we make this information available online.  One aspect of privacy is the theft of sensitive financial information.  You should use only one credit card to make all your purchases on the Internet.  Be sure when entering credit card information that you are on a secure page (a closed lock symbol on your browser status bar, and the web address starts with "http ** _s_** ://").
