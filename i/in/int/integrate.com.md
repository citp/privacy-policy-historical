Integrate may use session cookies and persistent cookies for the purpose of tracking various data points. Use of these cookies can also help to speed your access to the Website as they serve as 'reminders' as to who you are to our programming.

We work closely with trusted third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, and fraud protection services) and may receive and combine this new information with information we already have about you. We use this data to update and analyze our records, and to provide products and additional services that you may be interested in.

### **Updating Your Personal Information**

You may, at any time, update or edit your profile information and email preferences by sending a request to [privacy@integrate.com](mailto:privacy@integrate.com).

Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure: European Union and Swiss individuals have the right to access personal information about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal information. If you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please email Integrate privacy team at privacy@integrate.com or send a written request to the contact information provided below.

### **Disclosure of Personal Information**

a. Integrate will not rent or sell your personal information to others but may disclose personal information with third-party vendors and service providers that work with Integrate. We will only share personal information to these vendors and service providers to help us provide a product or service to you. Examples of third parties we work with are call center operators, shippers, servicers, information processors, financial institutions, data appending and surge scoring companies. These third parties only have access to personal information necessary for them to complete their service.

b. Integrate provides both personal and non-personal information to subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on behalf of Integrate. Integrate may use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill Users for transactions, and a credit scoring company to determine business credit scores (when applicable, for extending credit terms to Users upon request). At all times, these parties are required to agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we deploy reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.

c. Integrate reserves the right to disclose personal and non-personal information that is believed, in good faith, to be appropriate or necessary for the purpose of providing Services. Other causes of release of data may be due to, but not limited to: (i) taking precautions against liability issues; (ii) to assist government enforcement agencies; (iii) to investigate and defend Integrate against third party claims or allegations; (iv) to protect the security or integrity of the Website and/or Services; and/or (v) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Integrate or others.

d. Integrate does not share personal information with other non-affiliated third-party companies for their commercial use or marketing use without your consent, except as part of Services.

e. Integrate shares non-personal information, such as anonymous user data and traffic data, with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns and trends analysis for certain content, advertisements, promotions, services, and/or functionality of our Websites.

f. Integrate may release any information available if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with law or the powers of government enforcement agencies. Other causes for release of information could be for needs to comply with copyright laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, and/or search warrant.  We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

g. Integrate’s accountability for personal information it receives pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield (“Privacy Shield Principles”) and subsequent transfer of that data to third parties is detailed in the Privacy Shield Principles.  Integrate may be liable pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles if said third party agents claim that Integrate processes personal information in a manner inconsistent with pursuant to the Privacy Shield principles, unless Integrate can demonstrate that it is not responsible for the act or omission giving rise to the damage.  In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received, pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles, Integrate is potentially liable.

### **EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework**

Integrate complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.  Integrate has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

By providing information to us, you acknowledge that we operate in the US and you agree to permit us to transmit and use your user Information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to provide you with Services that such use by us shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy.

In compliance with the US-EU and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Integrate commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Integrate at:

Integrate has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit _http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacyshield/for-eu-consumers_ for more information and to file a complaint.

Finally, as a last resort under the Privacy Shield Framework, and under limited circumstances, individuals with unresolved complaints may invoke binding arbitration before a Privacy Shield Panel.

### **Data Security**

Integrate utilizes commercially reasonable physical, technical, and managerial safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of personal information and to protect it against unauthorized access or use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction and accidental loss. However, Integrate cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Integrate or place upon the Website and you do so at your own risk. This is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, altered, disclosed, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Personal information may be transferred outside Integrate to data processors, but they will only act on our instructions to provide the necessary services.

### **California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits individual California residents to request certain information regarding Integrate's disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to [privacy@integrate.com](mailto:privacy@integrate.com).  Please include your name, mailing address, and email address if you want to receive a response by email. Otherwise, we will respond by postal mail within the time required by applicable law.

If you are a California resident under age 18 and are a registered user of any of the services, then you may request that we remove any content that you created and publicly posted on our website ("User Content").  To request removal of your User Content, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific Data User Content to privacy@integrate.com. Integrate reserves the right to request that you provide information that will enable us to confirm that the User Content that you want removed was created and posted by you.

Integrate will make a good faith effort to delete or remove your User Content from public view as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note, however, that your request that we delete your User Content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Content. Your User Content may remain on backup media, cached or otherwise retained by Integrate for administrative or legal purposes or your User Content may remain publicly available if you or someone else has forwarded or re-posted your User Content on another website or service prior to its deletion. Integrate may also be required by law to not remove (or allow removal) of your User Content.

### **Children's Privacy**

Integrate complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and does recognize the responsibility to protect the privacy of young children at all times and to the best of everyone's ability. For that reason, Integrate does not knowingly collect or maintain any information via the Website from persons under the age of thirteen (13), and no part of our Website is directed to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If an underage person provides such information and Integrate has unknowingly collected said information, then Integrate will take the appropriate steps to delete this information immediately.

### **Transfer of Rights**

Should Integrate be acquired, merged, or endeavor to become closed for business, Integrate reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information collected, during the due course of business.
