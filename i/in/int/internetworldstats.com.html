INFORMATION COLLECTED</b></font><font face="Arial" color="#000099"><br>
 While visiting the Miniwatts Marketing Group Web sites
(collectively, the "Site"), or participating in a promotion or
newsletter subscription sponsored by any Miniwatts Web site, we
may ask you to register and/or provide information that
personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes
of interacting with the Site. Such Personal Information may
include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street
address, e-mail address, city and country. On any page that collects
Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information
is required in order to provide you with the product or service,
enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your
inquiry or comment.<br>
<br>
 <b><br>
 IP ADDRESSES</b><br>
 Miniwatts records and logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on

 Yes, you may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by
selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However,
portions of the Site which require registration will not be
accessible to you. In such cases, we ask that you register and
provide us with basic information on our registration page, or
sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable our server to
know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need
for you to log in each time you access our Site.<br>
<br>
 <b>WHAT ARE WEB BEACONS?</b><br>
 Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel or clear-pixel gifs)
are invisible images that are used to write cookies or access the
cookies we have written previously or to access information about
the page you are viewing for the purposes of recognizing our
returning users and analyzing traffic patterns. A Web beacon
cannot access cookies sent by other Web sites or the information
contained therein.<br>
<br>
 We use an advertising server developed by a third party to
display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies or
Web beacons that are sent by third parties (e.g. advertising
partners or advertising clients). We do not have access to these
cookies or Web beacons or any information that the cookies
contain. We encourage you to contact the advertiser or its
privacy policy for more information on their data collection
practices. Links from other Web sites that appear on the Site may
also use cookies or Web beacons, but we do not control such
activities. We also use Web beacons to write cookies, to access
the cookies that we have written previously, and to access
information about the page you are viewing, in order to recognize
our returning users and analyze traffic patterns.</font><font face="Arial"><b><br>

 Our Sites may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and
