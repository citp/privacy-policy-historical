Privacy Statement

Your privacy on intertechtraining.com

This website is administered by Intertech Training. The primary purpose of intertechtraining.com is to give you a tool for learning and provide information about our training services. Our goal is to make you feel secure when visiting our site.

The following provides an overview of how we protect your privacy during your visit.

What information do we gather?

Information on intertechtraining.com is gathered indirectly through our technology and by what you provide. Internet addresses are stored in our access logs. Cookies are used to indicate repeat visitors and, if you are a logged in user, allow us to recognize you without requiring another log in. You can turn cookies off on your browser.

How do we use this information?

We use information collected to help us determine where users come from, how they move through our site, and if they are registered how we can customize our site to your needs.

Will we share this with outside parties?

The data we collect is transferred within Intertech. We do not directly sell individual information to outside parties. Occasionally, you may receive free offers or discounts from select partners. In this case, your e-mail or other information is still not shared with the outside party.

Do we give you access to your information?

If you have entered your personal information into our system by creating a log in, you can view and modify all of your data. If you are having trouble, you can contact us at [info@intertechtraining.com](mailto:info@intertechtraining.com)

What about data security?

We take appropriate redundant steps to ensure data security on intertechtraining.com. The open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.

If you have any questions, contact us at [info@intertechtraining.com](mailto:info@intertechtraining.com)
