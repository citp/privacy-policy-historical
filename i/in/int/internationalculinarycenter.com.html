Users are able to sign up to receive separate regular emails about L'Ecole by providing their email address within the L'Ecole section. Members of the press may also do so within the Press area to receive any press announcements via email. As the press email list is limited to members of the press only, users must provide their name, publication and email address at sign up. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Applying to The International Culinary Center</span><br>
    When applying for any program at The International Culinary Center through the online application, users must provide contact information, educational and work history and financial information (credit card number, expiration date).

    We do not sell or rent your contact information to third parties except when required to disclose such information by law or in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or authority. The International Culinary Center uses contact information to send the user additional information about our schools and partners. A user's contact information may also be used to contact the user directly.
      <p> The International Culinary Center does not seek to solicit information from anyone under the age of thirteen (defined as a child). If a child submits information to us and we know that the person submitting the information is a child, we will not use it for any purpose. We will delete the information as soon as we discover it and we will not disclose it to third parties. 
    </p></li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Third Party Intermediaries</span><br>
    We use outside companies to mail some promotional material via email and post . These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="ip">IP Address</a></span><br>
    We log all connections to our web servers. Those log files include your IP address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet Service Provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the site. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="cookie">Cookies</a></span><br>
    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about their computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. So, while the user session will be tracked to give us an idea of what parts of the site a user is visiting, the user will remain anonymous. If a user rejects cookies, they may still use our site.
      <p> We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. We may use cookies to: 
      </p><p> Keep count of your return visits to our site 
      </p><p> Accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on web site usage 
    </p></li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Deliver content specific to your interests</span><br>
    We do not use cookies to identify, monitor or track any personally identifiable information. Our cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about you. We do not merge or associate our cookie information with any personally identifiable information we obtain. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="files">Log Files</a></span><br>
    Like most standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Links</span><br>
    The International Culinary Center web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site, www.internationalculinarycenter.com. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="security">Security</a></span><br>
    The International Culinary Center takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
      <p> When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry standard encryption software - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 
      </p><p> While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are also maintained in a secure environment. 
      </p><p> If users have any questions about the security at our web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:ahrnciar@frenchculinary.com">ahrnciar@frenchculinary.com</a>. 
    </p></li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="privacy">Notification of Changes</a></span><br>
    We will notify all users if there are any material changes to our privacy policy. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active email consent from the user if frenchculinary.com is going to be using the information collected from the user in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection. All changes to our privacy statement will be posted prior to a change. </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="contact">Contact Us/Opt-Out/Update</a></span><br>
    To remove or change your contact information in our database, or to not receive future mailings or other communications, as well as for all other inquiries, please contact us at any time using one of the options below:
