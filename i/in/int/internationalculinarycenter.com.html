  <li><span class="adm_b">Applying to The International Culinary Center</span><br>
    When applying for any program at The International Culinary Center through the   online application, users must provide contact information, educational and work   history and financial information (credit card number, expiration date). This   information is used for billing purposes and to enroll the user. If we have   trouble processing the deposit payment, the information is used to contact the   user. We may also email the applicant about related programs or special events   being offered by The International Culinary Center or partners. If you wish to   be removed from these mailings, please follow the instructions at the bottom of   each email or use the contact information provided in the section “   Opt-out/Remove” below. <br>&nbsp;</li>

    We do not sell or rent your contact information to third parties except when   required to disclose such information by law or in response to a request from a   law enforcement agency or authority. The International Culinary Center uses   contact information to send the user additional information about our schools   and partners. A user's contact information may also be used to contact the user   directly.<br>
    <br>
    The International Culinary Center does not seek to solicit   information from anyone under the age of thirteen (defined as a child). If a   child submits information to us and we know that the person submitting the   information is a child, we will not use it for any purpose. We will delete the   information as soon as we discover it and we will not disclose it to third   parties.<br>&nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Third Party Intermediaries</span><br>
    We use outside companies to mail some promotional material via email and post.   These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable   information for any secondary purposes.<br>&nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="ip">IP Address</a></span><br>
    We log all connections to our web servers. Those log files include your IP   address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general   information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet   Service Provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our   server and to administer the site. <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="cookie">Cookies</a></span><br>
    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information   about their computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally   identifiable information while on our site. So, while the user session will be   tracked to give us an idea of what parts of the site a user is visiting, the   user will remain anonymous. If a user rejects cookies, they may still use our   site. <br>
    <br>
    We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the   session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates.   A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an   extended period of time. We may use cookies to: <br>
    <br>
    1. Keep count of your   return visits to our site <br>
    <br>
    2. Accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate,   statistical information on web site usage <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Deliver content specific to your interests</span><br>
    We do not use cookies to identify, monitor or track any personally identifiable   information. Our cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally   identifiable information about you. We do not merge or associate our cookie   information with any personally identifiable information we obtain.<br>&nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="files">Log Files</a></span><br>
    Like most standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet   protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),   referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to   analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and   gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not   linked to personally identifiable information.<br>&nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b">Links</span><br>
    The International Culinary Center web site contains links to other sites. Please   be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other   sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read   the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally   identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information   collected by this web site,  <a href="www.internationalculinarycenter.com">www.internationalculinarycenter.com</a>, and <a href="www.frenchculinary.com" target="_blank">www.frenchculinary.com</a>. <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="security">Security</a></span><br>
    The International Culinary Center takes every precaution to protect our users'   information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their   information is protected both online and off-line. <br>
    <br>
    When our   registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as   credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted   and is protected with industry standard encryption software - Secure Sockets   Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on   the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet   Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when users are just   'surfing'. <br>
    <br>
    While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information   online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.   All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The   servers that store personally identifiable information are also maintained in a   secure environment. <br>
    <br>
    If users have any questions about the security at   our web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:thill@internationalculinarycenter.com">Tara Hill</a>.  <br>&nbsp;  </li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="privacy">Notification of Changes</a></span><br>
    We will notify all users if there are any material changes to our privacy   policy. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or   active email consent from the user if <a href="www.internationalculinarycenter.com">www.internationalculinarycenter.com</a>, or <a href="www.frenchculinary.com" target="_blank">www.frenchculinary.com</a> is going to be using the information collected from the user in a manner   different from that stated at the time of collection. All changes to our privacy   statement will be posted prior to a change. <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="adm_b"><a name="contact">Contact Us/Opt-Out/Update</a></span><br>
