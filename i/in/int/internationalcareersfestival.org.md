**Navigation data**

The information systems and software procedures relied upon to operate this web site acquire personal data as part of their standard functioning; the transmission of such data is an inherent feature of Internet communication protocols.

These data are only used to extract anonymous statistical information on website use as well as to check its functioning; they are erased immediately after being processed.

**Data provided voluntarily by users**

The so-called session cookies used by this website make it unnecessary to implement other computer techniques that are potentially detrimental to the confidentiality of user navigation, whilst they do not allow acquiring the user’s personal identification data.

**OBLIGATORY OR OPTIONAL DATA PROVISION**

Subject to the specifications made with regard to navigation data, users are free to provide the personal data either to be entered in the application forms submitted to the Owner or referred to in contacting the Owner to request delivery of information materials and other communications of a promotional nature.

Failure to provide such data may entail the failure to be provided with the items requested.

**PROCESSING ARRANGEMENTS**

Personal data is processed with automated means for no longer than is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it has been collected.

Specific security measures are implemented to prevent the data from being lost, used unlawfully and/or inappropriately, and accessed without authorisation.

**PERSONS OR CLASSES OF PERSONS TO WHOM THE DATA MAY BE DISCLOSED**

The user’s data could be communicated to people or operated contractually linked to the owner (such as service centers, Internet and telecommunications operators, employees and contractors) and will be brought to the attention of those responsible (if appointed) and by those entrusted designated by the owner and by the above-mentioned persons.
