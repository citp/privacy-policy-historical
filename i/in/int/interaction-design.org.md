# Privacy policy - Interaction-Design.org: A site about HCI, Usability, UI Design, User Experience, Information Architecture and more..

Your privacy is respected.

I do not share email addresses, obtained via communication with visitors, with anyone. Neither will any identifying data be disclosed to any third party for any purpose. Data I collect through logging visits to Interaction-Design.org (orginating IP, referral data, browser and platform type, traffic flows, geographical area of request, etc.) is only used in an aggregated form, which means I will not make any effort to identify users of Interaction-Design.org. The data is only used for server administration, fault finding, site improvement, etc. - as is done on most websites.

Aggregate (and thus completely non-identifying) statistics generated from these logs may be reported as part of research results or may be published on this site as a curiosity. 

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g. name, email address) on the comment section of a page on Interaction-Design.org, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the your communication, can be collected by third parties (which may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties). Such activities are beyond the control of Interaction-Design.org, but to protect your email address from being collected by spam bots, it is disguised as mads(at)interaction-design(dot)org 

If you have any questions regarding privacy, please [contact me](https://web.archive.org/contact.html).
