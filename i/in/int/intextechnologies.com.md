# Privacy Policy : Intex Technologies

### Your privacy is important to us. To know more on how INTEX works to maintain this, read below.

**We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)**

We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

**Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:**

Like most website operators, Intex collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Intex's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Dribbble's visitors use its website. From time to time, Intex may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

Intex also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Intex does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
