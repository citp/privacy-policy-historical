For example, like many web sites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our web sites. This may include individual and aggregate visitor preferences and session information, as well as information such as your IP address and the browser you are using. Our use of cookies is described in greater detail in the following section.



If you become a customer of our service, we may send you service–related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so.

**What Are Cookies and How Does Zeta Interactive Use Them?**

A cookie is a text–only string of information that a web site transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Many cookies last only through a single session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them. Cookies can help a web site to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly and also to improve the user experience. Most major web sites use cookies.

Web beacons may be used to monitor web site traffic in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1–pixel by 1–pixel in size. We may place Web beacons on our web pages to collect data about visitors. When a user requests a Zeta Interactive web page, a web beacon may be retrieved/activated. Once the Web beacon is retrieved/activated, it points to an external site to retrieve the image. At that time it can also pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the image. This information can then be compiled and made available to Zeta Interactive. Web beacons, along with cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on the Zeta Interactive site. Turning off the browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but personal information will not be recorded (information on how to “turn off” cookies provided below).

**How Does Zeta Interactive Use Cookies?**  
We use cookies for a number of purposes–for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our web site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a username or encrypted customer identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our site. Our cookies are not used to gather personally identifiable information.  
How Can I Prevent the Use of Cookies? You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable or delete cookies altogether. However, please note that if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online services or web site features.
