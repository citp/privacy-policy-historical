**How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?**

Your first and last names are used as a greeting when you log in and log out of inthecrack.com. We may also use your first and last names to assist in looking up your inthecrack account activity in our database. All required and optional information that you provide, including your name, address, city, country, zip/postal code, and email address, will be forwarded to our credit card processing company (CCBill) whenever you make a purchase. This means that every time you make a purchase on inthecrack.com your personal information will already be filled out when you get to the CCBill page. The optional information you may provide is kept in our database in order to streamline the purchasing process and is not used for any other purpose. Your email address is used to send your assigned randomly generated password to you. Your email address is also required in order for the "forgot password" feature of this site to work. If you have forgotten you username or password you will need to enter your email address or username in the "forgot password" page in order to retrieve your password. For security purposes the retrieve password instructions must be sent to your email address so that no one else can access it. 

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**

The only third party we share your information with is CCBill when you make a purchase. We do not share or sell your personal information to any other third party whatsoever. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security**
