# Privacy Policy | Interoute

**1\. Introduction**

Interoute Communications Limited takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes how and why we obtain, store and process data which can identify you; how you can instruct us if you would prefer to limit the use and disclosure of that information and the procedures we have in place to safeguard your privacy. We may update this policy from time to time and shall indicate on the web site when changes have been made.

**2\. The Information we collect**

Information is collected from you when you register with us, or when you contribute to or use some of the advanced features on the site. The information we collect is clearly set out on the web page on which we collect it. See for example our enquiry form. In addition, we may collect your IP address and use cookies unless you configure your web browser not to accept them. By providing us with information about yourself and by using this website, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy and consent to our use of cookies.  Further information on the type of cookies we use can be found in our Cookies Policy.

**3\. Why we collect it**

We may collect information about you in a number of circumstances including: 

  * so that we can personalise your use of the site, assist your use of the site and improve the site generally;
  * when you make an enquiry on any area of our website;
  * when we provide services to you;
  * when you apply for employment.     



Your personal information may also be used by us to send you information about additional products, services and offers. You may choose not to receive such messages at anytime.  
We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purpose of monitoring website usage in order to help us improve our website and our services.

**4\. Who we disclose it to**

We will take appropriate measures to keep your information confidential and secure in accordance with our internal procedures covering the storage, access and disclosure of information.  All online transactions are conducted using a secure web address and we do not personally hold any card details.

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, on a confidential basis for our internal administrative, billing and other business purposes.   We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed to aggregate information) to third parties to enable us to perform services requested by you or with your prior consent or where we are legally obliged to do so.

If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in such case personal information held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets.

**5\. Transferring information**

Where your order or business purpose requires the transfer of information about you between countries outside the EEA which may not provide the same level of data protection, you consent to your information being transferred to such countries.

**6\. Data Protection**

Interoute Communications Limited is registered with the Information Commissioner in the UK as a “data controller” in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Further details of the registration are available at [www.dpr.gov.uk](http://www.dpr.gov.uk/).

**7\. Security**

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us and certain sections of the site may encrypt data using SSL or a comparable standard. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.

Where you have a password and account details, you are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your password and user account details and you should not share this information with any other person.  You may not transfer your account to anyone without our prior written consent. 

**8\. Accessing and updating**

You have the right to apply for a copy of the personal information we hold about you, and to request to have any inaccurate personal information about you corrected. You also have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. Where we intend to use your data for such purposes or intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes, we will usually inform you before collecting your data.

**9\. Questions?**

If you have any questions or complaints relating to this Privacy policy or how we use the personal information we have about you, please contact [info@interoute.com](mailto:info@interoute.com). We will endeavour to respond to you promptly.

**10\. Additions**
