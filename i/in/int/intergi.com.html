    <div class="content"><p>Intergi is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing.</p>
<p>How We Protect User Privacy and the Property of Advertisers and Web Publishers</p>
<p>Intergi strategically places and serves ads to the partner websites it represents. The cookies utilized across our sites serve a quantitative function and are not designated to collect and store data profiles on users. Rather, they are employed only to:</p>
<p>- Report to INTERGI's advertisers and website clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign.<br>
- Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user.<br>
- Ensure that ads correspond to the correct click-through destination.<br>
- Deliver a series of ads in the proper sequence.<br>
- Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement.</p>
<p>Unlike other global ad serving companies, Intergi does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above. INTERGI does not merge personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information, and does not otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. INTERGI collects non-Personal Information through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed. Intergi thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to network served ads.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </p>
<p>Access to Non-Personal Information&nbsp; is shared, in aggregated format, with INTERGI's advertiser clients and web publishers who use the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, and success of their advertising campaigns. At no time is this non-PII merged with PII. It is useless to any and all parties except as quantifiable data to our advertisers and clients who wish to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.</p>
<p>Shared information</p>
<p>Intergi does not sell or transfer the ownership of its PII or Non-PII, and provides its partners only with access to such information on a limited basis. Before any access is shared with a partner, INTERGI ensures that such partner publishes and adheres to strict privacy principles regarding the use of such information.</p>
<p>Security &amp; Protection of Collected Data </p>
<p>Intergi maintains strict data security systems that ensure specific information will not be made available to any unauthorized person. All collected information is stored on our web server but is not publicly accessible from our website. INTERGI uses a password protected security system to control access to information stored about its users and maintains stringent physical security and only provides access to authorized personal information.</p>
<p>Third Party Ad Servers</p>
<p>Intergi and some of our advertisers use third-party advertising companies like <a href="http://www.maxworldwide.com" title="www.maxworldwide.com">www.maxworldwide.com</a>, <a href="http://www.advertising.com" title="www.advertising.com">www.advertising.com</a> and <a href="http://www.fastclick.com" title="www.fastclick.com">www.fastclick.com</a> to serve their ads on our sites. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie technology to measure ad effectiveness. To do so, these companies may use information about your visits to our sites and other websites. Unless you are otherwise notified, these advertising companies do not use names, addresses, email addresses, or telephone numbers, and they do not link any online actions or cookies to an identifiable person. Use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide ads on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit their respective websites.</p>
