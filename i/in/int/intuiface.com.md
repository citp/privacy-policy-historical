# Privacy Policy | IntuiLab

IntuiLab respects its Users’ privacy and is committed to protecting any personal information shared with IntuiLab. This statement describes how IntuiLab uses personal information shared by Users.

####  **Personal Information**

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, such as a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information. IntuiLab does not automatically collect personal information, including Users’ email address. IntuiLab does log Users’ IP addresses, but does not link such IP addresses to any personal information unless such was voluntarily provided by Users. The Site may use standard technologies, such as “cookies” and other HTML tools, to collect information about the use of the Site. IntuiLab may collect personal information when such is voluntarily provided by Users (for example: if Users request further information, register to a mailing list, etc.) Also, IntuiLab may receive personal information from business partners and vendors. IntuiLab only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Privacy Statement and applicable laws. Access to certain IntuiLab web pages requires a login and a password. Unless the User requests deactivation of his or her personal information as specified below, his or her personal information may be retained by IntuiLab to verify compliance with any applicable agreements and understandings, log software licenses granted, track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.

####  **Notice**

When personal information is collected, IntuiLab will so inform Users and shall also inform the Users of the purpose of the collection. IntuiLab will not transfer Users’ personal information to third parties without their specific consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled “Information Sharing and Disclosure” below. IntuiLab provides its Users with the opportunity to “opt in” prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. In other words, IntuiLab will require its Users’ affirmative action before it may use their information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. At all times, IntuiLab will always give its Users the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving such materials.

####  **Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

IntuiLab uses common Internet technologies, such as cookies and IP addresses, to keep track of interactions with the Company's website and software.

 **Cookies** A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to Users’ computer’s hard drive when such Users visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the Site uses to track the pages visited by Users, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information provided by Users. Some parts of the Site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. A User who prefers not to receive cookies while browsing the Site or via HTML-formatted emails can customize his or her browser to warn him or her before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when his or her browser alerts him or her to its presence. A User can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in his or her browser, which refusal may adversely affect the User’s experience.

 **IP Addresses** When you visit IntuiLab Web sites, or launch Composer and Player, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. Doing so enables IntuiLab 1) for the Web: to track and aggregate non-personal information, 2) for Composer/Player: to check license status and product stability. For example, IntuiLab uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s websites.

 **Remarketing Codes** We use Google remarketing codes and cookies to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on our website. This enables us to provide targeted advertising in the future via ads that will appear on 3rd party websites. If you would like to opt out of our targeted ad activities, visit the Google [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) page.

####  **IntuiFace**

With the Free Edition of Composer, the .ifx file - i.e. the XML-based text file used by IntuiFace to store the structure of an experience - is uploaded onto IntuiLab servers from time to time for internal use only, enabling investigation of usage statistics and product enhancement. IntuiFace never uploads media (such as videos, images, docs, etc.) referenced by the uploaded .ifx file.

With the Pro and Enterprise Editions of Composer, neither the .ifx file nor related media are uploaded onto IntuiLab servers with one exception: the .ifx file will be uploaded when the user grants Composer permission to send a crash report to IntuiLab as an aid in troubleshooting.

With IntuiFace Data Tracking an IntuiFace Composer user may choose to activate the Data Tracking feature to capture and send designated data collected from one Experience on one or more devices to an IntuiLab database server in the cloud. It is the full and unique responsibility of the IntuiFace Composer user to capture and use data resulting in accordance with the laws of the countrieswhere this IntuiFace Experience is played. IntuiLab never uses this data.

####  **IntuiPad**

The IntuiFace Presentation remote control - the IntuiPad - is network-capable:

The internetClient capability establishes outbound access to the Internet and public networks through a firewall.The privateNetworkClientServer capability establishes inbound and outbound access to home and work networks through a firewall.Through use of the above two capabilities, the IntuiPad can auto-detect running IntuiFace Presentation presentations on network-accessible PCs, identifying and locally saving their associated Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses.

####  **How IntuiLab May Use Information Collected**

IntuiLab uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill Users’ requests for certain products and services, to personalize Users’ experience on the Site, to maintain ongoing contacts with its Users, to improve its products using crash report information, and to better understand its Users’ needs and provide them with better services. IntuiLab may also use Users’ information to send them, or to have its business partners send them, direct marketing information or contact them for market research.
