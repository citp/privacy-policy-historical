We hereby inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information received from users of [www.intelligencesquared.com](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/) (this "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the meanings provided in the Terms of Use. 

**By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.**

**Personal Information**

IQ² collects information in order to provide and improve services, features and content (the " **Service** "), to allow users to personalise their use of the Service, and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Site. 

(i) When you register with us through the Site or when you choose to create your own profile webpage we will ask you for personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, postal address, credit card information and an account password. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service, administer your inquiries and to improve the quality and value of the Service.

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. 

**Cookies**

IQ² uses cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to recognise you, so we can simplify your logging-on process and to enable traffic monitoring. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service. 

**Links**

Our Site contains links to other websites. These links and/or other forms of advertisement do not constitute an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through this Site. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. 

**Sharing and Disclosure**

When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, IQ² Users will see your "Screen Name" and any other information you choose to provide. 

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf or to perform Site-related services. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. 

IQ² cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect the property and rights of IQ² or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. 

IQ² may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including information provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganisation, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. If the new entity wishes to make additional uses of your information, different from those described in this Privacy Policy, you will have the opportunity to decline such use in that event.
