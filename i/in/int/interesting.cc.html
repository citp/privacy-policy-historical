				<p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
				
				<p>Last Updated: November 5, 2010</p>
				
				<p>International Web Services, LLC
				("Licensor", "we" or "us") is the licensor of this plugin (the "Plugin"). 
				Licensor knows that you care how information
				about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so
				carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy is a binding part of Licensor's License
				and Terms of Use, which is available <a href="/terms">http://interesting.cc/terms</a>
				(together with this Privacy Policy, the "Agreement") and explains the type of information Licensor
				collects through its website and browser companion software ("Plugin
				Service") and what Licensor does with it. If you download and use Licensor's Plugin
				Service software or use Licensor's website (the "Site"), you will be bound by
				the terms of the Agreement, including this Privacy Policy. This policy may
				change from time to time so you should check it frequently.</p>
				
				<p>Licensor may collect certain information
				about your web usage and sites you have visited, which may be shared with third
				parties and used for advertising. NOTE: THE PLUGIN COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION FOR LICENSOR
				ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VISIT AND YOUR ACTIVITY ON THOSE PAGES, SUCH AS
				IMPRESSIONS AND CLICKS. IN SOME CASES,
				INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE PLUGIN SERVICE MAY BE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE, AND
				IN SOME CASES INFORMATION (INCLUDING INFORMATION FROM OR ABOUT PAGES OF SOCIAL
				MEDIA WEBSITES YOU VISIT) MAY BE USED OR SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR PURPOSES
				OF DISPLAYING TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS TO YOU. 
				BUT PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US, AND WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE WEB
				USAGE DATA TO DETERMINE THE INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY OF ANY PLUGIN USER.</p>
				
				<p><b>What
				Information About Users Does Licensor Gather?</b></p>
				
				<p>Here are the types of information we
				gather.</p>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Information You Give Us:</b>
     				We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or give us in
     				any other way. You provide most
     				such information when you use the Site or the Plugin Service. For instance, if you register for an
     				account with us, we may collect your name, email address, country of
     				origin, and, if you choose, your nickname, telephone number, website,
     				company, and title. If you download
     				and install the Plugin Service software, which provides our Plugin, we
     				collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the
     				installation and registration process, which can include demographic
     				information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code
     				and country. Demographic information may be correlated to web usage
     				information collected during your use of the Plugin Service. In addition, you might provide us with personal
     				identifying information, such as mobile telephone number, when you communicate
     				with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, or complete a questionnaire,
     				subscription form or a contest entry form. You can choose not to provide
     				certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of
     				many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such
     				purposes as responding to your requests, customizing and improving our
     				services, delivering targeted content and advertisements that may be of
     				interest to you, and communicating with you.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Automatic Information We Collect From the Plugin Service: </b>
    				When you use the Plugin Service, we
     				may collect information about the websites you visit and the
     				advertisements that you see on those websites, the searches you perform
     				using search engines, the ways in which you use various Plugin Service
     				features (including whether the Plugin Service is still installed on your
     				computer), and the pages you view (especially social media pages). For example, the Plugin Service may
     				collect information about page views, impressions and clicks, as well as
     				similar web usage information. For every webpage you view while using the Plugin
     				Service, the Plugin Service software transmits and stores information
     				associated with your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which may include a
     				domain name, the full URL of the webpage you are visiting, general
     				information about your browser; general information about your computer's
     				operating system; your Licensor cookie number or other identifying
     				alphanumerical information enabling Licensor to identify your computer;
     				and the date and time the above information is logged. All of this above
     				information may be logged together in a single data string for each webpage
     				you visit. Each string is logged in
     				our database in the chronological order received from our users. In addition, the Plugin Services may
     				collect information about what cookies are stored on your computer, which
     				enables Licensor to determine which websites you have visited in the
     				past.Although this information may
     				contain some personal identifying information, Licensor does not use it to
     				determine the identity of individual users or correlate it to your email
     				address or other personal identifying information that you give us or our
     				affiliates, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, investigations or
     				other legal requirements. When you download the Plugin Service software,
     				and at times during your use of the Site and/or Plugin Service, we may transmit
     				Licensor cookies to the hard drive of your computer. The Plugin Service also automatically
     				collects information about the online advertisements that are displayed on
     				the websites you visit - specifically, the text, source, and URL of the
     				online ad - and the terms you choose when you use search engines to search
     				the Web. Licensor also may periodically collect usage statistics from Plugin
     				Service users that describe the frequency of use of each Plugin Service
     				feature.Finally, to ensure
     				accurate information about the number of Plugin Service users and to check
     				for updates to the Plugin Service, the Plugin Service periodically sends a
     				signal to Licensor containing basic information such as the IP address of
     				your computer.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Automatic Information We Collect from the Site:</b>
     				We receive and store certain types
     				of information whenever you interact with the Site. For example, like many websites, we use
     				"cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your
     				Web browser accesses the Site, when you use the Plugin Service, or when
     				you view advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Licensor
     				on other Web sites.Examples of the
     				information we may collect and analyze when you use our website include
     				the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login;
     				e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as
     				browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and
     				versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator
     				(URL) clickstream to, through, and from the Site, including date and time;
     				cookie; web pages you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you
     				used to call us. During some visits
     				to the Site we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and
     				collect session information, including page response times, download
     				errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information
     				(such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse
     				away from the page.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>What About Cookies?</b></p>
				
				<ul>
 				<li>Cookies
     				are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard
     				drive through your Web browser, and through our Plugin Service, to enable
     				our systems to recognize your browser.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li>The
     				Help portion of the Plugin on most browsers will tell you how to prevent
     				your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify
     				you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>How Do
				We Share the Information and Use the Information We Receive?</b></p>
				
				<p><u>Automatic Information and Aggregated
				Information</u>: We may share (1) automatic information we
				collect from the Plugin Service or the Site, including IP address and your web
				usage data as described above, and (2) aggregated information (i.e.,
				information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically
				identifiable to you) with third parties and affiliated companies to develop and
				deliver targeted advertising through the Plugin Service, on our websites and on
				websites of third parties. Some of these
				advertisements may be displayed to you within existing webpages you are
				viewing.In addition, information from
				social media sites you visit may be used by us and our advertising partners to
				display targeted advertisements to you. You
				hereby consent to these practices, as well as to the other disclosures and uses
				of your information described in this Privacy Policy. We may combine non-personal information we
				collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources.
				We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including
				advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general
				business analysis. For example, we may
				tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our websites or users of the Plugin
				Service and the most popular features or services accessed. This information
				may be used to develop content and services that we hope you and other users
				will find of interest and to target content and advertising. Automatic and aggregated information may also
				be shared with the same types of third parties and for the same purposes as
				personal identifying information, as described below.</p>
				
				<p><u>Personal Identifying Information</u>: We may share user data with our parent,
				affiliate and subsidiary companies to provide you with information about a variety
				of products and services that might interest you. These companies will comply with this Privacy
				Policy and applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any
				commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not
				to receive such e-mail messages from that company in the future.
				Except for personal identifying information
				which may be automatically collected with non-personal web usage information as
				an incidental effect of the operation of the Plugin Service and not to identify
				you as an individual (see above), personal identifying information may be
				shared with unaffiliated third parties only as described below.</p>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Providers of Bundled Software or Services:</b>
     				We may offer search or other services that are
     				powered or provided by another company. You can tell when a third party is
     				involved in a given service offering, and, if you choose to use the
     				service, we will share information related to your use of the service with
     				that company. For example, the Plugin may be bundled with, or require the
     				installation of, third-party software, such as search engine Plugins, and
     				in such event, we may transmit your search term and IP address
     				to the third-party provider so that it can provide you with the requested
     				search results. Such bundling
     				enables the Plugin to perform the functions requested by you and to
     				collect information as described in our Privacy Policy. 
     				Also, if you download our Plugin
     				Service from a third party website, the Plugin Service may display the
     				third party's brand, and consequently that third party may receive
     				information about your use of the Plugin Service. 
     				You should be
     				aware that information may be collected and stored directly by the
     				providers of such third-party software and services and that your use of
     				such software or services (including use in connection with our Plugin) is
     				governed by the terms of use and privacy and security policies and
     				practices of the applicable third-party providers and not by this Privacy
     				Policy. We
     				recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy and security
     				policies of all third-party Plugins and other software or services that
     				may be bundled with the Plugin or installed in connection with the Plugin.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b>
     				We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
     				Examples include storing and
     				analyzing data, providing search results and links (including paid
     				listings and links), hosting, and providing customer service. 
     				These third-party service providers have
     				access to user information needed to perform their functions, but may not
     				use it for other purposes.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Business Transfers:</b>
     				As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries
     				or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one
     				of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises
     				made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the user
     				consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Licensor or substantially all
     				of our assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, user
     				information will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>Protection of Licensor and Others:</b>
     				We release account and other user information when we believe release is
     				appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our License and Terms
     				of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
     				Licensor, our users, or others.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li><b>With Your Consent:</b>
     				Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personally
     				identifiable information about you might go to third parties, and you will
     				have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>In general,
				we may use information (whether personal identifying information or not) that
				we collect about you to:</p>
				
				<ul>
 				<li>deliver the products and services that you have requested;</li>
 				<li>send you offers that you have opted in to receive;</li>
 				<li>manage your relationship with us and provide you with customer support;</li>
 				<li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products,
     				services or content, or products, services or content offered by others;</li>
 				<li>communicate
     				with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about
     				products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or

 				<li>develop and display content and advertising (such as targeted ads) tailored to
     				your interests on&nbsp;our websites and other websites;</li>
 				<li>verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with promotions,
     				contests and sweepstakes;</li>

     				users from fraud, hacking or other harm;</li>
 				<li>cooperate with legal, criminal or regulatory investigations or proceedings;</li>
 				<li>manage our business; and</li>
 				<li>perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of information collection.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>How secure Is Information About Me?</b></p>
				
				<ul>
 				<li>Licensor
     				uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect its
     				databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access,
     				destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure
     				of data.</li>
 				<li>Only authorized employees and authorized
     				third-party service providers are permitted to access personal
     				information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul>
 				<li>If you have an account with us, it is important for you to protect against
     				unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign
     				off when finished using a shared computer.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>What About Third-Party Advertising and Links to Other Websites?</b></p>
				
				<p>We work with third-party websites,
				advertisers, and Internet advertising companies working on their behalf
				(collectively, "Ad Companies"). These Ad Companies may send (or
				"serve") advertisements directly to your browser, from our Site, our Plugin
				Service, and from other websites. They automatically receive your IP address
				when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also
				known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure
				the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. The
				information practices of these Ad Companies are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
				Please contact them directly for more
				information about their privacy practices.</p>
				
				<p><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b></p>
				
				<ul>
 				<li>Licensor
     				does not require that you provide us with personal identifying information
     				in order to use most of our services. Therefore, you can always choose not
     				to provide such information.</li>
