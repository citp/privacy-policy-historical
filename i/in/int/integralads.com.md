# Privacy Policy | Integral Ad Science

Integral Ad Science, Inc. (“Integral Ad Science,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides this Privacy Policy because we know that you care about how your information is collected, used, shared and retained. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected when you visit our websites (such as www.integralads.com and any other website where this policy is displayed) (collectively, the “Website”), or access our client portal at [www.integralplatform.com](http://www.integralplatform.com/) (“Client Portal”). By visiting our Website or accessing our Client Portal, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy also applies to information collected through the verification, optimization and analytics technology solutions (“Technology Solutions”) that we provide to our clients through various channels, including the Client Portal. Our Technology Solutions allow our clients to track marketing performance, match users to their campaigns and understand how users engage with their advertisements, websites and mobile applications, as the case may be.

 **I.OUR WEBSITE AND THE CLIENT PORTAL**  
 **What Information We Collect; the Purpose of Collection and Use**

We collect the following categories of information through our Website and the Client Portal.

 **Contact Information.** We collect contact information from visitors and clients who wish to obtain information or support, or to purchase our Technology Solutions. Contact information is provided via browser forms or online order forms, and may include first name, last name, e-mail address, job title, name of the organization, country, state/region and phone numbers (fax, cell and/or landline), and other information necessary for us to properly respond. This contact information is used by our sales, support and solutions teams to contact our Website visitors and clients, as appropriate, so that we can provide the requested information, support, or Technology Solutions.

 **Billing Information.** We collect billing and payment information from our clients, which may include a purchase order number, an account number, or instructions for wire transfers and/or ACH transfers. When payment is made by credit card, we use third party credit card processors. The billing and payment information is used to prepare and send invoices, make and receive payments, and manage client accounts.

 **Automatic Data Collection.** Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection technology (e.g., Google Analytics) when you visit our Website or the Client Portal. These services may use tracking technologies such as, but not limited to, cookies to collect information on our behalf such as your IP address, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website or the Client Portal you visit, number of links you click while on the Website or the Client Portal, search terms, and other data. By accessing and using the Website or the Client Portal, you consent to the processing of data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Please be advised that if you opt out of any service, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Website or the Client Portal.

For more information on Google Analytics, including how to opt out from certain data collection, please visit [https://www.google.com/analytics.](https://www.google.com/analytics)

 **Google AdWords.** We also use Google Conversion Tracking (another web analytics service provided by Google), on our Website. If you access our Website via a Google ad, then Google AdWords places a cookie in your browser (“Conversion Cookie”) which is valid for 30 days. If you access our Website while the Conversion Cookie is still valid, we and Google can recognize that a user has clicked on the ad and was transferred to our Website. Every AdWords client uses a different cookie, and therefore it is not possible to track cookies via the websites of AdWords clients. The information obtained via the Conversion Cookie is used by Google to assemble conversion reports for AdWords clients. The AdWords clients receive reports stating the number of users that clicked on their ad and were transferred to a site that includes the Conversion Tracking Tag, but the reports do not include any information that would allow them to identify the user(s).

 **Marketo.** As a Marketo subscriber, we use their cookies help us track your visits to our Website and enable us to create an engaging marketing experience for you. We also use Marketo cookies to understand your interaction with the emails we send you, and to ensure we’re sending you relevant information. For example, it lets us know whether our emails have been opened, and which links are clicked. You can learn more about Marketo’s services here: [https://www.marketo.com/.](https://www.marketo.com/)

 **Other Third Party Services.** Third party services incorporated into the Website, such as social media widgets (e.g., Facebook Like button or the Twitter Share button), online advertising networks or job applicant tracking services, may collect information about your visits to our Website for other purposes, including interest-based advertising. You may also voluntarily provide information to third party service providers incorporated into the Website, such as job applicant tracking services. The information collected by third party services incorporated into the Website may include personal information such as IP addresses, pages visited, times and dates of visits, browser or operating system configuration and other usage data, which may also be combined with information collected from other sites. Third party services are hosted by a third party. Your interactions with these applications are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing the application and/or service, and not by this Privacy Policy. 

Industry trade associations maintain web pages where you can opt out of interest-based advertising by all participating companies:

  * Network Advertising Initiative: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices>
  * Digital Advertising Alliance: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>
  * And, in Europe, [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)



 **Cookies.** Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visits to our Website and other sites as described this Privacy Policy. We also use cookies on the Client Portal to ensure authorized access to client-specific secure content and reports. When accessing client-specific secure content, you are acting as a representative of your company and your interactions with our Client Portal in this capacity are governed by our relationship agreement with your company. Our cookie policy is available at <http://integralads.com/cookie-policy>.

 **II.TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS**  
 **A.What Information We Collect; the Purpose of Collection and Use**

When purchasing Technology Solutions, our clients authorize the collection, processing and transfer of the categories of information set forth below. Our clients assume contractual responsibility for providing appropriate notification of these data processing and transfer activities to customers, end users, visitors and other affected individuals, obtaining all necessary consents (including with respect to use of cookies, pixels and similar technology), and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

We collect the following categories of information when providing Technology Solutions to our clients, which allow our clients to track marketing performance, match users to their campaigns and understand how users engage with client advertisements, websites and mobile applications, as the case may be. We use the collected data to analyze the performance of marketing campaigns and provide fraud detection services and performance reports to our clients. We do not combine the collected data with any other data that would enable us to personally identify the user.

 **Log-level data.** When individuals use a computer or mobile device to visit a website or mobile application where our pixel tags or software development kits (“SDKs”), are deployed, our servers automatically collect and store certain information sent by each browser. These server logs include information about the browser accessing the page, such as IP address, browser type, user agent, referring URL, information about the page where an ad was displayed, the dimensions and location of the ad and generalized user interaction data. We use this data to provide our Technology Solutions, and for fraud detection purposes.

 **Mobile device data.** Through mobile applications on which our pixel tags or SDKs are deployed, we (or our clients and other application providers we work with) may also collect log-level data, information about users’ interactions with those applications (including IP address and time-stamp information), and information about users’ mobile devices (including device type, device make and model, operating system type and version, mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID and bundleID (an app identifier)). We use this data to provide our Technology Solutions, and for fraud detection purposes.

 **Mobile device tracking opt-out.** Individual users that opt-out of mobile device tracking limit the information that is collected about them and/or how it is used. You may opt-out of interest-based and demographic-based advertising using your mobile device settings. Please follow the below instructions for Android and iOS applications.

Opt-out process for Android-based mobile devices:

  * Open the Google Settings app on your device
  * Select Ads
  * Set the “Opt-out of interest-based ads” slider to your desired position
  * Optionally, you may reset the advertising identifier associated with your device



Opt-out process for iOS-based mobile devices:

  * Open Settings
  * Select Privacy
  * Select Advertising
  * Set the “Limit Ad Tracking” slider to your desired position
  * Optionally, you may reset the advertising identifier associated with your device



Please note that opting out through a website (see, “Automatic Data Collection,” and “Other Third Party Services,” above) will not limit the collection of information on mobile devices, and opting out on your mobile device will not limit the collection of information through your computer’s browser. Opting out limits the collection of data but does not eliminate it completely. Some information will still be collected about your use of websites or mobile applications after you limit tracking on that platform.

 **Cookies.** Our Technology Solutions use pixel tags, SDKs and cookies to enable campaign performance analytics and optimization services on behalf of our clients. We collect information about browsers, devices, and how users interact with web and mobile content, through the use of pixel tags and SDKs that enable us to associate unique cookie IDs with a browser. Such collected information may include measurements pertaining to ad viewability and user interactions with the ad as well as other elements of the web page on which the ad is displayed, and viewability data and generalized user interaction data collected, in many cases, across unaffiliated websites visited by the same user. We or they may deploy and read these unique IDs, and thus passively “collect” them, when users go to a website or application where our pixel tags, SDKs and/or cookies are deployed.

 **IP Addresses.** Our Technology Solutions collect and provide IP addresses to advertiser and advertising agency clients for the purpose of assisting in the detection and prevention of fraudulent activity (including location spoofing). We also pair IP addresses with the locations where they are likely being used (at the postal code level), and use that information to provide our Technology Solutions.

 **B.Our Technology Solutions**

 **Use of Pixel Tags.** Pixels (also sometimes referred to as beacons or web beacons) and tags are elements included in web pages to enable companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measuring ad effectiveness or preventing fake ad traffic. They do this by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of website code that is run by the web browser.

Pixel tags are small, invisible images on a web page or other document. Pixel tags allow the operator of the web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies and to directly collect information from browsers and devices. Our pixel tags allow cookies to be set, read, and modified when you visit a website, and directly collect the information described under “Log-level data,” “Mobile device data,” and “Cookies.”

 **Use of Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.** We also use, or partner with publishers or publisher-facing and application developer platforms that use mobile SDKs, to collect the types of information described under “Log-level data,” “Mobile device data,” and “Cookies.” An SDK is a piece of computer code that developers include in their mobile applications. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with a mobile device.

 **Use of Cross-Device and Cross-App Technology.** We may work with third parties that provide cross-device and cross-app technology to establish connections among devices (such as mobile devices, tablets, and computers) used by an individual. We may share anonymous identifiers (such as cookies, mobile device IDFAs, or Google Advertising IDs) with those third parties to assist in connecting devices. Using these connections, we may combine information about an individual’s use of websites or applications on his/her current device, with usage information from his/her other devices. We use this information to provide Technology Solutions to enable campaign performance analytics and optimization services on behalf of our clients.

 **III.ADDITIONAL USES OF INFORMATION**

 **Aggregate Data.** In an ongoing effort to better understand our clients and visitors, and how they interoperate with our Website and the Client Portal, we may analyze your information in aggregate form to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website, the Client Portal and the Technology Solutions. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Technology Solutions, the Website and the Client Portal to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

 **Additional Uses.** We also use Contact Information, Billing Information and other information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to respond to general inquiries, solicit feedback regarding our Technology Solutions, the Client Portal and support, provide relevant content on our Website, and to communicate with you via email regarding our current and future Technology Solutions.
