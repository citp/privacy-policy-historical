					InterCall, Inc. ("InterCall") is a leading provider of audio

					site (the "InterCall Site") to provide you with access to 
					these services. We understand your need for privacy when 
					using the Web for your communication. This policy discloses 
					InterCall's practices with respect to the collection, use 
					and disclosure of user information collected through the 
					InterCall Site and through your use of InterCall services.<br>
					<br>
					<b>1. NOTICE.</b> In connection 
					with the operation of the InterCall site we will ask you to

					information regarding InterCall ("InterCall Secondary Use"). 
					In addition, with your permission, we may provide your 
					Personal Information to other companies who may contact you 
					regarding products, services, and offers that may be of 
					interest to you, but that are not directly related to 
					InterCall or the InterCall Site ("Third Party Secondary 
					Use").</span></p>
					<p><span class="content-black">
					InterCall may provide Personal Information to vendors that 
					assist InterCall in processing the information. InterCall 
					requires such vendors to enter into agreements with 
					InterCall prohibiting disclosure of the information to 
					others and restricting its use to providing the contracted 
					services of InterCall.</span></p>
					<p>
					<span class="content-black">
					<b>2. CHOICE.</b> 
					As we noted above in Section 1, we will not use your 
					Personal Information for any Third Party Secondary Uses 
					unless you affirmatively choose to participate in such 
					Secondary Uses. You may also stop the delivery of 
					informational or promotional mail from us by following the 
					instructions included in the informational or promotional 
					mail itself.</span></p>
					<p>
					<span class="content-black">
					<b>3. ACCESS.</b> 
					When you register to use any of the services offered by 
					InterCall, InterCall will send you a confirmation of your 
					registration showing the Personal Information that we 
					obtained from your registration. Also, we will take 
					reasonable steps to give you the opportunity to correct 
					inaccuracies in the Personal Information we retain 
					concerning you and delete Personal Information concerning 
					you upon your request.</span></p>
					<p>
					<span class="content-black">
					<b>4. SECURITY.</b>

					others that obtain access through illegal measures, in the 
					absence of negligence on the part of InterCall. Further, the 
					other sites that you may access through the InterCall Site 
					may have different security practices and you should 
					familiarize yourself with those practices.</span></p>
					<p><span class="content-black">You 
					are responsible for the confidentiality and security of 
					passwords that InterCall issues to you. If you believe that

					manner, please notify us promptly.</span></p>
					<p>
					<span class="content-black">
					<b>5. COMPLAINTS.</b>

					<p>
					<span class="content-black">
					<b>6. DISCLOSURE FOR LEGAL PURPOSES.</b> 
					We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by 
					law or in the good-faith belief that such action is 
					necessary: (a) to conform to the edicts of the law or comply 
					with legal process served on us or our affiliates, (b) to 
					protect and defend our rights or property or those of our 
					users, (c) to protect the personal safety of our users or

					we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell 
					assets related to our business. In such transactions 
					Personal Information generally is one of the transferred

					<span class="content-black">
					<b>7. ANONYMOUS INFORMATION.</b> 
					Please understand that, in addition to collecting Personal 
					Information, InterCall will also gather information that

					effectiveness of marketing efforts on the InterCall Site,

					purposes. For example, we might use this Anonymous 
					Information to inform our advertisers how many users visited 
					a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can 
					measure whether the advertisement was effective. Generally, 
					you will not be aware when such Anonymous Information is 
					being collected about you - it may be collected in various 
					ways, such as through traffic data or direct surveys of our 
					customers and may entail the use of, among other things, 
					cookies, IP addresses, or other numeric codes used to 
					identify the computer or other device used to access our 
					site.</span></p>
