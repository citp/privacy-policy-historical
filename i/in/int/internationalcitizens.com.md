Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, which you enter into on the Websites, and information about you that is available on the internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google, or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers.

Personal Information also includes Navigational Information where such information can directly or indirectly identify an individual. Navigational information refers to information about your computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and pages viewed. Please see the “Navigation Information” section below. Except for this, we do not collect Sensitive Information from you.

In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Information to:

### The Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA visitors only)

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will typically collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a service for you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a service for you, we will make this clear at the time of the request and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not. We will also alert you to the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information. Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you can contact our Data Protection Officer at [privacy@internationalcitizens.com](mailto:privacy@internationalcitizens.com).

For example, as long as is required to contact you about the quotes you requested, or to manage your policy as the Broker of Record, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we securely delete the information or anonymize it or, if this is not possible, then we will safely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “To Unsubscribe from Our Communications” below.
