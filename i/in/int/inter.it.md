Open User Access

## This website, inter.it (the "Site"), and all personal information collected from users of this Site are owned solely by F. C. Internazionale Milano S.p.A. In this Privacy Policy references to "we", "us" and "our" are references to F. C. Internazionale Milano S.p.A. .

## We take the privacy of our users seriously

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) outlines how we treat your personal information and forms part of the “Terms and Conditions” of this Site. This Policy applies only to this Site, and not to the collection and use of personal information by any third party via any website to which there are links on this Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites, and encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site.

## Consent

Your use of this Site signifies your consent to our collecting and using information (sometimes personal information) about you in accordance with this Policy. 

## What information do we collect?

You may access this Site's home page and browse the Site without disclosing any personal data. In order to provide you with a range of services, however, we may collect personal information from this Site, which we will ask you for when and if needed. In such cases we will explicitly ask for your permission to process the collected data (for example on the registration page). 

## How do we use your information?

Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. 

We may use your personal information to communicate with you, such as to let you know about new features or offers on inter.it, for record-keeping purposes, and in aggregate form (and therefore anonymously) for market-research purposes, to track activity on our Site, to publish trends and/or to improve usefulness and content and for any other purpose that we may notify you and the relevant data protection authority about.  
We may operate one or more mailing lists to send you INTER-related news. These mailing lists currently operate as 'opt-in' mailing lists whereby subscribers add themselves to the list. 

We only send emails to addresses which have been subscribed to each list. We do not 'spam'.  
If you wish to unsubscribe from a list (see Unsubscribe below), you can do it from your profile page (as a registered user) or by emailing us at registrazione_sito@inter.it. We currently do not share, license or sell these email addresses.  
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to anyone who may take over the running of the Site or who may purchase any or all of our assets including your personal information. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to any law enforcement agency requesting it in connection with the commission of any offence, once we are reasonably satisfied as to the circumstances surrounding the request.  
We also reserve the right to access and disclose your personal information in order to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly or to protect our users and ourselves. Except as expressly stated in this Policy, we will not sell, share, trade or license your personal information to others without your express consent.

## Security

We take every precaution to protect your personal information. In addition, we have strict security protocols in place to protect our customer database from unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss. We only allow access to the customer database when absolutely necessary, and then under strict guidelines as to how such details may be used. We may ask you for proof of identity before disclosing any personal information to you. 

## Surveys

We always aim to improve the services we offer. As a result, we may occasionally canvass our customers using surveys. Participation in surveys is voluntary, and you are under no obligation to reply to any survey you might receive from us. Should you choose to do so, we will treat the information you provide with the same high standard of care as all other customer information. 

## Activities

Your participation on our Site may mean that we occasionally contact you with the opportunity to join activities (such as play online games or enter competitions). Participation in any of these activities is voluntary, and you are under no obligation to take up an invitation from us to participate. Should you choose to join an activity, we will treat the information you provide with the same high standard of care as all other customer information.
