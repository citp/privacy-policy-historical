We will disclose your personal information when we are required by law to do so or when we suspect fraudulent or criminal activities.  We also may disclose your personal information when otherwise permitted by applicable privacy laws such as, for example, when disclosure is needed to enforce our rights arising out of any agreement, transaction or relationship with you.
