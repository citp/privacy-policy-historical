# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for [www.integrationmarketing.com](http://www.integrationmarketing.com/) and [www.integration-marketing.com](http://www.integration-marketing.com/). 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has provided users a mechanism to control their privacy -- far exceeding the privacy controls of most web sites.  When a web site visitor presses the button at the bottom of this page, this web site will not track the user's  web site navigational behavior during the session.   

 **Full Disclosure**

Additionally, this privacy policy will disclose:  

1\. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site  
2. The organization collecting the information   
3. How the information is used   
4. With whom the information may be shared   
5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information   
6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under IMark control   
7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.   
If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should contact Mark Melin via e-mail, at [mark.melin@ommgroup.com](mailto:mark.melin@ommgroup.com). 

 **Collection and Use**

IMark is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  IMark collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

 **Registration**

In order to use certain aspects of this Web site, such as obtain a white paper or submit an e-mail quotation, a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as job function or product interest), and unique identifiers (such as company name), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  Additionally, when IMark invites a Web site visitor to enter this Web site through a personalized entry page, the Web site identifies the user by name and company name and then tracks subsequent Web site behavior. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our return visitor information. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

 **Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  This information is fed into a profile engine to assign a specific user profile.

 **Profile Development**

When a user visits the IMark Web site, we track all Web site behavior.  This Web behavior is sent through our profile engine for interpretation.  Based on Web site behavior, the profile engine assigns specific profiles based on Web site behavior and navigational choices.  This profile determines product interest, likely job function, thought process, Web site loyalty, and purchasing potential, all based on how the Web site is navigated by a user.  If you want to see your profile data, send an e-mail to [mark.melin@ommgroup.com](mailto:mark.melin@ommgroup.com) and specify the exact time you visited the site, and your profile data will be returned to you.  **  **

**Sharing**

We will not share aggregated demographic information on/with any third party.

 **Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that IMark is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

 **Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  IMark will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  IMark stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

 **Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [mark.melin@ommgroup.com](mailto:mark.melin@ommgroup.com).

 **Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and regarding issues that relate to their account via email or phone.

 **Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**We Protect Your Privacy**

The information gathered from this site is intended strictly for the internal use of the company. Data regarding those visiting the IMark Web site, such as e-mail address, industry affiliation and job function, will not be sold or otherwise distributed by the company to any outside entity. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy or this site, please e-mail your comments to [webmaster@ommgroup.com](mailto:webmaster@ommgroup.com) or call Mark Melin at 630-571-6664.
