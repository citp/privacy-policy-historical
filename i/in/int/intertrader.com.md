Data Protection and Privacy Policy
Data Protection Act
London Capital Group Limited (LCG) may process information relating to you (including
personal data as defined under the Data Protection Act 1998), including holding such
information in a manual format or electronic database, in order to satisfy any contractual,
regulatory or statutory requirements we may have. Unless we receive specific written
instructions to the contrary, by providing this information you agree that we may process
this information in order to fulfill such obligations.
Privacy Policy
Introduction:
Protecting the security and privacy of your personal information is important to LCG and to
the way it conducts its business in compliance with laws on privacy, data protection and data
security. LCG hopes the policy outlined below will help you understand what information
LCG may collect, how it uses and safeguards that information and with whom it may share it.
At LCG, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in our business.
In the course of our business, it is necessary to collect Personal Information about our
potential clients. We take this activity seriously and seek to provide fair, secure and
appropriate methods for the handling of Personal Information. All such activities are
intended to be consistent with both generally accepted privacy ethics and standard business
practices. Your Personal Information may be shared with a limited number of trusted
partners and/or affiliates of LCG where such use is restricted to the management of your
account and will not breach any elements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.
If you have any questions or comments about LCG’s Privacy Policy, please contact our
Customer Support team via the details on the Contacts page.
Personally Identifiable Information
Through its websites, LCG will not collect any personally identifiable information about you
(e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("personal information")),
unless you voluntarily choose to provide it (e.g. by registration, email enquiry, survey). If you
do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it. When you do
provide personal information, LCG usually uses it to respond to your enquiry, or provide you
access to specific account information, and to support its customer relationship with you.
LCG may store and process personal information and share it within the LCG group of
companies to better understand your business needs and how LCG can improve its products
and services; or LCG (or a third party on its behalf) may use Personal Information to contact
you about a LCG offer in support of your business needs or to conduct online surveys to
understand better its customers' needs and profiles.
If you choose not to have your personal information used to support its customer
relationship programmes (especially direct-marketing or market-research), LCG will respect
your choice. LCG do not now (and do not intend to in the future) sell, rent or otherwise
market your personal information to third parties.
You may opt out of receiving marketing emails at any time by selecting the 'unsubscribe' link
at the top of the emails or by emailing our Customer Support team (via the details on the
Contacts page) with your request.

consent of their parent or guardian. LCG encourages all parents or guardians to instruct their

children for any purpose whatsoever, including disclosure to third parties.

information that is not personally identifiable (e.g. type of Internet browser and computer
operating system used; domain name of the website from which you came; number of visits,
average time spent, pages viewed). LCG may use this information and share it within the
LCG group to measure the use of its website and improve its content.

to comply with the principles of good practice in the processing of personal data. Details of
Data Protection registration may be found on their website www.dpr.gov.uk
Retention of records
We will keep Personal Information only as long as it is necessary, including for the purposes
of updating the product or services or as required by law. When the Personal Information is
no longer required, it will be destroyed either by shredding or other approved destruction
methods to prevent unauthorised parties from gaining access to the information during and
after the process.
We will safeguard information in our custody.
Security
LCG takes precautions to ensure the security of your personal information and strives to
keep it accurate. LCG carefully protects your personal information from loss, destruction,
falsification, manipulation, and unauthorised access or unauthorised disclosure and has
developed and will maintain security procedures to safeguard Personal Information against
