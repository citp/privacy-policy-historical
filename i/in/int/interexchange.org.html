For certain Services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong></p>
<p>As part of your registration you are agreeing to receive communications from us and other third parties in order to provide Services to you. While you may opt out from receiving certain types of marketing communications such as our marketing emails, you may not opt out of receiving Service related communications. When your account is deactivated or canceled, you will receive an email confirming such action.&nbsp; We reserve the right to contact you at any time regarding subscription renewals, profile deactivation, account cancellation, and other membership-related problems or questions.&nbsp; In addition, without limiting any of the foregoing, we reserve the right to communicate with you after your account is deactivated or canceled, for any compliance related matters, including, but not limited to, legal, visa and program related issues.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>When you access our Web site, we or our service providers may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Services by storing user preferences and tracking user trends.</p>
<p><strong>Log information</strong></p>
<p>When you access our Web site, our or our service provider’s servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>When you access our Web site, we or our service providers may use invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information. IEX may use this information to improve our Services, including, marketing programs and content.</p>
<p><strong>IEX Services on other Websites</strong></p>
<p>We offer some of our Services on or through other websites. PII that you provide to those websites may be sent to us in order to deliver the Service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated websites through which our Services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.&nbsp; We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their websites.</p>
<p><strong>Widgets</strong></p>
<p>Our website includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. allowing you to share a profile with your FaceBook or Twitter account). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>
<p><strong>Information Disclosure to Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We share your PII with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to provide Services, 2) legally required, or, 3) permitted by you.&nbsp; We may disclose your Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion. We also may disclose your Information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also report Information about your account to credit bureaus.</p>
<p><strong>Information Transfer</strong></p>
<p>If IEX becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, you affirmatively consent to our transfer or sale of all PII provided by you.&nbsp; We may provide notice before PII is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information Security</strong></p>
<p>The security of your sensitive PII is important to us. IEX and/or its third party providers use best industry security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of sensitive PII collected by and/or provided to us and under our or such third party provider’s control. No security system is completely secure. Accordingly, we and our third party providers cannot guarantee the complete security of your Information.</p>
<p><strong>Data integrity</strong></p>
<p>IEX processes PII only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the PII needed to provide or improve our Services or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the PII we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users, subscribers, coordinators, customers and clients to update or correct their PII whenever necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></p>
<p>We also provide links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices which are operated and hosted by third parties. These other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their websites.&nbsp; We encourage you to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those websites. Information provided to those websites will be subject to the privacy policy posted at that website.</p>
<p><strong>Send to a Friend/Colleague</strong></p>
<p>When you ask us to invite or send information to a friend or colleague, we will send them a message on your behalf using your name.&nbsp; The invitation or message may also contain information about the person’s business with IEX.&nbsp; In the case of an employer, it might say something like “XX Employer is an employer client of InterExchange’s Work &amp; Travel USA program”.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. If they do not want us to keep their information, we will also remove it at their request.</p>
<p><strong>Location Data</strong></p>
<p>IEX or it service providers may offer location-enabled services. If you use those services, IEX may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID).</p>
<p><strong>Notification</strong></p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your sensitive PII in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as commercially reasonably possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interexchange.org" target="_blank">privacy@interexchange.org</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
<p><strong>Public Forums</strong></p>
<p>When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Services, such as a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, wall, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through our Services, the information that you submit may be made available to the general public. For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other users to locate you (including photos and videos), or financial information on these areas of our Services.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. You grant us full royalty free permission to use any testimonials, reviews, photos or videos or other Postings you may post on or about our Services for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Data Transfers Across International Boarders</strong></p>
<p>If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with the applicable local rules where you are located, you should not submit your or any other persons PII to us. Anyone who accesses, uses or interacts with us, our third party providers or the Services who submits PII does thereby consent to: (i) the international transfer and/or storage of such information to a country which may be deemed to have inadequate data protection and (ii) the collection, using, securing, transfer and sharing of such PII as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless Addresses</strong></p>
<p>If the email address you provide to us is a wireless email address, you agree to receive communications at such address from IEX in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. You understand that your wireless carrier's standard or premium rates apply to these messages. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>
<p>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the website requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing."</p>
<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a website that does not seem to be affiliated with our Web site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interexchange.org" target="_blank">privacy@interexchange.org</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Control of Your Password</strong></p>
<p>You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</p>
<p><strong>Minors</strong></p>
<p>IEX does not seek to obtain nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Services. If a minor (as defined by applicable law) provides us with his/her data without parental or guardian consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice which may include email notification of Privacy Policy changes. Your access, use or interaction with us, our third party providers or the Services following the posting of such changes or the updated Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy frequently to make sure that you understand how we collect, track, compile, use, transfer, secure and share Information.</p>
<p><strong>Questions, Comments or Changes to Your PII</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments, or wish to change the PII we have about you, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@interexchange.org" target="_blank">privacy@interexchange.org</a>.</p>
