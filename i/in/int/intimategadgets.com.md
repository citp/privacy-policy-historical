# Privacy Policy丨IntimateGadgets.com

We are glad that you (referred to herein as "the customer", "you" "your(s)" or "user") have chosen to shop at IntimateGadgets.com. We are committed to protecting your privacy online. This page explains how we collect, use and protect the information that you provide to us. We respect your privacy and intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information.

_What Information IntimateGadgets Collects_

IntimateGadgets may collect three types of information from customers of IntimateGadgets: 

Personally Identifiable Information

Device Information

Aggregate Information

_Personally identifiable information_ is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate you (such as name, email address, postal address, telephone number).

_Device information_ is information about the device and its attributes (such as information about how your browser is configured, whether your device has enabled cookies, its Flash settings, the device's identification number and other characteristics about the device); it also may be personally identifiable information in cases where it is associated with the name or other identifier for you. We use device information for purposes such as enhancing your experience and fraud prevention.

_Aggregate information_ is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about customers of IntimateGadgets (such as frequency of visits to Sites, Site pages most frequently accessed browser type). Aggregate information also may include pages visited along with any navigation and in-page interactions used during each visit. In-page interactions monitored include: clicks and selections, mouse movement, page scrolling, and form fields focused on (specific keystrokes entered into each field are not collected). Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.

If you chose to use third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, to log into one of our sites that offers that login feature, we may collect information, such as your basic profile information, gender, age, interests, and other demographic and geographical information, from the social networking site you use to interact with our site. If you do not want to share information from your social networking account with us you can either decline to use these features or check your social networking site's current privacy setting options to see what options they provide for limiting disclosures when you use login sharing features.

This privacy policy will apply to our use of information collected about you through these offerings. We do not control the privacy practices of your social networking sites.

With whom may IntimateGadgets share information

Unless IntimateGadgets has your permission, as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, or as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, IntimateGadgets will only share the personally identifiable information you provide online with other entities that are part of the IntimateGadgets corporate family and/or outside service providers who may be used to ship products, process credit cards, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on IntimateGadgets's behalf. These service providers, which may include our affiliates, are prohibited from using your information for any other purpose, including their own marketing.

When IntimateGadgets uses third parties to assist in processing your personally identifiable information, IntimateGadgets requires that these third parties establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we provide them. 

IntimateGadgets may share personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing purposes, but will provide you with choices about disclosures of personally identifiable information for marketing purposes.

Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for IntimateGadgets to disclose your personally identifiable information without your permission to government officials or otherwise as required by legal obligations. IntimateGadgets may disclose such personally identifiable information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against claims, including fraud or infringement investigations.

Data collected online may be combined with information you provide through other means of communication, such as postal mail or third parties to further carry out the purposes described above under the heading "NOTICE, How IntimateGadgets uses the information collected regarding customers".

In addition, IntimateGadgets reserves the right to share aggregate information collected from you of IntimateGadgets, without prior notice, with entities that are part of the IntimateGadgets corporate family and unrelated third parties. As stated earlier, aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by such compiled information.

If you choose to make information available to other people through instant messages, status updates, group forum discussions or lists, electronic mail messages, bulletin boards, blog postings, or by joining groups or using other networking functions that we may offer on the Sites (either our own or through third party applications such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTuBe), this information will be visible to these third parties. Please take care in deciding what information you choose to make available through these mechanisms, as we do not control the manner in which recipients or persons who may see the information may use, retain, or re-disclose the information that you choose to provide. In addition, if you use third party social networking sites to interact with IntimateGadgets, we may exchange information with those social networking sites. Whether to use social networking sites to interact with IntimateGadgets, when that capability is offered, is your choice. In addition, you may restrict the sharing of information from your social networking accounts to the extent permitted by your social networking site's privacy settings.

_Service Orders_

To purchase services, you may be asked to be directed to a third party site, like PayPal, to pay for their purchases. If applicable, the third party site may collect payment information directly to facilitate a transaction. None of this information will be captured or stored by IntimateGadgets.

_Links to third party web sites_

Links to third party web sites or widgets to enable sharing of information through social networks on IntimateGadgets.com are provided solely as a convenience to you. When you use these links, you leave the Sites. IntimateGadgets has not reviewed all of these third party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of the third party sites, their content or privacy practices. IntimateGadgets does not endorse or make any representations about the third party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites. If you decide to access any of the linked sites, IntimateGadgets encourages you to read their privacy statements. The customer accesses such sites at his/her own risk.

_Bankruptcy or Sale of business_

IntimateGadgets reserves the right to share or transfer personally identifiable information and aggregate information to a third party should IntimateGadgets ever file for bankruptcy or in the event of a sale, merger or acquisition of IntimateGadgets, provided such third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Statement.

_DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS_

Should you find inaccuracies in such customers’ information, or desire to close an account or view or remove the personally identifiable information IntimateGadgets may have regarding you, you may contact IntimateGadgets through the communication methods described below, or when technically feasible, directly on a Site. IntimateGadgets will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond to requests for access, updating or removal within thirty (30) days of receiving requests. IntimateGadgets may decline to process customers’ access, updating or removal requests concerning their personally identifiable information if the requests require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of other customers, are inconsistent with our legal obligations, or are impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

_SECURITY_

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, IntimateGadgets implements physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information IntimateGadgets collects. IntimateGadgets uses encryption when using the Internet to transfer or receive requested sensitive personally identifiable information. However, IntimateGadgets does not guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of personally identifiable information.

Internal IntimateGadgets access to customers’ nonpublic personally identifiable information is restricted to IntimateGadgets's administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis. These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements.

Your passwords are keys to accounts. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and do not disclose passwords to other people in order to prevent loss of account control. You are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts. Notify IntimateGadgets of any password compromises, and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection.

_Data Retention_

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [cs@IntimateGadgets.com](mailto:cs@allbuy.com) and we will deactivate your account and will retain and use your information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

_ENFORCEMENT_

In the event IntimateGadgets becomes aware that the security of a Site has been compromised or your personally identifiable information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to security attacks or fraud, IntimateGadgets reserves the right to take reasonable appropriate measures, including but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, IntimateGadgets will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if IntimateGadgets believes that there is a reasonable risk of harm to you as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law.
