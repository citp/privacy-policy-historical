Collecting Your Data**

Intuit QuickBooks Online processes adhere to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the [U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Program](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).

  1.  A product purchase
  2.  Registration of a purchased product
  3.  A request for information
  4.  A request for any trial products that Intuit may offer



Intuit complies fully with the Data Protection Act 1998 and all applicable data protection & privacy legislation. Intuit will only process personal data in accordance with the applicable rules and this privacy policy. All personal data you submit will be controlled by Intuit.

Using Your Data**  
It is Intuit's policy that you should know exactly what personal data we collect from you and how we will use it. We collect personal data from you for the purpose of processing your order or enquiry. We may use your personal data to supply products and services to you that you have requested, carry out any agreement with you or take any steps that you have requested. In particular, we may:

  1.  Update you as to the status of your order
  2.  Alert you to important product revisions or updates
  3.  Inform you about upgrades to your purchased Intuit products
  4.  Ensure that you are properly registered to receive technical support



  
In addition to the above uses, where you have given us appropriate permission, we may also use your personal data for the following purposes and direct marketing ('Additional Purposes'):

  1. To tell you about special discounts on additional Intuit products and services
  2. To advise you about new Intuit products and services
  3. To advise you about new products from other carefully-screened companies that Intuit feels may be of interest to you (we carefully screen and then select such companies only when we are satisfied that their products and/or services are likely to be of interest to you)



Aggregate data is general data about groups of customers and does not identify individual customers. Intuit may combine your data with that of other individuals to create aggregate data which we will use to improve our products & services and develop new ones. For example, we may tell a third party how many people purchased a certain product, but not that you personally purchased a specific item.

You should also be aware that we may occasionally provide links from our Web site to other sites that we think will interest you. If you click on a banner advertisement or any other link, the 'click' will take you off the Intuit site. Once you leave any Intuit Web site, any information that you may have provided remains with us and is not forwarded to the next site to which you have linked. Personal data that you may choose to provide to a third party Web site linked to an Intuit Web site will be subject to the privacy policy of the operators of the third party Web site. Intuit is not responsible for the use or protection of personal data you disclose to a third party Web site operator, even if reached from an Intuit Web site.

Cookies allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer. Cookies also allow us to customise your visit to our Web sites by recognising you when you return. Cookies cannot be used to see any other data on your computer, nor can they determine your e-mail address or identity.

Most browsers accept and maintain cookies by default. Check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preference. You can choose to decline cookies while at our Web site, but this may limit your ability to access certain areas of the Web site.

Cookies are required for these services to authenticate registered users and to provide access to certain areas of our Web sites that are available to limited registered users only. Cookies are deleted when you close your browser, as well; this authentication becomes invalid after a certain period of time.

With or without cookies, our Web sites track usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This data is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log data is not linked to personal data gathered elsewhere on the site.

**Disclosing Your Data**  
Intuit may also transfer personal data to Intuit-affiliated companies in other countries. These may be outside the European Economic Area and may not have adequate laws that protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. Where this is done, Intuit shall take necessary steps to adequately protect the information transferred. BY SUPPLYING PERSONAL DATA TO INTUIT, YOU CONSENT TO ANY SUCH TRANSFER.

It is Intuit's policy that you are kept in control of the ways in which we use your personal data for the Additional Purposes. All Intuit communications, in whatever medium, that involve the recording of personal data for these Additional Purposes include a short section that allows you to indicate your preferences with respect to the use of that personal data. You can choose whether or not you wish to receive additional information or promotional offers from Intuit.

  * In the interests of national security to prevent or detect crime or to investigate the unauthorised use of a telecommunications system
  * To secure the effective operation of our telecommunications system



**Additional Information**  
Any information that you choose to provide us with will be used to personalise and improve our customer service operations. All information is collected and stored in a secure manner and is used strictly in relation to this policy and your stated preference. Intuit shall not be responsible or liable for loss of privacy, disclosure of information, harm, damage or loss that may result from your transmission of any information to us. In addition, under the law, we must cooperate fully with any law enforcement agency should a situation arise where our information about customers could be of assistance.

From time to time, Intuit may introduce new products and services to our customers that may require modifications to this policy. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time by notifying our customers, via the Intuit Web site, of a new or revised policy. These modifications will only apply to personal data that you then provide to us after the date of the modification.
