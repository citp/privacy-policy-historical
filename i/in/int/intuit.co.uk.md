**Using Your Data**  
It is Intuit's policy that you should know exactly what personal data we collect from you and how we will use it. We collect personal data from you for the purpose of processing your order or enquiry. We may use your personal data to supply products and services to you that you have requested, carry out any agreement with you or take any steps that you have requested. In particular, we may:

  1. Update you as to the status of your order
  2. Alert you to important product revisions or updates
  3. Inform you about upgrades to your purchased Intuit products
  4. Ensure that you are properly registered to receive technical support
  5. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service through our chat feature. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
  6. We post customer testimonials. We receive permission to post testimonials that include personal data prior to posting.



  
In addition to the above uses, where you have given us appropriate permission, we may also use your personal data for the following purposes and direct marketing ('Additional Purposes'):

  1. To tell you about special discounts on additional Intuit products and services
  2. To advise you about new Intuit products and services

Aggregate data is general data about groups of customers and does not identify individual customers. Intuit may combine your data with that of other individuals to create aggregate data which we will use to improve our products & services and develop new ones. For example, we may tell a third party how many people purchased a certain product, but not that you personally purchased a specific item.

You should also be aware that we may occasionally provide links from our Web site to other sites that we think will interest you. If you click on a banner advertisement or any other link, the 'click' will take you off the Intuit site. Once you leave any Intuit Web site, any information that you may have provided remains with us and is not forwarded to the next site to which you have linked. Personal data that you may choose to provide to a third party Web site linked to an Intuit Web site will be subject to the privacy policy of the operators of the third party Web site. Intuit is not responsible for the use or protection of personal data you disclose to a third party Web site operator, even if reached from an Intuit Web site.

The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [ukprivacy@intuit.com ](mailto:ukprivacy@intuit.com)

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [ukprivacy@intuit.com](mailto:ukprivacy@intuit.com).  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, conduct our business operations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

With or without cookies, our Web sites track usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer and what organizations might have an interest in our offerings. This data is stored in log files and is used for internal business analytics purposes. This log data is not linked to personal data gathered elsewhere on the site.  
**  
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.   
We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to track usage and volume statistics and improve our site.

These may be outside the European Economic Area and may not have adequate laws that protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

In addition, we will transfer/share your personal data as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.

It is Intuit's policy that you are kept in control of the ways in which we use your personal data for the Additional Purposes. All Intuit communications, in whatever medium, that involve the recording of personal data for these Additional Purposes include a short section that allows you to indicate your preferences with respect to the use of that personal data. You can choose whether or not you wish to receive additional information or promotional offers from Intuit.

  * To provide evidence of your order or transaction with us
  * To ensure that we comply with relevant regulatory procedures

  * To secure the effective operation of our telecommunications system

All information is collected and stored in a secure manner and is used strictly in relation to this policy and your stated preference. Intuit shall not be responsible or liable for loss of privacy, disclosure of information, harm, damage or loss that may result from your transmission of any information to us. In addition, under the law, we must cooperate fully with any law enforcement agency should a situation arise where our information about customers could be of assistance.
