         with tailored advertising;

                                       INTERMEDIA PRIVACY POLICY
If you are an existing customer, unless you ask Intermedia to provide you with additional marketing
information, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or by posting to your account with
Intermedia). Where required under applicable law, we will only send you marketing communications
with your consent.
We are committed to keeping Personal Information no longer than necessary to achieve the
purpose for which it was collected, unless allowed or required by law.
HOW DOES INTERMEDIA SHARE INFORMATION?
Intermedia may disclose your information, including Personal Information, as follows:
       To entities within the Intermedia group and third-party business partners, consistent with
         the purposes described above;
       Billing information to organizations such as VeriSign, PaymenTech, Signio CyberCash
         and similar organizations, who process billing information on our behalf;
       In de-identified or aggregated form to third parties, such as usage information to our
         service and license providers for licensing compliance, licensing usage calculation, billing
         and support purposes;
       If you purchase voice Services from us through Costco, we may, to the extent
         permissible, share with Costco your name, address, telephone number, email address,
         the Service purchased and the Service initiation date associated with your Intermedia
         account. Any such information provided to Costco will be subject to Costco’s privacy
         policy; or
       To vendors and contractors retained in connection with the provision of the Services or
         support of Intermedia's business. For example, Intermedia may use service providers to
         measure Service usage and Service performance metrics; monitor security aspects of
         our Services and infrastructure; provide data storage services; and deliver customer
         service or technical support. Intermedia will only release information that is needed to
         deliver the service for which the third-party vendor has been contracted. These vendors
         are required to maintain strict security and confidentiality of the information and are
         prohibited from using it for any other purposes other than in accordance with Intermedia’s
         instructions and policies.
In addition, Intermedia may access and release your information, including Personal Information,
under the following circumstances:
       In response to subpoenas, warrants, government inquiries, court orders, or legal process,
         including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; or to establish or
         exercise our rights to defend against legal claims, in each case if Intermedia believes
         doing so is required or appropriate;
       If we obtain your consent or permission to disclose or release your information, which we
         may obtain in various ways. For example, Intermedia may present you with an “opt-in”
         prompt when you access our websites or Services (including our administrative control
         panel);
       If we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
         activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, violation of our policies, or as
         otherwise required by law (this includes exchanging information with other companies
         and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction); and
