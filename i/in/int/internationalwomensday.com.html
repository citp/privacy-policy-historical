    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                
	        <p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
            
             <h3>1. What information do we collect?</h3>
             <p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:</p>
             <p>(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law;<br>
                (b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;<br>
                (c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); <br>
                (d) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling; and<br>
                (e) to any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal information where, in our reasonable opinion, such 
                court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.</p>

             <p>Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information
                to third parties.</p>
             
             <h3>2. Cookies</h3>
             <p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a 
                page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
             <p>We may use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the 
                persistent cookies to enable our website to recognise you when you visit.</p>
             <p>Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified 
                expiry date. </p>
             <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on 
                users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy 
                is available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a></p>
             <p>Our payment services providers may also send you cookies. </p>
             <p>We may publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These
                are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google
                will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or
                add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's Ads Preference
                Manager, available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>. You can opt-out of
                the Adsense partner network cookie at: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.</a> However,
                this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser
                your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in
                respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available
                at:<a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.</a></p>
             <p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to
                reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse
                all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block
                all cookies" using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have
                a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
             
             <h3>3. Using your personal information</h3>
             <p>Personal information submitted to us via this website will be used for the purposes

                (i) provide third parties with statistical information about our users – but this information will not be used to identify any individual user;<br>
                (j) deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website.</p>

             <p>We will not without your express consent provide your personal information to any
                third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.</p>

                of processing payments you make via our website and dealing with complaints and
                queries relating to such payments.</p>
             
             <h3>4. Disclosures</h3>
             <p>We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents,
                suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes as
                set out in this privacy policy.</p>
             <p><b>In addition, we may disclose your personal information:</b></p>
             <p>(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law; <br>
                (b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;<br>
                (c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information 
                to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); <br>
                (d) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are 
                contemplating) selling; and<br>
                (e) to any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for 
                disclosure of that personal information where, in our reasonable opinion, such court or authority 
                would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.</p>

             <p>Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.</p>
             
             <h3>5. International data transfers</h3>
             <p>Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between
                any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information
                in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
             <p>Information which you provide may be transferred to countries which do not have
                data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.</p>
             <p>In addition, personal information that you submit for publication on the website
                will be published on the internet and may be available, via the internet, around
                the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.</p>
             <p>You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.</p>
             
             <h3>6. Security of your personal information</h3>
             <p>We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the
                loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.</p>
             <p>Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot
                guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>
             <p>You are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. We
                will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to the website).</p>
             
             <h3>7. Policy amendments</h3>
             <p>We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on

                any changes.</p>
             <p>We may also notify you of changes to our privacy policy by email.</p>

             <p>You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you.
                Provision of such information will be subject to:</p>

                (b) the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually 
                 accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy 
                 of a utility bill showing your current address).</p>
             
             <p>We may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law.</p>
             <p>You may instruct us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes
                by email at any time. In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance
                to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes, or we will provide
                you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal information for marketing
                purposes.</p>
             
             <h3>9. Third party websites</h3>
