<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last revised on June 1, 2009</em></p>
<h2>A note from TRUSTe:</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.interfolio.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.interfolio.com/externalsitemedia/images/TRUSTe_CTV.gif" alt="" align="right"></a>Interfolio, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for http://www.interfolio.com.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.

If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe on line at: <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.

<p>Interfolio complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. </p>
<h2>Interfolio’s Privacy Policy </h2>
<ol>
	<li>We  do not sell, rent or trade any personally identifiable information you provide  when using the Interfolio website ("Interfolio"). With your consent,  we will share your credentials (writing samples, transcripts, letters of  recommendation, cover letters and other stored documents) with potential  employers, schools, or career centers, for the purpose in which you intend.&nbsp; Please note, however, that unless you  manually change your account settings, authorized administrators at your affiliated institution will be able to view your documents and delivery history.</li>
	<li>We  do not collect any personally identifiable information about you when you use  Interfolio unless you specifically decide to provide such. If you choose to  provide an email address as part of using Interfolio, we will not send an email  to you unless you specifically request an email response to a customer service  inquiry, or contact is required in order to protect someone's safety, or to  enforce our Terms of Service, or it becomes necessary in order to fulfill  service requests. Our site's registration form requires you to give us contact  information (like your name, school, address and email address). Your contact  information will be used to fulfill your service requests, or reach you in the  event that there is a problem with your request. Financial information such as  credit card number and expiration date is collected solely to bill you for  products and services, and only when you choose to provide it. Sensitive  information such as social security number is collected solely for identity  verification.<br>
		To change information that you have previously provided Interfolio, you may log  in to your account at <a href="http://www.interfolio.com">http://www.interfolio.com</a> and edit the information on your 'settings' page. You may also contact  Interfolio's Customer Support to change this information by emailing <a href="http://www.interfolio.com/file:/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Anke%20Mackenthun/Desktop/interfolio/help@interfolio.com">help@interfolio.com</a> or by calling 877-77-FOLIO (877-773-6546). </li>
	<li>We  automatically collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain  name, and access times. This information will merely be used to gather  statistics, help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web  site. </li>
	<li>When  you visit Interfolio, we place a small text file -- called a "cookie" -- on your computer that allows us to identify your computer during the time  that you are logged into Interfolio's system. You must have cookies enabled to  use Interfolio's services. We use cookies to improve the quality of our  service, and store your session information. Importantly, a cookie does not  allow us to obtain ANY identifiable information about you or your account.&nbsp; Some of our business partners (the Support  Center) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these  cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Interfolio only  and does not cover the use of cookies by others.</li>
	<li>We  engage in a contract with each firm that has access to an aspect of our system  and hold them to the same standards of privacy and security to which we hold  ourselves. Interfolio has strategic relationships with several firms to provide  technological services to the company. These include dedicated web-server  hosting, credit card transaction processing, and secure information backup  services. These partnerships have been created to offer the highest level of  security and protection for the data on our systems, and to offer our users the  best service possible. The service providers use your personally identifiable  information for the sole purpose of providing Interfolio with the service requested.</li>
	<li>If  Interfolio is ever sold, or all or substantially all of the assets relating to  Interfolio are transferred to another entity, we will transfer the information  you have provided to the acquiring entity in order to ensure continuity of your  service, and you will be notified by an email sent to the email address that  you have placed on file with us. </li>
	<li>We  recognize and welcome our obligation to comply with the law and this policy is  subject to that obligation. We will, therefore, disclose personally  identifiable information in response to a request from law enforcement  officials or as otherwise required by law, or if we believe it is necessary to  protect someone's safety, or enforce our Terms of Service. </li>
	<li><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
		If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we  will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your  friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Interfolio does  not store this information. </li>
	<li><strong>Disclosure to Third Parties</strong><br>
		Interfolio does not share personally identifiable information with third  parties except in the case described here. We use a credit card processing  company to bill you for goods and services. They do not retain, share, store or  use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. </li>
	<li>If  we decide to materially change this privacy policy, we will prominently post  those changes on this page and notify you via email at least thirty days prior  to using it. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your  information in this different manner. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Supplemental  Information</h3>
<p>Users may request that third parties contribute information to their file (ex, professor writing a letter of recommendation). Such information will supplement that information already provided by the user, and will be used in accordance with that user's consent.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at help@interfolio.com. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control: </p>
<ol>
	<li>In  general, access to confidential data is limited by user name and password to  the appropriate user, and only the appropriate user can authorize consent for  that information to be released to others.</li>
	<li>Please  note, however, that unless you manually change your account settings, authorized administrators at your affiliated institution will be able to view your documents and delivery history.</li>
	<li>Password,  document identification numbers and other sensitive are encrypted in the  database. </li>
	<li>Hardware  firewalls to prevent network intrusion. </li>
	<li>Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for all communication with the client. </li>
	<li>User  cannot see information to which he/she has waived his/her right of access.</li>
	<li>We  annually review our Privacy Policy, security measures and user access rights to  ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;We limit access to personal information about  you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that  information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their  jobs. </li>
	<li>We  have implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that  is required of every Interfolio employee.</li>
	<li>We  retain and maintain all documents you send to us in paper form for the purpose  of scanning them into an electronic form.&nbsp;  Thereafter, we maintain them in an electronic form.</li>
	<li>We  back-up this data by following established procedures for off-site storage and  business continuity readiness. Regardless, you should make backup copies of  important data.</li>
