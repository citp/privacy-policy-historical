              <h3><a name="2" id="2"></a>2.	Collection and Use of Information through Our Technology</h3>
              <p><em>Overview of the Technology.
</em> Our Clients may use our Technology to deliver advertisements that are intended to align with your current interests.  This form of advertising, called "Interest Matching", delivers advertisements that are more relevant, interesting, and useful for you. Our Clients may also use our Technology for other purposes including to help measure the effectiveness of a campaign or to optimize other campaigns. </p>
              <p>Our Technology is designed to facilitate the delivery of contextual advertisements by highlighting certain words or phrases on our Client’s websites.  It works like this: when a user scrolls over those words or phrases, our Technology then displays ads that are relevant to the highlighted text.  We may use our Technology to identify your interests by the words that you have recently seen and read while online, along with the advertisements that you have viewed and clicked on.  We may use this information collected by our Technology to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, for ad delivery and reporting, and other purposes. There is no PII transmitted or used in this process. For a detailed description of how our Technology targets contextual advertisements relevant to you, <a href="/advertisers/index.asp" title="Vibrant Contextual Platform" target="_blank">please click here</a>. </p>
              <p>You may encounter our Technology when you visit a web site: (1) where one of our Clients has enabled our text-based advertising solution; (2) where Vibrant Media, or one of our Clients, purchases online advertisements; and/or (3) where one of our Clients places a web beacon. </p>

              <h3>3.	Types of Information We Collect through Our Technology</h3>
              <p><em>Personally Identifiable Information.
</em>
 We don't collect PII via our Technology.</p>
              <p><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

</em> We may collect Non-PII via our Technology using cookies for many purposes including to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, measure the effectiveness of a campaign, optimize a campaign, or for operational purposes.   The cookie is used to collect Non-PII, including but not limited to, an anonymous and randomly assigned identification number, your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, interactions with an ad, Internet Service Provider, and your computer’s operating system.  We may also collect and maintain via cookies other Non-PII to create a data set of keyword interactions, also to assist us in showing you more relevant advertisements and help manage our advertising campaigns.  This data set may include a list of search terms that you use to arrive on our Client’s website, keywords recently viewed by you, the time and date you clicked on or viewed one of our Client’s advertisements, and the web pages you viewed after you clicked on or viewed one of our Client’s advertisements.  You may “opt out” of certain practices as explained below.</p>
              <p><em>Storage of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
</em> 
We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 13 months. After 13 months, we remove the cookie identification numbers and IP addresses and store it for up to 5 years. We store this information for 5 years as required for financial records for our Clients. </p>
              <p>For more information about how we use cookies, please visit our Cookie Policy <a href="http://www.vibrantmedia.com/cookies.asp" title="Cookies Policy" target="_blank">www.vibrantmedia.com/cookies.asp</a>.</p>

              <h3>4.	Disclosure of Information to Third Parties </h3>
              <p><em>General.  </em>We may at our discretion disclose PII and Non-PII (“<strong>Information</strong>”) to third parties when we believe we are obligated to do so by law, and to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. We also may disclose Information when necessary to comply with a court order, legal process or other legal proceeding.  Finally, we may transfer Information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>
              <p><em>PII. </em>We may share PII with trusted third-party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are limited in using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us. </p>
              <p><em>Non-PII.</em> We may share Non-PII collected by us with third parties. For example, we may disclose to our Clients that ‘blue banner ads’ receive more clicks than ‘orange banner ads’. </p>

              <h3>5.	Controlling the Use of Your Information and Opting-Out</h3>
              <p><em>Opting out from Interest Matching.</em> If you'd like to opt-out from having Vibrant Media collect your Non-PII in connection with our Technology for Interest Matching advertising, please<a href="http://intellitxt.com/opt_out/ch_optout.asp" title="Opting Out from Interest Matching" target="_blank"> click here</a>. When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your browser. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertisement campaigns.  However, we may continue to collect certain data for basic ad serving and other purposes such as counting the number of times a keyword has been clicked.  Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. </p>

              <p> 
                Although Vibrant Media’s Technology currently does not use your information for online behavioral advertising,  we support the cross industry, Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“<strong>DAA</strong>”) (for more information <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" title="About Ads" target="_blank">click here</a>) as well as the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Multi-Site Data, and, in particular, the use of the Ad Choices icon.
