              <p> Vibrant Media, Inc. (“Vibrant Media” “we” or “us”) is a Publisher-side Technology Company. We help many of the websites that you visit serve advertisements. We provide this privacy policy so we may inform you about how our technology ("Technology") processes information on behalf of the online advertisers, website owners and other businesses that use our services (our "Clients"). This policy also outlines our privacy practices on our corporate Website ("Website"), www.VibrantMedia.com. If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@vibrantmedia.com">info@vibrantmedia.com</a>.</p>
               
               
                <p>If you'd like to opt-out from having Vibrant Media collect your Non-PII in connection with our Technology, please <br><a href="http://intellitxt.com/opt_out/ch_optout.asp" target="_self">click here</a>. When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertisement campaigns.

                <p><i>Personally Identifiable Information</i><br><br>
This Website is directed to our Clients and prospective Clients, who are businesses. The Website is not directed to consumers. We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via this Website. PII is information that may be used to identify a particular person or entity, and includes, by way of example, name,  postal address, email address and telephone number. Generally speaking, we only collect PII on the Website when you choose to provide it to us and use that information for the purposes that you’ve provided it.  The following are some specific use cases:
</p>


<ul>


<li><u>Vibrant Media’s Inquiry Form</u> - The Vibrant Media Website contains an “inquiry form” for Clients and prospective Clients to request additional information about Vibrant Media’s products and services. The inquiry form requires web publishers to give contact information (such as name and email address.) Vibrant Media uses this information to contact such Clients and prospective Clients about the services on the Website in which they have expressed interest, and to help us provide excellent customer service to our Clients.  </li>

<li><u>Client Contracts</u> – We generally require both our advertising and web publisher Clients to provide PII as part of their Client registration process. We generally use this information to contact the Client if there’s billing or order processing issue, and to help us process invoices.  </li>


<li><u>Testimonials</u> - Some of our Clients agree to allow us to use their name and comments on the Website as part of testimonials. If you’ve agreed to have your name appear in a testimonial on this Website, you should be aware that any PII displayed there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this Website.  </li>




</ul>




                <p><i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i><br><br>
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") from visitors to this Website. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer's operating system. 
</p>



                <p><i>Cookies</i><br><br>

                <p><i>United States</i><br><br>

This Website is hosted in the United States, and any information collected or provided via the Website may be stored on our servers, currently located in the U.S. By using the Website, you authorize the transfer (if applicable) of your information to the U.S. and its storage and use as specified in this policy.
</p>


<p><b>Collection and use of Information via our Technology</b></p>

<p><i>Overview of the Technology</i><br><br>
Our Technology is primarily designed to facilitate the delivery of online advertisements. The Technology highlights certain words or phrases on our Client’s websites. And when a user scrolls over those words or phrases, our Technology displays ads. For a complete description of how our Technology works, please <a href="http://www.vibrantmedia.com/about/index.asp" target="_self">click here</a>. </p>



                <p>Vibrant aims to deliver advertisements that align with your current interests called "Interest Matching". Our Technology identifies your interests by the words that you have recently seen and read while online, along with the advertisements that you have viewed and clicked on. There is no PII transmitted or used whatsoever. The goal is simply to deliver advertisements that are more relevant, interesting and useful for you. You may encounter our Technology: when our text based advertising solution is enabled on the website of one of our Clients; when Vibrant Media, or one of our Clients purchases online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Clients places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit. </p>

                <p>We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p><b>Types of information we collect via our Technology</b></p>
                
                
                
                <p><i>Personally Identifiable Information</i><br><br>
We don't collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") via our Technology. 
</p>
                <p><i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i><br><br>
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") via our Technology, including but not limited to your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer's operating system.
</p>
               
               
               
                <p><i>Cookies and Web beacons</i><br><br>
Our Technology uses cookies in conjunction with Web beacons in order to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you.
</p>
				<p><i>Storage of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i><br><br>
We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 13 months. After 13 months, we render this information anonymous and store it for up to five years.
</p>

               
               <p><b>Controlling the use of your information</b></p>

<p><i>Deleting your PII</i><br><br>

Although we don’t collect any PII via our Technology, If you'd like us to update, correct, delete or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us on the Website, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:info@vibrantmedia.com">info@vibrantmedia.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.</p> 

               
               
                <p><i>Opting out from Cookies</i><br><br>

If you'd like to opt-out from having Vibrant Media collect your Non-PII in connection with our Technology, please <a href="http://intellitxt.com/opt_out/ch_optout.asp" target="_self">click here</a>. When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertisement campaigns. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. 
</p>


<p><b>Information Security</b></p>

<p>The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Website. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>



               

                <p><b>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</b></p>

<p>We generally do not rent or share information collected via the Website or Technology with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share such information with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us. </p>


<p>We may share Non-PII collected on the Website or via our Technology with unaffiliated third parties. For example, we may disclose that ‘blue banner ads’ receive more clicks than ‘orange banner ads.’ This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually. </p>

<p>We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Vibrant Media may also disclose user information when necessary to comply with a court order, legal process or other legal proceeding.</p>

<p>Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. </p>


<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p>This privacy policy is subject to change. If we make any material or substantive changes in the way that we use the information collected through this Website or Technology, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice of those changes on the Website and in this privacy policy. </p>
