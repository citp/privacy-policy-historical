what information we collect, how we use it and how to correct and change
it. Each time you visit any Site or provide us with information, you are,
by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at
that time.
</p>
<p>
This privacy policy applies to online data collection and usage policies
and practices that apply to this website. It does not apply to

may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally
identifiable information such as your name, username, email address, and
contact information.
</p>
<p>
We also collect information about how you use our site and the areas of
our site that you visit. Site analytics data is used to troubleshoot the

How We Use Personally Identifiable Information Collected
</h4>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose, display
or share your personal information to or with third parties without your
permission.
</p>
<p>
We use personally identifying information we collect on any the Site for
the following purposes:
</p><ul>
<li>to allow you to create an account and profile;</li>
<li>to enable you to provide feedback, to contact us and for us to respond to you;</li>
<li>
to provide information about you and your potential interest in job
postings to employer customers;
</li>
<li>
to provide products and services to employer customers to complete
the recruitment and hiring process, such as accessing the searchable
resume database;
</li>
<li>
to communicate with you with regard to your use of the Site and its
services or to advise you of Site changes or other events or
occurrences which may affect your access to or use of the Site;
</li>
<li>to compile information and statistics surrounding internships</li>
<li>
to administer sweepstakes, contests, surveys, questionnaires, polling
activities and other similar events and activities that you choose to
participate in;
</li>
<li>
to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
claims;
</li>
<li>
to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent
bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating
our&nbsp;Terms of Use, which may include sharing information with other
companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities; and
</li>
<li>
for other purposes specifically communicated to you when we collect
the information.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
If you choose to publish your profile, upload or create a resume or any
other document containing personal information so that employers can find
you in the InternMatch.com database, your personal profile information
and resume will be searchable by and accessible to employers who have
access to those databases.  Please note that for uploaded resumes on our
website, they must not contain sensitive data relating to your (i) racial
or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious
beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical
or mental health or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the
commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties
or fines, or (viii) any Social Security Number or state or national
identification number. In addition, if you provide us with details of
a professional reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the
person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and has consented
in writing for you to do so.
</p>
<p>
While we endeavor to restrict access to these databases to eligible
employers, we cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our
consent, gain access to these databases as well. Within your profile,
under the settings tab, you can make your resume and other information
private from our database at any time. You can also contact us to remove
your entire account and profile at any time. However, employers and
recruiters who have access to these databases, and other parties who have
otherwise gained access to these databases may have retained a copy of
your profile or resume in their own files or databases. We are not
responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these
instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes or other personal
information of Users by any of such parties.
</p>
<p>
With your permission, we may use your e-mail address and other contact
information to send you articles, profiles, industry news and other
career related information, as well as to notify you of special
promotions or additional products and services offered by us or our
business partners and advertisers that may be of interest to you. You
have the ability to opt-out of these types of communications both in your
profile and in every individual email we send you.
</p>
<p>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
our Site. These companies may use information (not including your name,
street address, email or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites
and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
services of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
On occasion we may employ other companies and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers,
analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card
payments, and providing customer service. These other companies will have
access to your personal information as necessary to perform their
functions, but they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your
information and are prohibited from using your personal information
except to provide services to us.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, we may also disclose personally identifiable
information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we
believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or
necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent or mitigate harm. We
may also disclose and transfer such information to a third party who
acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such
acquisition is by merger, consolidation or purchase of all or
a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, if Internships becomes
the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary,
Internships or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise
dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy
court.
</p>
<p>
All Users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or
distribute personal information (such as their e-mail address) to others
(whether in chat rooms, message boards or discussion forums, by posting
internships, responding to employers message or otherwise), that
information can be collected and used by others. This may result in
unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not
responsible.

Your California Rights
</h4>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p>
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business
with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal,
family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to
request information about whether the business has disclosed personal
information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing
purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of
personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer,
the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom
personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as
well as a list of the categories of personal information that were
disclosed.
</p>
<p>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the
above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public
(in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal
information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless
the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may
comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to
prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free
means to exercise that right.
</p>
<p>
As stated above, we do not share information with third parties for their
direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such
disclosure. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party
for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection
with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any
third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal
information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in
to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one
of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future
communications from a third party, your information will be subject to
the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not
want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact
the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties
use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party
that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle
your information.
</p>
<p>
California customers may request further information about our compliance
with this law by e-mailing
<a class="textLink" href="mailto:info@internmatch.com">info@internmatch.com</a>
. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per
customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made
by means other than through this e-mail address.
