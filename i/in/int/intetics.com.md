# Privacy Policy | Intetics

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting our website and showing interest in our Company. Your privacy is precious to us. In this Privacy Policy we will explain how we collect data about you, how we use it and how it is protected. Depending on your online activity, different types of data may be collected for different purposes and shared with different parties in various countries. Please find the activity which is relevant to you below.

## Terminology

A **Cookie** is a small file with a string of letters and numbers which is created on your device when you are browsing websites. Cookies serve as unique identifiers to distinguish your visits from the visits of other users. Cookies can also be used to store your personal preferences on websites or to save your login data.

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a regulation which was issued by authorized bodies of the European Union to greatly improve the protection of personal data for all individuals within the EU.

 **Legitimate** interest means that we can process your personal data if we have a genuine and legal reason to do so and that we are not harming your rights and interests. In our case, it means that when our website gathers information about your visit, we use this data for our legitimate business interests to provide you with outstanding software products and services. Before doing this, though, we also carefully consider and balance any potential impact that it may have on you and your rights.

 **Personal data** means any information that identifies you or helps in the determination of your potential identification along with any information that relates to you in that case.

 **Tag** is a piece of code on a website that sends information to a third party, such as Google Analytics.

## Activities

### Browsing the website

Here at Intetics we are devoted to providing you with only the best of what there is to offer. That is why we continually strive to make our website as simple and informative as possible. Another part of the job is determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising, thus improving our products, services, systems and relationships with you. For these purposes we collect usage statistics which are further analyzed and used to monitor your interactions with our advertisements and web pages. We also place social media buttons on some pages to let you share the content which you liked with your friends.

The processing of your personal data is based on one of the lawful grounds called "Legitimate interest". You can find out what it refers to in the Terminology section of this privacy policy.

Just as many other websites in the world do, we use cookies (see the Terminology). When you open our website, cookies are created on your device.

 **Google Analytics** component is embedded into all pages of the website. With the help of cookies it collects and analyzes visitors' behavior: from which sites they come (for example, from Google search results), from which IP and country, which pages they open, when it happened, how long they stayed on the pages, which browser was used, and which operating system and language. This data is highly anonymous and is used to optimize the content of our website. The retention period for this data is set to 26 months.

## International transfers

This website is located in the USA, so that is where all data collection happens.

There is no adequacy decision of the European Commission for the USA, Ukraine and Belarus, but we use standard data protection contract clauses for transfers outside the EU. The European Commission has adopted standard data protection contract clauses (known as the Model Clauses) which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. Please look at the chapter "How we protect your data" to see which measures are taken to respect your privacy.

## Your rights

Here you can find the list of all the rights that have been referred to in the other sections of this Policy. Please read through all of them or take a look at a particular section to find out which of these rights apply to you depending on the way in which you interact with us.

As a data subject (a person whose personal data is collected, stored and processed) you have several rights under GDPR:

If that is the case, you can access your personal data and the following information: (a) the purposes of the processing; (b) the categories of personal data; (c) to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed; (d) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or the criteria used to determine that period. If you would like to have a copy of your personal data from us, we will provide it if: (1) you provide us with a proof of your identity, (2) it will not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The first copy will be provided for free, and for any further copies we may charge a reasonable fee based on the associated administrative costs.
  *  **The right to rectification.** You have the right to demand that we correct without undue delay your personal data which we have in our systems if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
  *  **The right to erasure ('right to be forgotten').** You have the right to demand that we erase your personal data, and we shall erase it without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: (a) the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is was processed; (b) you withdraw consent on which the processing is based, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; (c) you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds; (d) your personal data has been unlawfully processed; (e) your personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation.
  *  **The right to restriction of processing.** You have the right to restrict our capacity and ability to process your data where one of the following applies: (a) you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are verifying it; (b) the processing is unlawful and you want to restrict it instead of erasure; (c) we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for some legal reasons; (d) you have objected to processing and we are verifying whether the legitimate grounds override your request.
  *  **The right to data portability.** You have the right to receive your personal data which you provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit that data to another company, where: (a) the processing is based on your consent or on a contract; and (b) the processing is carried out by automated means. Where technically feasible, you can demand us to transmit that data directly to another company.
  *  **The right to object.** You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data based on our legitimate interests. We shall no longer process your personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing of, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing purposes.
  *  **Automated individual decision-making, including profiling.** You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects on you. Please note that we don’t make any automated decisions including profiling based on information that we have about you.

You can retract your consent at anytime by submitting a request to be removed from our mailing list via our [contact form](https://intetics.com/contact). The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
  *  **The right to lodge a complaint.** You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes GDPR.
