# Privacy Statement « Intetics Co.

We build your trust and confidence with Intetics by promoting the use of fair information practices. We are committed to your privacy and are disclosing our information practices in this company statement.

Our Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with our Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the web pages owned and operated by Intetics.com. Intetics.com is operated by Intetics Co.

## Collecting Information

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer’s “Internet Protocol” IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any web site within Intetics.com, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor’s domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

## Use of Cookies

From time to time, Intetics.com may send a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies don’t damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of Intetics.com you have visited and to other similar purposes. This information is used to improve our services and make our pages better accessible for you.

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

## Information Request

We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict “No-Spam” policy that means we won’t sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.

We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Intetics.com products and services. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive mailings from Intetics Co., but not from other third-party companies.

If you choose to purchase something online, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address and other information. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related product and services, but will not be shared or sold to any third parties for any purpose.
