John Travolta And Kelly Preston Healing In Hawaii</strong></font><br>

When John Travolta and Kelly Preston were spotted together on the Hawaiian island of Kauai on June 14, it was a telling show of solidarity for a couple known to live fiercely independent — and distant — lives. “This is a very difficult time for the two of them,” says a friend of the couple, who believes the joint trip represents an attempt to repair their 20-year marriage in the wake of scandalous charges leveled against John, 58, in May.<br><br>

In an effort to repair her tarnished reputation, Courtney Robertson — the much-maligned fiancée of Bachelor Ben Flajnik, 29 — is planning to pen an explosive tell-all, revealing the show’s biggest secrets. “She felt like she was portrayed as the villain, so she wants to get her side of the story out there,” an insider tells <em>In Touch</em>.<br><br>

While in Paris on June 12, the 43-year-old star took Justin Theroux, her boyfriend of more than a year, to Le Stresa, the same romantic Italian restaurant that she previously frequented with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt.<br></div>
