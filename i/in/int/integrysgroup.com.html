	<p>By using the website, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Please
	check this policy frequently, as we may amend it from time to time to reflect

	information that you provide us on the website, as set forth below:</p>
	
	<ol class="siteSpacedList">
		<li>The personal information you provide us not only enables you to access
		various services offered on the website, but also enables us to provide
		you with better service. We may use this information to contact you to
		respond to an inquiry that you send to Integrys. 
		If you choose to communicate with Integrys by e-mail, 
		then e-mail from Integrys to you will be considered
		to be sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has
		access to your e-mail.</li>
		<li>In order to provide you with services offered on the website, or 
		to complete transactions or requests initiated by you on the website, 
		we may transfer you to a website operated by third parties that help 
		us provide services to you. In such cases, we will have agreements with 
		those parties under which they will agree to maintain the confidentiality 
		of your personal information and to use it only for the purpose of helping 
		us serve you. We only transfer or share information to those who have 
		a privacy policy at least as stringent or substantially similar to 
		Integrys.</li>
		<li>Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your personal 
		information to third parties without your written consent (which consent 
		may be obtained electronically, such as by e-mail), unless we reasonably 
		believe that the disclosure is essential to the conduct of 
		Integrys's business, 
		including but not limited to where such disclosure is necessary to (a) 
		comply with the law, legal process or our regulators, (b) collect unpaid 
		bills, (c) enable Integrys's employees or 
		consultants to provide service to 
		you and to otherwise perform their duties, (d) comply with interchange 
		functions, (e) obtain and provide credit reporting information, or (f) 
		resolve customer disputes or inquiries. We do not provide your personal 
		information to third parties for the purpose of telemarketing, e-mail or 
		direct-mail solicitation.</li>
		<li>You should protect the confidentiality of your username and password. 
		You are responsible for all activity on the website accessed by your 
		username and password. Access by Integrys's 
		employees or consultants to any 
		personal information you provide is limited to only that necessary to 
		provide the business service offered and to otherwise allow such employees 
		or consultants to perform their duties.</li>
