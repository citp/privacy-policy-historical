Inbox.com is a free webmail service from Inbox.com, Inc. We designed this service with both its usefulness and your privacy in mind. This policy describes the types of personal information we may collect and how we use it to provide Inbox.com.

By using Inbox.com, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. If we make any significant changes to this policy, we will notify you by posting a notice of such changes on the Inbox.com login page.

##### You should know:

  * We collect limited account information and store and maintain your account and email messages on our secure servers.
  * We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.
  * You can update your account information and preferences at any time.



To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time Inbox.com is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the Inbox.com service.

##### What Types of Personal Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

_Account information._ When you register with Inbox.com, we will request some personal information, including your first and last name, a user name (which will be used for your email address) and password to create your account. Your password will be maintained on our system in encrypted form. Just in case you forget your password, we also may ask you to choose a secret question and answer and provide a secondary email address where we can contact you to re-access your Inbox.com account.

_Email contents and usage._ The contents of your Inbox.com account also are stored and maintained on Inbox.com, Inc servers in order to provide the service. The computers of Inbox.com, Inc process the information in your email for various purposes, including the formatting and displaying the information to you, preventing unsolicited bulk email (spam), backing up your email, and other purposes related to offering you Inbox.com. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of your account. Inbox.com, Inc employees do not access the content of any mailboxes unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect Inbox.com, Inc or the public.

We may also collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of Inbox.com. Information displayed or clicked on in your Inbox.com account (including UI elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Inbox.com interface and better targeting related information.

Inbox.com, Inc will never sell, rent or share your personal information, including your Inbox.com address or email content, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.
