				<li>
					<h4>About Cookies and Third Party Technology.</h4>  
					<p>
						A "cookie" is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or open an email.  Cookies 
						are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.  
						Cookies permit a website to "remember" whether your computer has visited the website before and helps the website create a more personalised 
						experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed.
					</p>  
					<p>
						For a full list of all cookies used on the Website, please follow this link to cookie information 
						<a href="http://www.inboxpounds.co.uk/pages/cookie_info" target="_blank">http://www.inboxpounds.co.uk/ pages/cookie_info</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to cookie technology, InboxPounds® and our Advertisers use additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers 
						and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as anonymised demographic 
						information (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers. Cookies 
						and other tracking technology are collectively referred to as <strong>"Cookies and Recording Tools"</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your computer permits you to change the settings on your web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools. However,
						if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by InboxPounds® and our Advertisers, you may not be able to use certain functions 
						on the Website or on certain links to external websites. More importantly, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will 
						not receive credit for Offers or other actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity. 
						If you do not want to accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using this Website.						
					</p>
					<p>
						Except for essential cookies, all cookies will expire after the period of time provided at <a href="http://www.inboxpounds.co.uk/pages/cookie_info" target="_blank">http://www.inboxpounds.co.uk/ pages/cookie_info</a>.

					<h4>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</h4>
					<p>
						InboxPounds® uses cookies in order to track new Member registrations. This ensures Members are properly credited for referring other 
						Members, as well as to track earnings for our Advertisers. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Member Recognition</h4>
					<p>
						After a Member has logged into the InboxPounds® Member’s Section, cookies are used to remember their membername and Password so they do 
						not need to be entered during every visit to our Website.  Members can logout of the Member's Section if they do not wish to have this

			<h2>V. STORAGE OF DATA</h2>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>

				<li>
					<h4>Security and Servers</h4>  
					<p>
						InboxPounds® takes reasonable precautions to protect Member Data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and 
						destruction.  We use a number of physical security mechanisms (such as locks), electronic security mechanisms (such as authentication, 
						firewalls, passwords, encryption methods) and procedural security mechanisms (such as back up practices and rules regarding handling 
						and use of information) designed to protect the security and integrity of Member Data.  
					</p>  
					<p>
						The data we collect from you will be processed and stored on servers securely held by VISI, a Tier 3 Data Centre facility at their 
						premises at 10290 West 70th Street, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, United States (or by such other person / at such other premises as we may 
						notify to you from time to time), with backup data held at the corporate offices of CotterWeb Enterprises, Inc. at 1295 Northland Drive, 
						Mendota Heights, MN 55120, United States.

						By using the Website, you will be deemed to consent to the processing and storage of your Member Data as described in this Privacy and Cookie Policy

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Transfer of Member Data outside the EEA</h4>
					<p>
						The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may 
						also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among 
						other things, the fulfilment of your Account, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting 
						your Member Data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data 
						is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Policy and the Act.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Passwords</h4>
					<p>
						Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a Password which enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible 
						for keeping this Password confidential. We ask you not to share a Password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via 
						the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Member Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any 
						Member Data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Member Data, we will use strict 
						procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Use of Member Data for marketing purposes</h4>
					<p>
						You have the right to ask us not to process your Member Data for marketing purposes other than the marketing programmes for which you
