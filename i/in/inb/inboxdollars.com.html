<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Information Collected:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">The information collected by InboxDollars is used to better serve you. We collect your name and address to provide payment to you. Demographical information about you, including birth date, gender, marital status, and interests are collected to send you paid advertisements corresponding to your information. Since we handle all mailings, advertisers who purchase mailings do not see your personal information. The only time your personal information is physically given to advertisers who pay for mailings is when you select any co-registration boxes (ads for separate sites) on our signup form. Your name, email address, street address, city, state, and zip code will be given to these advertisers, so they can contact you about the service you have opted in for.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Means of Collection:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">At this time, the only way to become a member of InboxDollars is by filling out our signup form. Members will not be acquired through through purchase, other companies, or mergers. However, InboxDollars reserves the right to purchase email addresses and market offers to these individuals as a separate function of our site. These individuals are not considered InboxDollars members, and are not paid to receive these email promotions.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Use of Information:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">The information you provide us serves two purposes. One of these purposes is for InboxDollars to contact you regarding updates to our program and other essential contacts between the company and its members. The other purpose is to match you with paying advertisers using the demographic information you provide upon signup. <!--InboxDollars also reserves the right to sell your personal information if we feel your membership would benefit from that sale.--></font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Posting of Personal Information:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">InboxDollars reserves the right to post Member Information on two portions of our site. One of these named portions will be dedicated to listing the top ten referers to our program. Information that will be posted will include First and Last Initials, Member ID, and Signup Date. The other portion of our site where Member Information will be posted is on our Cheaters Section.<p>We have a <b>ZERO</b> Tolerance against cheating! Any member deemed to be cheating our program, depending on the seriousness of the fraud involved, automatically forfeits their coverage under our Privacy Policy. We hereby claim the right to post any and all information provided by any Member that has attempted to fraud our company. We believe this will make members seriously consider their actions before attempting to cheat.</p></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">NOTE: This action is reserved for serious offenses only. We will not post every cheating offense on this page, just the ones we deem to be malicous.</font>


</p><p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Cookies:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">At this time, Cookies are not used by InboxDollars.com. However, in the future, we may use Cookies to store information about your current visit, so that you need not be re-authenticated each time you perform an action from within our Members Section.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Minimum Required Age:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">In accordance with the <b>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</b>, Members must be at least 13 years old to participate in our program.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Subject to Change:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, as our company grows and our plans change. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time without notification to our Members; however, if any major updates take place, we will post this information with a pertinent link on our site.</font>
