<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>The InboundMarketing.com website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.

For example, if you personalize InboundMarketing.com pages, or register with InboundMarketing.com site or services, a cookie helps InboundMarketing.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.

<p>If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party.  If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the InboundMarketing.com website.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us via the form on the following page:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inboundmarketing.com/contact">http://www.inboundmarketing.com/contact</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
