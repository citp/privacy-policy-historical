## IV. COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY

  1. #### About Cookies and Third Party Technology.

A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or similar technology or open an email. Cookies permit a website or similar technology operator to “remember” whether your computer has visited the website, tool or service before and helps the operator create a more personalized experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed. (In all cases in this Privacy Policy, the word “computer” includes all forms and styles of computing technologies including but not limited to desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet devices, smart-phones, other mobile or wearable computing technology.) 

In addition to cookie technology, InboxDollars® and our Advertisers use additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers. These items are referred to as “Cookies and Recording Tools” as further described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. 

Your computer, tablet, smart-phone or similar device should permit you to change the settings on your web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools. However, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by InboxDollars® and our Advertisers, you may not be able to use certain functions on certain websites, services or tools. More importantly, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity. If you do not want to accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using the Service Platform. 

  2. #### Third Party Cookies

Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique Cookie and/or Recording Tool on your browser or elsewhere on your computing device to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These Cookies and Recording Tools contain no personally identifiable information. The Cookies and Recording Tools may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these Cookies and Recording Tools, please go to [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). 

  3. #### Referral and Affiliate Tracking

InboxDollars® uses Cookies and Recording Tools in order to track new User registrations. This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates. 

  4. #### User Recognition

After a User has logged into the InboxDollars® Member’s Section, Cookies and Recording Tools are used to remember their Username and Password so they do not need to be entered during every visit to the Service Platform. Users can logout of the Member’s Section if they do not wish to have this information saved. 

  5. #### Location (Geo) Tracking

From time to time, InboxDollars® may permit Members to participate in activities, or provide offers, that involve use of location tracking / geo-tracking technology, that will share the physical location of a Member’s computer or mobile device. For example, we may contract with a market research firm that would track a Member’s physical location through geo-tracking / mobile technology for market research purposes. A Member may choose to opt-out or opt-in to this experience and offer. If the individual opts-in, the Member agrees to permit location-tracking, and also may be required to agree to the terms of service of such third party. If a Member opts-in to location (geo) tracking, InboxDollars® may then share such information with any/all the third parties with whom it does business that request such information. 




in short:

Our cookies, geo Location, and other tracking mechanisms are used in part to ensure you receive credit from our partners & affiliates.
