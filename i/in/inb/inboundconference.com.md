## 1\. Use of the Subscription Service by HubSpot and our Customers

**The HubSpot Subscription Service**

Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and HubSpot itself) to create and share marketing, sales and customer service content. The Subscription Service can also be used to help organize sales data about a company’s sales pipeline (e.g., leads, customers, deals, etc.). The information added to the Subscription Service, either by site visitors providing their contact information or when a Subscription Service user adds the information, is stored and managed on our service providers' servers. This information is then used to contact visitors about their interest in the company's goods or services and interact with the company. HubSpot provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing, lead generation, and customer service needs, and we use it to meet HubSpot’s related needs. 

**Use by HubSpot**

HubSpot processes our customers' information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service providers' servers, but we do not have control over its collection or management. Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Service, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. HubSpot acknowledges that you have the right to access your Personal Information.
