# InboxLabs - Outstanging Email Marketing

The Privacy Policy covers InboxLabs' (“the Company”) treatment of personally identifiable information that is collected when the subscribers agree to receive e-mail ad messages from the Company or one of the Company's advertisers. This type of agreement on behalf of a subscriber constitutes a permission-based opt-in. The Company operates exclusively in permission based advertising and is compliant with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. 

### Subscription process

In order for a subscriber to be considered opted-in he or she must agree to provide their email address plus mandatory personal information to InboxLabs, including gender, first name, last name, address and phone number. The subscribers can volunteer additional personal demographic information, such as age, income, occupation and more. 

After the initial opt-in, each subscriber receives an automatic confirmation email. 

### Unsubscription process

A subscriber may unsubscribe at any time. Each email communication sent from the Company contains at least 2 opt-out vehicles, identified as hyperlinks or physical addresses of the advertisers or list owner. Also, the Company's advertising partner may insert an opt-out hyperlink. The opt-out is quick, easy, and also in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Opt-outs are processed no later than 72 hours after submitted.
