InjuryBoard.com is the leading personal injury legal site for consumers. However, InjuryBoard.com is neither a law firm nor a legal referral service, nor a doctor's office. As such, this site should not be used as a substitute for an attorney's advice or a medical doctor's diagnosis. InjuryBoard.com provides general legal, health, injury and medical information. However, our website does not provide specific medical or legal advice for an individual's specific matter or concern. Instead, the information we provide is general in nature, and you are encouraged to speak with an [InjuryBoard member attorney](http://firms.injuryboard.com/ "InjuryBoard member attorney") regarding your specific legal questions.

If you are concerned with a specific medical condition, we urge you to seek a doctor's advice. We cannot provide such medical advice to you. Additionally, if you have a specific legal problem, we encourage you to [contact an attorney](https://ask.injuryboard.com/ "contact an attorney"). As laws vary from state to state and change over time, only a licensed attorney can provide you with specific legal advice. Furthermore, please be conscious of [Statutes of Limitation](https://web.archive.org/topic/tort-components-statutes.aspx "Statutes of Limitation") in your state, the time periods within which you are allowed to bring a claim. There are sometime exceptions to these time limits depending on special circumstances, so consult with a lawyer in your state if you have questions about [Statutes of Limitations](https://web.archive.org/topic/tort-components-statutes.aspx "Statutes of Limitations").

[InjuryBoard.com](https://web.archive.org/ "InjuryBoard.com") allows you to [contact one of our member firms free of charge](https://ask.injuryboard.com/ "contact one of our member firms free of charge"). By contacting a member firm, you have not entered into an attorney/client relationship. Such a relationship can only be established after both parties have signed a written document. InjuryBoard member firms sponsor the efforts to create, maintain, and provide content for InjuryBoard.com so that users of the site may access important safety, legal and injury information that may be unavailable or difficult to find elsewhere. Should you enter into an attorney/client relationship with an [InjuryBoard.com member firm](http://firms.injuryboard.com/ "InjuryBoard.com member firm"), InjuryBoard.com does not receive any referral fee from the member form, nor does it receive any portion of the attorneys' or law firms' fees upon resolution of a matter.

A great deal of the information provided on this website is provided by our members and other third parties, and these parties are responsible for the contents of the information they have provided. InjuryBoard is not responsible for the actions and/or inactions of our member firms. Although InjuryBoard seeks only members who are competent, ethical, and experienced, we are unable to guarantee your satisfaction with any InjuryBoard member's answers or services prvided.

Furthermore, you are not required or obligated to retain the services of our member firms in order to use this website. Certain state bar associations may consider an InjuryBoard.com membership to be a form of advertising, and require that we inform our users that the hiring of a lawyer is an important decision that should not be based solely on advertisement. Such a decision should only be made after the review and careful consideration of a firm's experience and qualifications.

While we make every reasonable effort to provide useful, timely and accurate information, we cannot guarantee the correctness of this information, nor can we guarantee that we carry information on every conceivable injury subject. In addition, Although we closely monitor government agency initiated product recalls, alerts and warnings, we may from time to time be unaware of certain recalls and safety alerts, and encourage you to be vigilant in your research and use of information provided by government regulatory agencies such as the [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/ "FDA").
