### 6. Withdrawal of consent

Prior to processing your personal data the IFRS Foundation ensures that it is entitled to do so under relevant data protection laws. You may withdraw your consent to future processing of your Personal Data at any time.

From time to time, as noted above, the IFRS Foundation may send you marketing information and by providing your contact details through the Website, you are providing your explicit consent to receiving these. You may manage your preferences in accordance with your interests in relation to marketing and other emails sent to you through the [Manage Email Alert](http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/Register) tab of your user account at any time.

If a statutory condition applies allowing the IFRS Foundation to process your personal data and you withdraw consent to process your personal data, this will not necessarily mean that the IFRS Foundation ceases to process your personal data as it may, for example, be under a statutory duty to do so.

### 7. European Economic Area (EEA)

Please note that your personal data may be transferred outside of the EEA so that we can provide you with your requested services. Where such transfers are made it will be in accordance with applicable data protection laws to ensure sufficient protection of your personal data. If you have any concerns in relation to such transfers, please contact us. 

### 8. Continued Processing

The IFRS Foundation may continue to process your personal data after you have ceased to be a user of our Website, or if we have sent you any information requested by you for as long as is necessary and whilst there is a condition under applicable data protection laws and regulations which permits us to do so.

### 9. Surveys

From time to time we may ask you to complete research surveys so we can improve our products and services. Your responses to such surveys will be used only for internal planning and development purposes to achieve these aims.

### 10. Changes to the Privacy and Cookies Policy

From time to time, we may amend the way in which we process personal data to enhance the level of service that we offer to you. This may lead to changes in how we collect and/or use your personal information. Any such changes will be notified to you either at the point any new personal information is collected, or by us updating this Policy. You will then be asked to accept the new terms of this Privacy and Cookies Policy before you are able to continue using the Website.

### 11. Security and confidentiality

Any personal information you send to us will be treated with utmost confidence unless you are informed otherwise. 

Where you are required to submit sensitive information to us, e.g. banking or credit card details, we use encryption technology to minimise the risk of unauthorised access to and improper use of your personal information. However, please be aware that despite the security measures we have in place, no computer system is completely secure and there is always some degree of risk whenever personal information is transferred.

### 12. Monitoring of telephone calls and e-mails

Your telephone calls and e-mails to us may be recorded and monitored for quality control purposes. We may also intercept communications made to individual members of staff at the IFRS Foundation when this is required for business purposes.

You have a right to ask us to stop processing your personal data, and if we do not need to process your data to carry out a service for you or communicate with you; or as permitted or required by law; we will cease all processing activities immediately.

You also have a right to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you. We reserve the right to charge £10 to cover the costs involved and we will require valid identification (original driving licence or passport).  If there are any discrepancies in the information we provide, please let us know and we will correct them.

If you have any concerns, or if you would like us to stop processing your personal data or you  would like a copy of the information we hold about you, please contact us with your queries or request.
