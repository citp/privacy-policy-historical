**1\. What personal information do we collect and how do we use it?**

The Data Protection Act 1998 (the DPA) places restrictions on the processing of personal data by a data controller.

The Foundation processes your personal data for the purposes set out below. The Foundation collects personal information from you when you communicate with us using any media or in person. We may also collect personal data which relates to you from third parties.

Depending on your relationship with us, the Foundation and entities associated with the Foundation (together referred to as the Foundation) shall process your personal data for the following purposes:

  * the general objectives of the Foundation;
  * providing any goods and services ordered or requested by you; 
  * marketing to you the goods and services of the Foundation; 
  * providing information to you in connection with education or fundraising; 
  * administration and archiving; 
  * keeping you informed of and obtaining your views about the Foundation’s and selected third parties’ activities; 
  * processing information relating to the Foundation’s promotional activities; 
  * (if you explicitly consent) or we are otherwise permitted to do so under the Privacy and Electronic Marketing (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, sending electronic marketing communications to you keeping you informed about the activities of the Foundation or any of the activities listed here; 
  * processing any enquiries or complaints raised by you and responding to any communications from you; 
  * transferring to third parties with whom we have a business relationship; 
  * statutory and regulatory compliance; 
  * investigating any misuse by any person of our products and any accusation of wrongdoing; 
  * administration of an online application for employment with the Foundation; and 
  * providing information to credit reference agencies.



The Foundation will process personal data as set out in this Privacy Statement and its notification to the Information Commissioner.

Prior to processing your personal data the Foundation ensures that it is entitled to do so under a specific condition of the DPA or that you have consented to such processing. You may withdraw your consent to future processing of your personal data for some of the above purposes by ****[**clicking here**](mailto:mcorti@ifrs.org).

As noted above, the Foundation may send you marketing information and by providing your contact details through the Site, you are providing your consent to receiving this. You may express your preferences in accordance with your interests in relation to marketing and other emails sent to you through the “[ **Manage Email Alerts**](http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/ManageEmailAlerts)” section of the Site at any time.

If a statutory condition applies allowing the Foundation to process your personal data and you withdraw consent to process your personal data, this will not necessarily mean that the Foundation ceases to process your personal data as it may, for example, be under a statutory duty to do so.

**2\. Sensitive Personal Information**

Certain personal information is categorised by the DPA as 'Sensitive Personal Data'. In some circumstances, we provide you with the opportunity to inform us of your sensitive personal data, e.g. whether or not you are registered as disabled. You may also wish to inform us about your sensitive personal data to ensure that we can provide you with the most appropriate service.

We treat such sensitive personal data with the utmost care. By providing us with this data you are consenting to our processing it for the purposes for which it was given.

Please note that if you fail to inform us of any sensitive personal data which may be relevant to your circumstances this may mean that we cannot provide you with the most appropriate service.

**3\. Sharing Your Information**

We do not share your personal data with any third parties for marketing purposes. Please note that it may be necessary for us to share your personal data to provide you with any goods and services ordered or requested, other than marketing as outlined above.

**4\. Direct Marketing**

You have the right under the DPA to request that we do not process your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing.  If you would prefer that we cease to send you direct marketing information, please contact us via this [**link**](http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/Unsubscribe).  Please note that if you do so, the only information that you will receive from the Foundation are responses to requests for services provided by the Foundation.
