# Privacy Policy - iFunny :)

Last Updated: 10 December 2019

We believe that you should always know what kind of data we collect from you, how we collect it, and how you can have control over your data. We strive to be transparent in our data collection efforts and to provide you with the data that you need to make decisions about our collection of data from you. This is the purpose of our privacy policy.

There are certain things that you should be aware of when using our website and mobile applications. First, the iFunny website and mobile applications are publicly accessible and searchable to users and visitors around the world. This means that anything that you post to the iFunny website and mobile applications may be viewable by third parties. Second, since anything that you post to the iFunny website or mobile applications are tied to your user account, your postings may not be anonymous. If you prefer to protect your privacy while using the iFunny website and mobile applications, we recommend that you use the service under a pseudonym.

When you use the iFunny website and mobile applications, even if you are just browsing, we may collect some basic data from you such as the type of mobile device that you are using, your geographical location, and your IP address. If you choose to create a user account, you can choose to share additional data with us, which is outlined below. We also provide you with the ability to limit the data that we collect from you and how we use it.

We also use your interactions with the iFunny website and mobile applications to show you more relevant content. We may use your posts, comments, likes, and shares to determine what kind of content you are interested in and to provide you with more of it.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, how we collect data from you, how we use your data, or how you can control your privacy settings, you can contact us at any time at [support@ifunny.co ](mailto:support@ifunny.co).

## Data You Share With Us

We may collect data from you when you voluntarily share it with us. This may include the following data:

  * Account Data. You don’t have to create an account to use many of the iFunny website and mobile application features, such as viewing posts. If you do choose to create an account, however, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide you with the services that you have requested. This may include your username, password, email address, phone number.
  * Public Data. A majority of the activity on the iFunny website and mobile applications is public. Most posts are public, the iFunny chat feature is public, and likes and comments are public. iFunny may use this public data to provide you with the services requested, to provide you with more relevant content, to tailor content to your preferences, to keep records of communications on our service, and to defend against legal claims.
  * Private Communication Data. We may use your contact data, such as any data that you voluntarily provide to us like your phone number, email address, social media account handles, or contacts list, to authenticate your account, to communicate with you, to connect you with friends or other users, to respond to communications sent to you by us, to keep records of our communication, or to pursue or defend against legal claims. We may store and process your private communications and data related to them to scan for malicious content, to detect spam or prohibited images, to review content for violations of our terms of use agreement, or to respond to legal process or law enforcement inquiries.



## Additional Data We Receive From You

We may also collect data from you automatically when you use the iFunny website or mobile applications. This may include the following data:

  * Location Data. We may collect data about your location by collecting and processing your IP address and device settings. We may use this data to provide location-based services, tailor our services to your geographic location, respond to law enforcement requests, or to provide you with content that is relevant to your geographic location.
  * Technical Data. We may collect technical data about your use of the iFunny website or mobile applications, such as your IP address, your device IDs, your phone number, pages visited, referring web page, your mobile phone model, mobile charrier, search terms, cookie data, your operating system, your geolocation, and your time zone. We may use this data to analyze your use of the iFunny website or mobile applications, to administer and secure our services, to determine how iFunny should allocate resources to its website or mobile applications, and to understand the technical load on iFunny’s servers.
  * Marketing Data. As a free service, we rely on advertisements to generate revenue to fund the iFunny website and mobile applications. We may collect your IP address, your device IDs, your geographical location, your phone numbers, pages visited, referring web page, mobile phone model, search terms, cookie data, Google Advertising IDs, and Apple Advertising IDs. We may use your data to provide advertisements to you, to determine the relevance of advertisements, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements, and to help make those advertisements more relevant to your preferences.



## Use of Cookies

We may also collect data from you through the use of cookies and other technologies. This helps us understand how you use the iFunny website or mobile applications and to understand any patterns that may be associated with your use of our services. This aids us in developing or improving our services in response to your needs or wants.

We may use session or persistent cookies. Session cookies are only stored on your computer or mobile device during your use of the Services and are automatically deleted when you close your web browser. Persistent cookies are stored as a file on your computer or mobile device that remain on your computer or mobile device even after you close your web browser. Persistent cookies can be read by the website that created the cookie when you revisit it again. We may use persistent cookies when we utilize Google Analytics or other analytics providers, which are intended to track the origin and behavior of traffic to the iFunny website and mobile applications. We may also, from time to time, receive data from third parties including analytics providers or advertising networks such as Google, Facebook, or Apple.

## Marketing Communications

We may send you marketing communications if you have asked us for information concerning our services or if you have agreed to, and have not opted out from, receiving marketing communications. You may ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into your account to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out link in any marketing message sent to you. In the event we sent you marketing text messages at your request, you may opt-out of receiving marketing text messages by texting STOP in response to any text message received from iFunny.

## Disclosure of Personal Data

We only share your personal data in limited circumstances.

We may share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction.

We may also share your data with certain third parties to aid us in operating the iFunny website or mobile applications. For example, we may share your personal data with third parties, such as analytics providers, to utilize their software tools and measure the effectiveness of our advertisements. We may also share personal data, such as device IDs, with third party advertisers to help them determine whether they should serve an ad to you. The data that we share with these third parties does not include your email address, name, phone number, or username, but it may include your geographical location.

We may also share your personal data with our accountants, auditors, insurers, or attorneys where doing so is necessary to protect the interests of iFunny or to comply with any law or regulation.

We may also share your personal data with government or law enforcement agencies when we are required to report our data processing activities, upon receipt of an exigent circumstances request, upon receipt of a duly authorized subpoena or court order, or where doing so is necessary to protect our users, our employees, our contractors, third parties, or property.

Finally, we may share your personal data to a third party if we sell, transfer, or merge any part of our business or assets. In the event that we share your personal data in the sale, transfer, or merger of any part of our business or assets, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your personal data when transferred to the new entity.

## Management, Protection, and Retention of Your Personal Data

If you have registered an account with us and are a citizen of the European Union, we provide you with account settings that let you modify, correct, or delete the personal data that you have provided to us that is associated with your account. Whether you are located in the European Union or elsewhere, to stop our collection and use of your personal data, you need only to delete your account.

If you have not registered an account with us, we only collect technical data from you. To stop our collection and use of your technical data, you need only cease using the iFunny website and uninstall the iFunny mobile applications.

We may transfer your personal data to countries outside of the European Union, which may not offer the same level of protection. Many of our third-party service providers are located within the United States and their processing of personal data will involve a transfer of data outside of the European Union. Whenever personal data is transferred outside of the European Union, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security by transferring your personal data to countries that the European Commission has approved as providing an adequate level of protection, by using contracts approved by the European Commission, or by using US-based providers that are a part of the EU-US Privacy Shield.

We also put data security measures into place to protect your personal data. We allow access to your personal data only by employees and service providers who have a need to know or access your personal data on our instructions. We will notify you and any regulatory body of any breach of your personal data or our security measures if and when we are legally required to do so.

We will only retain your personal data for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected under this Privacy Policy or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

## Right to Access Data

If you are a EU citizen, you may have a right to request access to your personal data for correction, transfer, erasure, or restriction, or to object to its processing or withdraw your consent. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

You do not need to pay a fee to access your PII or to exercise your rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unreasonable or excessive.

To confirm your request, we may need to request specific information from you as a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to an unauthorized third party. We will attempt to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty days.

## Third Party Links

Our services may include links to third party websites and applications. By clicking on third party links, you may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party links and you are advised their respective privacy policies.

## Responding to Do Not Track Signals

You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Our websites are not currently set up to respond to browser do-not-track signals, but you can configure your browser settings to reject all cookies or prompt you before a cookie is set.
