_Personal information that we collect and where we collect it from_

Your "personal information" is information about you. Lloyds Banking Group companies get your personal information from you and others in various ways, including for example: 

  * through your contact with Lloyds Banking Group companies, for example in applications, emails and letters, during telephone calls and conversations in branch, when registering for services, in customer surveys, when you participate in competitions and promotions, through Lloyds Banking Group company websites and during financial reviews and interviews; 
  * from analysis of your payments and other transactions (such as the amount, frequency, location, origin and recipient) and your use of services involving other Lloyds Banking Group companies and what they know from operating your accounts or providing services to you; and
  * information Lloyds Banking Group companies receive from or through other organisations (for example card networks, credit reference agencies, insurance companies, retailers, social networks and fraud prevention agencies) whether in the course of providing products and services to you or otherwise.



You must not give Lloyds Banking Group companies personal information about someone else (such as a joint applicant) without first getting his or her consent for it to be used and disclosed in the ways described in this condition. This is because the Lloyds Banking Group company will assume he or she has consented, although the Lloyds Banking Group company may still ask for confirmation. Where you do give a Lloyds Banking Group company information about someone else, or someone else discloses a connection with you, that information may be taken into account with your other personal information.

We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for the maintenance your account, or for legal or regulatory requirements.

_How we may contact you_

Using your Email address for service contact

Making sure we deliver excellent customer service is very important to us and to do this various methods of communication may be used to keep you updated about your account. Most of the time we communicate by telephone or post, but we recognise that E mail is becoming a more popular process.  If we decide to use E mail to contact you, we will only do this if we have ensured that using E mail will not put your information at risk, or, if you have requested we E mail you, that we have explained the risks of sending an "insecure" E mail and that you are happy to accept that risk.

In addition you may wish to choose a channel of communication that suits you when you need to contact us.   If you need to E mail a Lloyds Banking Group company, we recommend you check their website to see if a secure E mail facility exists so that your E mail can be sent securely.  If you send us E mails in other ways, such as from your personal account, then remember that the message may not be secure and there is a risk that it could be intercepted.  If you choose to send an "insecure" E mail, please keep the amount of confidential information you include to a minimum.  With some of our products we offer a number of communication update services via SMS.  If you have signed up to this service, we may send you text messages containing administrative information about your relationship with us. You can ask us to stop sending these messages at any time.  Additionally, in extraordinary circumstances (such as natural disaster or civil unrest) we may also send you updates by text message or email when we consider it to be appropriate.

_Using cookies_

In general, you can visit Lloyds Banking Group websites without identifying who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However, cookies are used to store small amounts of information on your computer, which allows certain information from your web browser to be collected. Cookies are widely used on the internet and do not identify the individual using the computer, just the computer being used. Cookies and other similar technology make it easier for you to log on to and use our websites during future visits. You can find more information on our [cookies policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy/default.aspx) page 

_When you apply for and use our products & services_

Joint applicants

Sometimes, when you open a joint account or product, this may mean that your personal data will be shared with the other applicant.  For example, transactions made by you will be seen by your joint account holder and vice versa.

How we manage sensitive personal information

Data Protection Act defines certain information as 'sensitive' (racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life, criminal proceedings and offences). When you apply for certain product or services, we may ask you for some 'sensitive' information, but we will always ask for your explicit consent. As a customer, there may also be times when you give us 'sensitive' information. We will use it to provide the service you require and may share it with other parts of the group and our subcontractors to keep our records up to date.

How we check your identity

We may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open your account.  Alternatively, we may search credit reference agency files in assessing your application.  The agency also gives us other details and information from the Electoral Register to verify your identity.  The agency keeps a record of our search, whether or not your application proceeds.  Our search is not seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.

Undertaking Anti-Money Laundering checks

To comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. This information may be shared with other group companies.
