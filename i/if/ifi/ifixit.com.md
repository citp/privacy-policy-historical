Our Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission.

As noted above, we do not share your information for direct marketing purposes. But our lawyer said we need to tell you that California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our website who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties or corporate affiliates for those entities’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.

If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: iFixit, Attn: Privacy Agent, 1330 Monterey St, CA 93401. For all requests, you must put the statement “California Privacy Rights Notice” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. You also need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via telephone, email or facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not contain complete information.

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created. For information about DNT, visit [All About DNT](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/).

_This policy may be amended from time to time. Any amendments to our Privacy Policy will be posted as a notification on our homepage._
