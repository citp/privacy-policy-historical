#### Privacy Statement

We respect your privacy! We are firm believers in our customers' right to privacy, and adhere to the industry standard concept of Fair Information Practices. These Practices specify what information we collect from you, when we collect it, and what we're going to do with it. While writing these Practices, protecting your privacy was our primary priority- even at potential economic loss for us. 

> 1) **Data Collection Limitation**  
>  2) **Data Quality**  
>  3) **Purpose Specification**  
>  4) **Use Limitation Principle**  
>  5) **Security Safeguards**  
>  6) **Openness Principle**  
>  7) **Individual Participation**  
>  8) **Accountability**

1) **Collection Limitation Principle:   **  
When you visit our site, our servers automatically collect these pieces of information from your computer:

  * IP Address
  * Operating System / Web Browser



When you register or place an order with us, we require you provide these pieces of information:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Phone number
  * E-mail address
  * User name
  * Password



In addition, you may choose to provide additional information which may allow us to enhance your shopping experience such as:

  * Credit card number
  * Card expiration date
  * Card authentication code
  * Optional survey feedback 



All information you provide will be stored on our secure server until you request we remove it. We store your credit card information using encryption.

We do not collect any other information from you.

2) **Data Quality Principle:  **   
We only collect information that is relevant to our mission of providing you with the best customer service possible.

To provide better customer service, we strive to maintain the most accurate information possible. If any of your information has changed, please log in to the store and update it or contact a customer service representative to do so for you.

3) **Purpose Specification Principle:  **   
We do not use your information for anything but order fulfillment and customer service.

4) **Use Limitation Principle:   **  
We will not use your information to contact you (except as required to complete your order and provide customer service) unless you explicitly request that we do so. 

When you place an order, we provide your name, address, and credit card information to our credit card processor to validate and charge your card. When we ship your order, we provide your name, address, and phone number to our shipping company. 

We will not provide your personal information to any other third party, under any circumstances.

5) **Security Safeguards Principle:   **  
We take significant precautions to protect your information. Communications between your browser and our sever are encrypted using 128 bit SSL. Your financial information is stored on our server using industry standard strong encryption. Our server is located in a physically secure data center.

In the unlikely event that your information were compromised, we would notify you immediately pursuant with California Civil Code Section 1798.29.

6) **Openness Principle:**     
We aren’t trying to confuse you with a 20 page privacy statement that absolves us of all responsibility while removing any possible rights to your information you may have had. These are our simple and (hopefully) easy to understand Fair Information Practices.

7) **Individual Participation Principle:  **   
We believe that you own your personally identifying information, and have the right to control our access to it. At any time, you can log in and access, modify, or remove your information from our server.

8) **Accountability Principle:   **  
We pledge to adhere to these Principles. If you believe that we have violated these terms, please contact us and we'll do our utmost to rectify the situation.
