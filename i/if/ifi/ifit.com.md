# Privacy Policy » iFit Live

#### iFitLive.com respects your privacy. We have established this policy to define when we collect personally identifiable information from visitors to iFitLive.com and what we do with such information.

Privacy

Privacy refers to information that we at ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. ("ICON"), owner of this site, gather about you and the use that we make of it in the course of our business. 

ICON collects personally identifying information only during contests, sweepstakes and site membership registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of the site in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. ICON may use such information for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event ICON plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and can decline from having such information posted. 

Information submitted at the time of any form of registration may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by ICON. ICON does not share this information with other companies. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use at any time by written request. 

Registration

When you use a credit card to pay for any of iFitLive.com's services or products, we ask for your name, address, credit card and credit card-related information. Once you give us your name and address -- and log on to our services -- you are not anonymous to us.

This information is not shared with any third parties whatsoever. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is possible that some areas of this site will not function properly if you do so.
