> **The IEC may disclose personal data to third parties (whether situated in a country providing standards of protection similar to those of Switzerland or not) if the IEC is required to do so by law or if such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of the IEC, its customers and the public.** For the purposes of this clause, National Committees of the IEC, even when situated outside Switzerland, are not deemed to be third parties and you hereby consent to the transfer of personal data to such National Committees for the purpose of managing your participation in IEC work.
