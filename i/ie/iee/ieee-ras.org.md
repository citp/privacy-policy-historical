# IEEE - About Your Privacy and Cookies

IEEE uses (and, where specified, shares) your personal information for the following purposes:

 **To engage in transactions.** IEEE may use personal information such as name, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address. and company/institution to engage in transactions with you, including contacting you about your order, subscription or membership.

 **To process transactions.** IEEE may use financial/credit card and payment information to process your order. IEEE may need to share some of this information with delivery services, credit card clearing houses, and other third parties to complete the transaction.

 **To provide support or other services.** IEEE may use your personal information to provide you with support or other services that you have ordered or requested. In addition, IEEE may use your personal information to respond to your inquiries or requests for information.

 **To tailor marketing to your needs and respond to your requests.** IEEE may use your personal information to provide you with notices of new product releases and service developments. IEEE also may use your personal information to respond directly to your requests for information, including registrations for newsletters or other specific requests, or pass your contact information to the appropriate IEEE distributor or reseller for further follow-up related to your interests. 

**To provide online forums and social networks.** Some services available on the Web sites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, post comments, opportunities, or other content to a bulletin board or exchange, or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these services are moderated; all may be accessed for technical reasons. IEEE does not control the content that users post to these forums or social networks. You should carefully consider whether you wish to submit personal information to these forums or social networks and tailor any content you submit appropriately and in accordance with the relevant terms of use. You should also review any additional terms and conditions that may govern your use of these services, including terms related to sharing your personal information and receiving communications.

 **To administer product downloads.** IEEE may contact you if you download products to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process), discuss the downloaded products or provide marketing or sales information about related products and services. We also may use this information to confirm compliance with licensing and other terms of use and may share it with your company/institution.

 **To select content, improve quality and facilitate use of the Web sites.** IEEE may use your personal information, including the information gathered as a result of site navigation and electronic protocols and cookies (including third-party cookies), to help create and personalize Web site content, facilitate your use of the Web sites (for example, to facilitate navigation and the login process, avoid duplicate data entry, enhance security, keep track of shopping cart additions and preserve order information between sessions), improve Web site quality, track marketing campaign responsiveness and evaluate page response rates.

 **To assess usage of IEEE products and services.** IEEE may track your usage of IEEE products and services (e.g., IEEE _Xplore_ ) to determine your level of usage, and those usage statistics may be made available to IEEE’s content licensors and your company/institution.

 **To communicate with you about a conference or event.** We or our business associates may communicate with you about a conference or event hosted or co-sponsored by IEEE or one of our business associates. This may include information about the event's content, event logistics, payment, updates, and additional information related to the event. Information you provide when registering for or participating in a conference managed or co-sponsored by parties other than or in addition to IEEE may be shared with those parties, and the treatment of such information is further subject to the privacy policies of those parties. IEEE and its conference co-sponsors may contact you after the event about the event and related products and services. Please note that IEEE conference co-sponsors, exhibitors and other third parties may directly request your personal information at their conference booths or presentations. Providing your information to them is optional, and you should review their privacy policies to address your particular needs and concerns about how they will treat your personal information.

 **To comply with legal requirements.** IEEE may disclose your personal information to comply with laws, court orders, litigation or other legal process, and/or in response to requests from governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights or protect our operations or users.
