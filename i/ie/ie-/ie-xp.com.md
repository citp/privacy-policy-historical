**What Information Does resllercenter Gather?**  


When you register for a resllercenter account, resllercenter obtains contact information, such as your name, address, and phone number, as well as payment information, such as your credit card number. When you use resllercenter's service, our systems record information about your session, such as the dates and times of use, and the specific Internet address assigned to you. resllercenter also tracks requests you make for information on resllercenter's products and services, and responses you provide to resllercenter surveys. Finally, resllercenter keeps records of your payment history and communications you have with resllercenter's Support Team. Except in extraordinary circumstances (when we receive a court order, to protect the company's rights or property, or in emergencies where someone's safety is at risk), resllercenter does not keep track of what sites you visit when you are using the service.
