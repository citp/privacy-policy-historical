<h2>Your privacy is  important to Actions Microelectronics Co., Ltd. So we developed a Privacy  Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your  information.&nbsp;<br>
  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy&nbsp;practices and let us know if you have any  questions.</h2>
<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Personal information is data  that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<br>
  You may be asked to provide  your personal information anytime you are in contact with Actions  Microelectronic Co., Ltd. or our affiliated companies. We and our affiliates  may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with  this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide  and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.&nbsp; You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if  you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with  our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<br>
  Here are some examples of the  types of personal information we may collect and how we may use it.</p>
<h3>What personal information we collect</h3>
<ol>
  <li>When you are using EZCast/EZCast Pro related products, we may  collect a variety of information, including how you use the product, what  feature you use &amp; use time, device name, email address and location…etc.,  but not including some confidential and sensitive information like your name,  age, gender, ID number or credit card number.</li>
  <li>When you share your content with family or friends by usingour  products, we may collect your socialnetwork contacts like Facebook, Weibo…etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How we use your personal information</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted  on our latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. And  it will also be used to create, develop, operate and improve our product quality,  services, content and advertising.</li>
  <li>We may use your information to post news, updated information or  share content to your socialnetwork friends.</li>
  <li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send  important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our  terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your  interaction with us, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</li>
  <li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such  as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and  customer communications.</li>
  <li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we  may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</li>
  <li>We will use your information to reply your questions or help to  resolve problems you encounter while using our products.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>We also collect data in a  form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific  individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal  information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal  information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We may collect information such as country code,area code,  unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where our product is used  so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products,  services, and advertising.</li>
  <li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our  website, EZCast/EZCast Pro website, EZCast/EZCast Pro services, and our store  and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and  used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to  understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most  interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the  purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do combine non-personal  information with personal information the combined information will be treated  as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>Our website, online services,  interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and  other technologies&nbsp;such  as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand  user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and  facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We  treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal  information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or  similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also  treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that  non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy  Policy.<br>
  We and our partners use  cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the  number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and  measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. You may still see ads related to the  content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal  information.<br>
  We and our partners also use  cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use  our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to  make your experience with us more convenient and personal. For example, knowing  your location and language will let us deliver you the correspondingwebpage. Knowing  your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us  provide a customized and more useful web experience. Knowing your devices  information will help us to register your product and provide better customer  services.<br>
  As is true of most websites,  we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This  information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and  language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating  system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br>
  We use this information to  understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user  behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base  as a whole. We may also use this information in our marketing and advertising  services.<br>
  In some of our webpage or  notifications, email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content  on some websites. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a  separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We may  track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular  topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you  prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links.<br>
  Pixel tags enable us to send  email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail  has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Data Usage time</h2>
<p>It will start from installing  or using our EZCast/EZCast pro related HW/SW products, and will be expired  after you remove/uninstall it.</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
<p>At times we may make certain  personal information available to strategic partners that work with our company  to provide products and services, or that help our market to customers. For  example, when you purchase and activate your EZCast device, you authorize us  and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation  process to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account  will be governed by us and your carrier’s respective privacy policies. Personal  information will only be shared by us to provide or improve our products,  services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their  marketing purposes.</p>

<p>We shares personal  information with companies who provide services such as information processing,  extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you,  managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing  your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or  satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information  and may be located wherever we operate.</p>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>It may be necessary − by law,  legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental  authorities within or outside your country of residence − for us to disclose  your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we  determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other  issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.<br>
  We may also disclose  information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary  to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.  Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer  any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>
<h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>We will take the security of  your personal information very seriously. &nbsp;When your personal data is stored by us, we  use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical  security measures. When you use our products, services, or applications or post  on EZCast forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal  information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or  used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to  submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address  in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using  these features.</p>
<h2>Location-Based Services</h2>
<p>To provide location-based  services on our products, we and our partners and licensees may collect, use,  and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of  your computer, smartphone or device. This location data is collected  anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us and  our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and  services. For example, we may share geographic location with advertisement  providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Sites and Services</h2>
<p>Our websites, products,  applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products,  and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or  services from third parties. We encourage you to learn about the privacy  practices of those third parties.</p>
<h2>Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
<p>To make sure your personal  information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our  employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or  concerns about our Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to  make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.actions-micro.com">contact us</a>.<br>
  We may update its Privacy  Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a  notice&nbsp;will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy  Policy.</p>
