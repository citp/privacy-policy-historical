			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>

<p>IES must gather, store and use “personal data” as defined by the European Union Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in order to market our products and services to you. The collection and processing of personal data is subject to restrictions aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals.<br>
<br>
We are registered with the Information Commissioner Office and we adhere to good practice in our data protection policy, including adherence to the General Data Protection Regulations and the PECR guidelines for records retention. A copy of the data protection policy can be obtained from our website or by emailing <a href="mailto:dataprotection@iesve.com ">dataprotection@iesve.com. </a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;This privacy statement will describe the reasons why personal data is needed, how it will be used, who will be able to access the information and when it will be deleted from our records. It also explains your rights to access your data under data protection laws or seek to have it rectified or deleted.&nbsp; We will at all times comply with the provisions of the European Union General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”)</p>

<p><strong>2. Personal data which we hold about you</strong></p>

<p>We request very little identifying information from you and only for specific set of purposes.<br>
<br>
The personal data we hold on you is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Full name</li>
	<li>Company name</li>

	<li>To allow us to respond to your enquiries for further information; and</li>
	<li>To distribute requested materials</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, we may ask questions where you are not personally identifiable from your response although we may post responses on the Website. These instances will be highlighted to you but in all other instances, you should assume that we track any information you provide on a personally identifiable basis.<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Purposes of processing</strong></p>

<p>We will process your personal data for the purposes of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sending you marketing information out or;</li>
	<li>performing our obligations and exercising our rights under your contract of IESVE licence</li>
</ul>

<p>We will only process your personal data where one of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you have provided your consent for us to do so.</li>
	<li>processing is necessary for the performance of a contract [or to make preliminary arrangements for the creation of a contract]</li>
	<li>there is a legal obligation to do so; or</li>
	<li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by IES or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Third parties</strong></p>

<p>In processing your personal data for any of these purposes, we may from time to time pass it to our partner companies. A full and up-to-date list can be found in Appendix one.<br>
<br>
We will write to all third parties and ask them for a copy of their data protection policy. If we are not satisfied that they have sufficient safeguards in place for the protection of personal data, we will request a change in process or may switch provider.<br>
<br>
Because we want your experience of the Website to be as informative and useful as possible, we provide a number of links to Third Party Websites. Always be aware of where you end up. Third Party Websites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. We assume no responsibility for the information gathering practices of websites that you are able to access through ours, and we encourage you to review each website's privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<strong>5. Transfers of your personal data outside the EEA</strong><br>
<br>

</ul>

<p><strong>6. Retention of your personal data</strong></p>

<p>We will retain your personal data only so long as we reasonably require in light of the purposes for which we are holding it and all relevant legal, commercial and operational considerations.<br>
<br>

<br>
Where we hold your data with your consent, we will ask you to provide your consent again after 5 years. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you choose to unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from us your email address will be held on our email suppression list in order to prevent us from contacting you again via email. This is held under the Legal Obligation basis in order for us to comply with GDPR law.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
We frequently review the ICO and PECR guidelines for data retention.<br>
<br>
<strong>7.&nbsp; Subject Access Rights</strong></p>

<p>You have a right (referred to as the data subject access request, “DSAR”) to access the personal data that we hold about you.

In these instances your data will be removed within one month apart from where we hold your email address on our mailing list, where your email address will then be held on email suppression list, which we must hold for legal reasons.
