<p>We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, and otherwise in accordance with Data Protection legislation.</p>

<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
We request very little identifying information from you and only for a narrow set of purposes. Typically, identifying information is collected:<br>
<br>

<br>
The type of personal information collected on the Website could include your name, company name, address (including postcode), email address, telephone number (including mobile), user name and password.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, we may ask questions where you are not personally identifiable from your response although we may post responses on the Website. These instances will be highlighted to you but in all other instances, you should assume that we track any information you provide on a personally identifiable basis.</p>

<p><strong>The Way We Use Information</strong><br>

<br>
We may use information that you provide to better design the Website and to improve our marketing strategy and our products. We collect IP Addresses.&nbsp; An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.
