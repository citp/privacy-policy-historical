  5. ### **HOW WILL YOU USE THE PERSONAL DATA YOU HOLD AND WHAT IS YOUR LAWFUL BASIS FOR DOING SO?**

**_Client Data_**

    1. We hold and process Client Contact Data as a Controller, which means we must have a ‘lawful basis’ for doing so. We have set out how we use Client Contact Data along with our lawful basis in the table below. 
  

    2. Anywhere we are relying on legitimate interest we believe that such processing is necessary for the purposes of our **legitimate interest** , which in this case is to function as a business. We consider such use goes no further than a Client would reasonable expect; is likely to align with the Client’s interests (by enabling us to provide a sustainable business model) and is unlikely to be detrimental to the fundamental rights and freedoms of our Client.
  

    3. We may collect aggregate data about our Clients’ use of ID90T. Any such data will be anonymized and used for business and market research purposes.

**_Partner Employee Data_**

    1. Since we are acting as a Processor in respect of any Partner Employee Data, we will only use it in accordance with the relevant Contracted Airline’s instructions (for the purpose of providing the Ticketing Solution Services).
