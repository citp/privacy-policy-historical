### What kind of information does Idaho Power collect from site visitors?

When you visit the Idaho Power Web site, there are two kinds of information Idaho Power is likely to collect or track:

1\. Non-personal statistical information - this is, anonymous information on subjects such as: how many visitors come to the site, how they navigate through the site, which browsers they use, etc.

2\. Personal information you knowingly supply in online forms, registration forms, surveys, etc. When you sign up for certain products or register on the Web site to access your Idaho Power Company account information, IdahoPower.com will collect personal information to help the Company identify you, authenticate you and provide you better service in the future. This information is called "personally identifiable information" and is used to associate usage information with a specific individual or entity. Examples of personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, customer name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and account number.

It is common business practice to collect such information in order to conduct business and provide customers with specific services. Idaho Power has collected this information from customers in the past to provide services through the mail or over the telephone. The emergence and popularity of the Internet provides Idaho Power with another way to communicate with customers and meet customer needs.

### Idaho Power does not sell or trade customer information

Idaho Power will not sell or trade personally identifiable information to any third party without your prior authorization. In fact, because Idaho Power Company is a regulated utility, the Idaho and Oregon public utility commissions prevent the Company from doing so. The Internet medium will not change this. We only collect your personally identifiable information in order to provide you with better Idaho Power services.

### Receipt of customer e-mails

E-mail gives Idaho Power another convenient way to communicate with its customers. We hope to periodically tell you about new rates, products or services that will benefit you. Idaho Power will not, however, send you e-mails if you do not wish to receive them. If at any time you would like to remove yourself from any of the Company's electronic mailing lists, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/AboutUs/CompanyInformation/contactus.cfm).
