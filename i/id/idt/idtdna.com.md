## Access and control

IDT’s goal is to be clear with the information we collect so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. IDT wants to ensure the accuracy of your personal information and you can update your personal information with IDT at any time. However, because we keep track of certain transaction information, such as past purchases, for legal compliance purposes, we may not be able to delete certain information. To view or edit your personal information that has been stored online in your IDT "My Account", please visit the Order/My Account sections of the IDTDNA.COM website. For the security of your account, you will be required to sign in with your login ID and password.

Any marketing by IDT, or any third parties on behalf of IDT, will be conducted in accordance with applicable laws. Opportunities to select your preferences include the following:

  * The Order/My Account/Edit Personal Information sections on IDTDNA.COM allow you to choose whether you wish to receive marketing communications from IDTDNA.COM, and to subscribe or unsubscribe to newsletters about our products and services; and
  * You can also email Advertising@idtdna.com and request to be removed from our advertising and marketing lists (catalogs, telephone, faxes, and email). Please allow up to 10 business days for your email preferences to take effect. Because some promotions, such as direct mail catalogs, are scheduled in advance, you may sometimes receive solicitations after we receive your preference request.
