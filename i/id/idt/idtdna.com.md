## IDT online privacy policy

##### Effective May 2018

This online privacy notice (“Privacy Policy”) explains how we handle the Personal Data provided to us on websites and other digital services and products controlled by IDT that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, “IDT sites”).

This Privacy Notice does not apply to IDT sites that do not link to this Privacy Policy or to third-party Web sites to which IDT sites may link.

##### Types of information we collect online

The types of Personal Data that we may collect while you use the IDT sites are described in this section and include both information that you provide to us and information that we collect automatically when you use the IDT sites.

For purposes of this privacy notice, “Personal Data” means information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Data include name, address, telephone number, and email address.

##### Information you provide

You do not have to register for a service or program to receive much of the information available through IDT sites. However, some of our content is available only to registered or identified users and will require you to set up a profile or provide specific information about yourself in order to provide you the service.

##### Personal Data you provide when visiting IDT sites

IDT collects Personal Data that you provide on IDT sites, for example, when purchasing a product, to receive marketing products and information, contact IDT customer service, or respond to IDT questionnaires or surveys. This could include:

  * Contact information such as your name, address, phone number, or email address

##### Information that may be collected automatically

When you use the IDT sites, we also may collect certain usage and device information automatically as described below.

##### IP address

We may record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or other electronic device when you visit the IDT sites. An IP address identifies the electronic device you use to access the Sites, which allows us to maintain communication with your computer as you move about IDT sites and to customize content.

##### Cookies and other tracking technologies

We also collect information about your use of IDT sites through tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A “Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site, e-mail or advertisement that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you on the basis of “clickstream” data that shows your previous activities on IDT sites.

We may work with new technologies in future that require cookies or web beacons to provide their services. As we work with new technologies, their descriptions will be updated in the Privacy Policy. This IDT Site is not designed to respond to "do not track" signals received from browsers.

To learn more about cookies and other tracking technologies, including how to disable them, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. Please note that some cookies are essential to the functioning of our Sites and deleting or disabling them will reduce the site’s functionality.

##### Information collected from other sources

We may combine information about you from a visit to one IDT Site with information about you from visits to other IDT sites. We may also combine information about you that is collected through the IDT sites with information that we have collected offline, as well as with information provided to us by third parties, such as third-party list providers.

##### How we use your information

We use your Personal Data to provide you the product and services you request, communicate with you, improve your experience on the IDT sites, generally improve our products and services and for other internal business purposes.

##### Data security

IDT maintains reasonable technical, administrative and physical controls to secure any Personal Data collected through the IDT sites. However, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could intercept an Internet transmission, or that someone will find a way to thwart our security systems. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting Personal Data over the Internet, especially your financial-related information. IDT cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Data; therefore, when submitting Personal Data to IDT sites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.

##### Third party sites and social media plug-ins

This privacy notice does not apply to IDT sites that do not link to this privacy notice, or to third-party Web sites to which IDT sites may link. IDT sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit IDT sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our IDT Site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our IDT Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our IDT Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.

##### Accessing our sites globally

This site is owned and operated by IDT in the United States, but the information you provide will be accessible to our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers in other countries in accordance with this policy. Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international borders. The level of legal protection for Personal Data is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Privacy Notice in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you understand that your Personal Data will be stored and processed in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.

##### Notice to California residents

Subject to certain limits under California Civil Code § 1798.83, California residents may ask us to provide them with (i) a list of certain categories of Personal Data that we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) the identity of those third parties. To make this request, California residents may contact us at [dataprivacy@IDTDNA.com](mailto:dataprivacy@IDTDNA.com).

##### Changes to our Privacy Policy

We will only use Personal Data in the manner described in this Privacy Policy in effect when the information was collected from you or as authorized by you. However, and subject to any applicable consent requirements, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be reflected on this page with a new effective date. IDT encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
