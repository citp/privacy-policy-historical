We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, Local Storage Objects, or other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to and users of iD Sites &amp; Services, such as the date and time you visit iD Sites &amp; Services, the areas or pages of iD Sites &amp; Services that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using iD Sites &amp; Services, the number of times you return to iD Sites &amp; Services, other click-stream or usage data, and emails that you open, forward or click through to iD Sites &amp; Services. For example, we may automatically collect certain information, such as the type of web browser and operating system you use, the name of your Internet Service Provider, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, software version, and the domain name from which you accessed our iD Sites &amp; Services. We use this information to monitor and improve our iD Sites &amp; Services, support the internal operations of our iD Sites &amp; Services, personalize your online experience, verify e-signatures, and for internal analysis.<br><br>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Law Enforcement And Safety</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>We may access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect and/or content you and/or your student/child provides to us (including information posted on our forums) to a law enforcement agency or other third parties if required to do so by law or with a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Terms and Conditions of iD Sites &amp; Services; (iii) respond to claims that the content violates the rights of third parties; or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the owners or users of iD Sites &amp; Services, a third party, or the general public. We also may disclose information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of others.<br><br><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Service Providers </strong><br><br>
Information collected through iD Sites &amp; Services may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties engaged by us to handle and deliver certain activities, such as housing, meals, payment processing, mail/email distribution, software providers, and to perform other technical and processing functions, such as maintaining data integrity, programming operations, user services, or technology services. We may provide these third parties information collected as needed to perform their functions, but they are prohibited from using it for other purposes and specifically agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Some of these providers, such as payment processors, may request additional information during the course of offering their services. Before you provide additional information to third party providers, we encourage you to review their privacy policies and information collection practices.<br><br><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Business Transfer </strong><br><br>
During the normal course of our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity may acquire and/or acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through our iD Sites &amp; Services in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement.<br><br><strong>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy </strong><br><br>
Protecting the privacy of children is paramount. We understand that users and visitors of our iD Sites &amp; Services who are under 13 years of age need special safeguards and privacy protection. It is our intent to fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).<br><br>
Our iD Sites &amp; Services are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly permit anyone under 13 years of age to provide us with personal information without obtaining a parent's or guardian’s verifiable consent, except where:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">the sole purpose of collecting the name or online contact information of a parent or child is to provide notice and obtain parental consent;</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">the purpose of collecting a parent’s online contact information is to provide voluntary notice to, and subsequently update the parent about, the child’s participation in our iD Sites &amp; Services that do not otherwise collect, use, or disclose childrens' personal information;</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">the sole purpose of collecting online contact information from a child is to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child, and where such information is not used to re-contact the child or for any other purpose, is not disclosed, and is deleted by us promptly after responding to the child’s request;</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">the purpose of collecting a child’s and a parent’s online contact information is to respond directly more than once to the child’s specific request, and where such information is not used for any other purpose, disclosed, or combined with any other information collected from the child;</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">the purpose of collecting a child’s and a parent’s name and online contact information, is to protect the safety of a child, and where such information is not used or disclosed for any purpose unrelated to the child’s safety;</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">we collect a persistent identifier and no other personal information and such identifier is used for the sole purpose of providing support for the internal operations of iD Sites &amp; Services; or</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:30px;">otherwise permitted or required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we receive the verifiable consent of a child's parent or guardian to collect, use, and/or disclose the child's information, we will only collect, use, and disclose the information as described in this privacy statement. Some features of our iD Sites &amp; Services permit a child user to enter comments, such as forums and chat rooms, through which the child could provide personal information that would be visible to other users. If you are the parent or guardian of a child user, please advise your child of the risks of posting personal information on this iD Sites &amp; Services or any other site.<br><br><strong>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Parental/Guardian Rights </strong><br><br>
