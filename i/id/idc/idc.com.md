### Collection and Use of Personal Data

Our Website requires that users provide an email address, and other personal data ("Personal Data"), as well as information about the user’s organization (if part of a Corporate Account). The email is used as the user’s log-in identity when registering for an account on our Website. This ensures a unique identity and provides IDC with a method to contact users about service-related issues, as well as receive additional communications about special IDC offers such as Web Conferences, special events, and newsletters,   
**IDC is a U.S.-based Company and you agree that your Personal Data will be stored on our servers in the U.S.A.**

### Corporate Accounts

Corporate administrators ("Corporate Administrators") at our client organizations have access to usage statistics for their organization’s account base. If your user account, including Personal Data, is part of a corporate account, then a Corporate Administrator at your organization may access your user data containing Personal Data and usage information. Corporate Administrators can access user information only for individuals within their corporate profile.

### Cookies and Usage Tracking

Cookies are pieces of information that are placed on your device when you visit a website. We use several types of cookies, and each performs different functions.

You can change your browser settings to enable or disable cookies or to display a warning before accepting a cookie. However, keep in mind that deleting cookies will prevent you from using many of the features of the Website. We use cookies to maintain your log-in and access control as you move through the site. Cookies also enable us to personalize your preferences, including search, "myIDC", and "remember me."

We track your behavior on our Website such as search terms, documents accessed, and pages visited. If you are a registered user, this information is stored with your registration information. It is unique-number identifiable and is used to provide you with a personalized Website experience. We also analyze this data to improve our research offerings and make enhancements to the Website.

We aggregate statistics of the type of applications used to browse our Website and the regional source of that browsing, among IDC and other IDG companies, for analysis. This information is not personally identifiable.

### Purchases

IDC employs secure server software (SSL) encryption on all credit card transactions. The SSL encrypts all information you input before you send it to us, and IDC does not store any credit card data.

### Transfer of Information by IDC

In the event that part or all of the ownership of IDC, or any of its products are sold or transferred, all lists and data that contains Personal Data, will be transferred to the new owner.

We may use or disclose Personal Data if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary (a) to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) to enforce agreements we have with you, (c) to address fraud or security issues, or (d) to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of IDC, or our employees or customers.
