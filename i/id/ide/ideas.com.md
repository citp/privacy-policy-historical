  3. Personal Information



IDeaS never collects information for commercial marketing. IDeaS never creates individual profiles or gives your information to any private organization.

###  Automatically Collected Information

This information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use.

###  Information Collected for Tracking and Customization (Cookies)

A cookie is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the Web site that provided it, and no other Web site can request it. There are two types of cookies, session and persistent. Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time.

IDeaS Web sites may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your preferences for interacting with the site. A few IDeaS Web sites may also make use of persistent cookies to remember you between visits so, for example, you can save your customized preference settings for future visits. Each IDeaS site using persistent cookies identifies itself as doing so.

At no time is your private information, whether stored in persistent cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information. If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off in your browser. However, this may affect the functioning of some IDeaS Web sites.

###  Personal Information

If you choose to provide us with personal information, through such methods as completing a form or sending us an email, we will use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information or services you have requested.

Some of our Web sites ask visitors who request specific information to fill out a registration form. For example, clients looking for software, services or consulting information by IDeaS, may be asked to register to obtain email notices of product and service opportunities. Other information collected at Web sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, enables us to determine visitors' interests, with the goal of providing better service to our customers.

###  Web Site Security Notice

Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on IDeaS servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
