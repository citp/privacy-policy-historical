## IDEMIA Online Privacy Statement

IDEMIA, IdentoGO® (a division of IDEMIA) and IDEMIA’s subsidiaries have created this Privacy Statement to provide information on how IDEMIA handles personal information and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

We also collect personal information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect personal information to assist us (collectively “Business Partners”).

Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
