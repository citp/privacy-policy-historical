            <p> This notice is to inform you about the policies for collection 
              and use of personally identifiable information at ideaLaunch.com. 
              Sites which are linked to our site may have different policies; 
              please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details. 
            </p><p> 1. Your privacy will be protected. We do not collect personally 
              identifiable information (name and email address) about you on 
              this site without your knowledge, and all such information is 
              collected directly from you. You are not required to provide us 
              with this information, but if you choose not to, you may not be 
              able to participate in some of the activities on this site. 
            </p><p> 2. Personally Identifiable Information: If you choose to sign 
              up for the lifetips service to gain additional functionality, 
              we'll ask you to provide the following information: name, email 
              address, zip code, age, gender and country. We will NOT disclose, 
              sell or exchange your personally identifiable information to or 
              with anyone, without your specific permission, except when we 
              believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with 
              the law or legal process; (2) protect or defend the rights or 
              property of lifetips or others; (3) enforce this Agreement; or 
              (4) respond to claims that the contents of any communications 
              violate the rights of others. 
            </p><p> 3. Aggregated User Information That Does Not Identify Any User 
              Individually: We perform statistical analyses of the collective 
              characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure 
              overall demographics and interests regarding specific areas of 
              the lifetips domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. 
              We also use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors 
              as to the number of people who have seen and "clicked" on their 
              advertisement. In addition, lifetips may compile and disclose 
              aggregate information about its users for promotional or other 
              purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain 
              percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic 
              area or fall within a particular age range.
