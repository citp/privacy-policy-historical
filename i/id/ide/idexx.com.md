_Types of Information Collected_

You may browse the idexx.com site without providing any personally-identifiable information. In connection with your use of this site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about you. This site recognizes the machine name that has been assigned by your internet service provider, but this machine name does not provide us with any personally identifiable information (information that is associated with your name or identity), nor does this site recognize your individually identifiable e-mail address. Therefore, your individually identifiable e-mail address or other personally identifiable information will not be captured or stored for future use, unless you submit such information to IDEXX by voluntarily completing a registration form or posting a message to IDEXX. This registration information may include your name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, e-mail address, information about your company or organization, and other information needed for a particular IDEXX program, promotion, or service. To help IDEXX improve the experience of using this site, IDEXX may, through the use of "cookies" or other available technology, use a non-individually identifiable machine name to track how users navigate through the site. Cookies are small files that are stored on a user's computer and are designed to help a Web site operator determine that a particular user has visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. These files are used to measure which pages are viewed, time spent on certain pages, and determining whether a browser has visited the site before. We may also use memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the user of certain IDEXX Web applications. If you are a registered user of a site providing a service to IDEXX customers (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using the site and to permit your user login to be continuous through the site (without additional logins). If you reject the cookie, you may still use the IDEXX Web site, but may not have access to or use of certain services. IDEXX controls all cookies on its site. At this time, NO OTHER COMPANIES use cookies on the IDEXX Web site. Information may be collected and maintained directly by IDEXX, an IDEXX subsidiary, or by a service contractor operating under our instructions and subject to this privacy policy.

_Use of Information_

Information collected by IDEXX or submitted upon registration or during your use of this site is used solely for responding to your request for products, services, or information, or for internal purposes including, without limitation, marketing, promotional, customer support, Web site administration, and feedback purposes. If you supply a mailing address or telephone or facsimile number during your use of the site, you may receive periodic mailings, telephone calls or facsimiles, whichever the case may be, with information on new IDEXX products and services or upcoming events. We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about customers, sales or Web site traffic and provide this information to third parties on a non-personally identifiable (aggregated) basis. All information pertaining to Web site users may be processed in countries other than your country of residence, and all information may be transferred to, processed in, or redisclosed within the United States or other countries that may not meet some countries' legal standards for data protection.

_Disclosure of Information_

Information may be exchanged among IDEXX, its subsidiaries, and service providers as needed to fulfill users' requests. IDEXX does not sell e-mail addresses, telephone or facsimile numbers, or other personally identifiable information to other companies. We may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm, or in accordance with your instructions.

##### 2\. Choice

If you object to the use by IDEXX, its subsidiaries, or service providers of information collected or submitted during your use of this site for the purposes described above, or if you do not wish to receive mail, e-mail, telephone calls, or faxes about IDEXX products or services, you may request IDEXX to stop such use, mailings or telephone calls by notifying the Webmaster at [webmaster@idexx.com](mailto:webmaster@idexx.com) or at an address or telephone or facsimile number specified above. E-mails sent on our behalf include instructions for unsubscribing from our e-mail distribution lists.

##### 3\. Access and Update

At any time after you have registered on this site or otherwise submitted personally identifiable information to this site, you may contact us at [webmaster@idexx.com](mailto:webmaster@idexx.com) or at an address or telephone or facsimile number specified above to request access to information we have collected regarding you or your business or to notify us of changes to such information. If you request any such changes, we will contact you by e-mail or facsimile to confirm those changes. Once confirmed, any new item or information will replace the corresponding information previously provided.

##### 4\. Security

If you provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.

We use physical, procedural, and technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of individually-identifiable information. We instruct our employees that information must be handled in accordance with this privacy policy, and any misuse by employees is subject to disciplinary action.

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit sensitive information at your own risk.

##### Changes to Privacy Policy

It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without notice. Visitors should view this page from time to time to review the then-current policy. This policy was posted on September 11, 2002.
