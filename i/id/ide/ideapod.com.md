 **Information We Collect**

Personal Information

As you use the Site, IDEAPOD may ask you for certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, postal address, and telephone number. Such information is provided voluntarily by you. In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or providing any of the above personal information about yourself; however, you must provide personal information in order to subscribe to IDEAPOD email alerts or register with the Site.

When you subscribe to IDEAPOD’s paid content and set up an account, we also may ask you for additional information to complete the transaction and register you for the paid content, including, without limitation, your name, birthdate, mailing and billing address, zip code, phone number, email address, and credit card information.

 **Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies**

Like many websites, IDEAPOD uses cookies and other tracking technologies to collect general, non-personally identifiable information about Site visitors. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. IDEAPOD uses cookies and other tracking technologies in order to improve the Site by providing aggregate information on the number of visitors and usage patterns, to allow us to recognize you when you revisit the Site to provide you with customized information and to remember your preferences, and to provide you with information that may be relevant to you from IDEAPOD or our advertising partners.

IDEAPOD may collect user personally identifiable information over time and across third-party websites, and we may permit third parties to gather information passively on the Site for behavioral advertising purposes.

We utilize third-party advertising companies to place advertisements on our website. These companies may implement cookies and other online tracking technologies to determine information about your visits to this website to determine what advertisements to show you.

You can control many tracking tools, including cookies, from your browser. In particular, you may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to the Site.

Under California law, a California resident with whom IDEAPOD has an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to any personal information IDEAPOD may have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

IDEAPOD has implemented certain procedural, technical and physical security measures to help protect against the risk of loss, misuse, and alteration of sensitive information that you provide. We require third parties with whom we share personally identifiable information to do the same. Nevertheless, such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse, or alteration of information on the Site, and IDEAPOD is not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such security failures. By using the Site, you understand that there is a risk that data and communications, including email and other electronic communications, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties. The foregoing does not affect any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

IDEAPOD email subscribers may review or modify their contact information on file by accessing their account online. Subscribers of paid content may also review or modify their contact information on file by accessing their account online. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

The Site is operated in the United States and is intended for users located in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States.
