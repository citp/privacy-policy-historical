This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States.
  * ****Preventing Fraud and Other Illegal Activity.  ****We may also share Personal Information about Organizations and Individual Users when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect both ourselves and you from people violating our Agreement.  This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities as required by Law.

### 3\. YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION

You can review and change your Personal Information by logging into the Site and visiting your account profile page.

If you are an Individual User, Idealist may share your information either with your consent, or as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  If you have an Organization account in the capacity of a non-profit for the purposes of hiring employees with Idealist, all information you share, including your organization profile, and all Listings you post, in addition to any of your Contributions, may be viewable through or shared within our Offerings.

Here are some additional things to remember:

  * Information you make available to others might be re-shared or copied by those individuals and organizations.
  * We may provide you with real-time chat features and enable your ability to connect with other Users in our Mobile App and other Offerings.
  * We may provide you with discussion or comment features for your use.  In the event you voluntarily disclose Personal Information using an Offering, that information, along with any content in your Contribution, communication or post, can be collected, correlated, and used by others.  This may result in unsolicited messages from or improper and unauthorized use of your Personal Information by third parties.  Such activities are beyond our control, and by using our Offering you acknowledge that such publically posted Contributions may be copied or stored by other Users or third-parties.
  * There are no privacy settings for certain types of information that you post on a Site or a Mobile App, such as Listings and organization pages.  This information is public for all members of the Internet, regardless of Idealist membership status.  Please do not post a Listing or onto an organization page if you desire private treatment for such posted information.



### 4\. THIRD PARTY LINKS

We may provide links within an Offering to other sites of interest.  We do not endorse the content of these sites or guarantee that they will abide by this Privacy Policy or the other standards outlined in our Agreement.  Your use of such linked sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of the providers of those sites.  We encourage our Users to be aware when they leave an Offering of ours to read the terms of use and privacy policies of each site that collects your Personal Information.

### 5\. DATA SECURITY & HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.  Any payment transactions will be encrypted.  In the case that it is stored by any third parties that we use, your account information may be stored on a secured server behind a firewall.  When you enter sensitive information (like your password), the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Please note however that despite the implementation of the above security policies, Idealist cannot guarantee that these security measures will prevent other third parties from unauthorized and unlawful access, use, alteration and disclosure of your Personal Information. As such, any transmission of your Personal Information to us is at your own risk.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or Mobile Apps, you are responsible for keeping such password(s) confidential.  We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone, and refresh such password(s) as is deemed prudent.  You can reduce the inherent risks associated with using the Internet by exercising common sense and discretion: for example, you should choose a strong password, use different passwords for different websites and services, and use updated antivirus software.

We do our best to keep your information secure, but you must actively participate in the process of keeping your information safe.  We reserve the right to analyze accounts for fraudulent or irregular behavior and we may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse.  We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our Offerings, like message boards.  The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our Site(s) and Mobile Apps.  Please timely report any security violations to us as outlined in the section below.

### 6\. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may change this Privacy Policy or other parts of our Agreement from time to time.  If we do make a change to this Agreement, we will announce and post such revisions on our Sites and Mobile Apps.  We encourage you to review our Agreement periodically.  If you continue to use our Offerings after the announcement of any policy revisions, you will be deemed to have agreed to the changed terms and practices.  Questions, comments, or complaints about our Privacy Policy or the rest of our Agreement should be submitted to us by one of the methods listed above.

## B. EU GDPR POLICY

To the that extent you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you should read and consider this EU GDPR Policy which sets out the rights you have in relation to your Personal Information and explains how we will process your Personal Information under the applicable European Data Protection Legislation. This EU GDPR Policy only applies to our Users who are located in the EEA and should be read in conjunction with our [Terms of Service](http://info.idealist.org/terms-and-conditions/), [Cookie Policy](http://info.idealist.org/cookie-policy/) and General Privacy Policy (see section (A) above)  (all collectively, being our “ **Agreement** “).  All of our other Users who are not located in the EEA should look to our General Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and our Terms of Service for guidance.  For any person within the EEA, by using or accessing any of our Offerings you agree to the terms of our Agreement, including this EU GDPR Policy.

### 2\. REASONS FOR USING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

In order to facilitate your use of our Offerings, Idealist may need to use the Personal Information you have supplied us for both legal and legitimate business reasons.  We collect and process your Personal Information for the following reasons:

(a) Fulfillment of Our Obligations to You.  In order to properly supply our Offerings to you, Idealist is obligated to supply services that are compliant with various laws, rules, regulations and contracts.  We may be required to take additional steps to perfect your requests of us, such as introducing you to other Users on our Site or Mobile App.  We may have other legitimate interests for processing your information in pursuit of supplying you the Offerings you request, ranging from sending you updates or notifications about the Offerings you have requested or purchased to the protection of our Offerings and you from fraud or other criminal activity.  Please note that you cannot opt-out of announcements, which are not primarily promotional in nature without deactivating your account.  Lastly, we use third-party service providers to facilitate our supplying you our Offerings.  On a limited basis, we may transfer your information to certain third-party suppliers that aid our maintaining a safe environment for and allow us to offer quality services to our Users. (b) Legal Obligations.  Idealist has legal obligations that require it to adhere to certain recordkeeping and document retention standards, which shall include keeping user Personal Information to remain legally compliant.  Idealist reserves the right to keep any information in our archives that we deem necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

(c) With Your Consent.  When required by law, Idealist will rely upon your consent to process your information, such as for marketing new services to you.  We use a number of mechanisms to obtain your consent.  If you feel we are using your information without your consent, please use the opt-out mechanisms offered, such as our “unsubscribe” links found at the bottom of our marketing materials.  If the opt-our mechanisms are not satisfactory, please contact us for additional assistance using this [Web Form](https://app.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/fa2dd5e0-528d-4e14-8a38-50e59ddafed0) _.   _All Users are kindly requested to note that if we have collected and processed your Personal Information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent, including, without limitation, the fulfillment of any of our legal obligations and record retention requirements.

### 3\. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collect it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any obligations to you. As a matter of practice, we retain Personal Information belonging to data subjects for a duration which is determined by considering the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, any limitation periods within which claims might be made and retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators, professional bodies or associations.

### 4\. YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE EU GDPR

In addition to the other rights you may have under our Agreement, under the European Data Protection Legislation, you, as a User located in the EEA have the right to:

a) request access to your Personal Information;
b) receive a copy of the Personal Information that you have provided to Idealist in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format so that you can share it with others;
c) where Personal Information is inaccurate or incomplete, ask for Personal Information to be rectified or completed;
d) request the transfer of your Personal Information to another party;
e) ask that Personal Information be erased;
f) make a complaint to a European data protection authority about the manner in which Idealist processes your Personal Information;
g) object to us processing your Personal Information by asking for the processing of that Personal Information to be restricted or stopped. For example, if Idealist uses Personal Information for marketing purposes; and
h) withdraw your consent to processing, in the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your Personal Information for a specific purpose. Once Idealist has received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, they will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless they have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing of Personal Information based on your consent before its withdrawal.


### 5\. TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE EU

The Personal Information we collect about you may be transferred to and stored at, one or more countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Ås there is not an adequacy decision by the European Commission with respect to countries outside the EEA, such countries may not provide the same level of protection for your Personal Information. However, to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate level of protection we are actively working towards adopting appropriate protective measures to ensure that your Personal Information is treated in a way that is consistent with and which respects European Data Protection Legislation.

If you provide your Personal Information to us in circumstances where our processing of it is subject to European Data Protection Legislation, please note that you are doing so on the basis that you explicitly consent to the transfer of your data outside the EEA. The potential consequence of you explicitly consenting to this are that there is a risk that your Personal Information will not be protected in a manner that complies with European Data Protection Legislation. You can withdraw your consent for this reason at any time by contacting us using this [Web Form](https://app.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/fa2dd5e0-528d-4e14-8a38-50e59ddafed0). Withdrawing your consent will not affect our use of the Personal Information prior to your withdrawing that consent but it will mean that we will not be able to contact you about the services we may be able to offer you in the future.

If you require further information about these protective measures, you can request it from Idealist’s data protection office, the details of which are set out under section C below.

### 6\. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
