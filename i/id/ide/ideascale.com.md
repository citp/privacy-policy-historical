  If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We will also use this information to send you 'Service-related Communications' (see 'Communication from the Site').  These include email confirmations of billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations. Please see 'Contact Us' below.

  Preferences: profile information that categorizes how the software is utilized

  Details of the user profile are used to contact the user (see 'Communication from the Site') and provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site.

  **Uses of Information**

  The IdeaScale service is a web-based service for collection feedback. Any information shared with the IdeaScale service during the creation of a community is owned solely by the administrator of that community. By the nature or how our service works, communities need to be shared via a URL on the Internet. We provide the option to password protect your community if they contain sensitive content.

  Email addresses uploaded to the system for the purpose of sending invitations and email communication are owned solely by the community administrator. We will never share any information uploaded to the system with any 3rd parties.

  Data collected through communities is owned solely by the community administrator. By default, the data is only accessible by providing a username and password and logging into the site. There is the option to share online reports via a URL from the administrative account. The community administrator controls this option. We will never use any of the data collected.

  IdeaScale may collect the Internet protocol address (the IP address) that is publicly available on your computer. The IP address is not collected for the purpose of tracking or monitoring your activity on the Internet. In non-United States jurisdictions an IP address may be classified as personal information or personal data under applicable laws; therefore, to the extent that IdeaScale collects IP addresses, IdeaScale will collect, use, maintain, secure and/or disclose IP addresses in accordance with applicable Laws.

  **Communications from the Site**

  **Ongoing Communication and Product Update**

  We will occasionally send you information on product enhancements, new services, and additional instruction on utilizing our services. These communications are designed to educate our users on the services offered. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see 'Choice and Opt-out' in ‘Information Sharing and Disclosure’.

  **Service-related Announcements**

  We will send you strictly service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Service-related emails are also sent confirming billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations.

  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your account.

  **Customer Service**

  Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password as well an account manager contact information. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.

  **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

  **Personally Identifiable Information Sharing with Partners**

  We do not share any personally identifiable information with any third parties except as indicated below.

  If a user specifically requests a service from one of our partnering companies, their personally identifying information will be shared. The partnering company may contact them directly regarding their inquiry. Any requests of partnering companies are initiated solely by the user and it will be clearly indicated that a partnering company offers the requested service.

We use the third party tool LiveChat to host chat support on our site. When you request live chat support, your contact information will be stored by LiveChat as necessary for them to provide that service. LiveChat is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. (LiveChat Privacy Policy: <http://www.livechatinc.com/privacy-policy/>)

  We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

  We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.

  **Choice/Opt-out**

  If you no longer wish to receive our product updates, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each product update email.

  **Web Analytics**

  We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in aggregate form. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

  IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to identify the country of origin of the user. This information is used to facilitate the use of the service and our multi-lingual options.

  **Cookies**

  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and validate that you have logged into your administrative account. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's 'help' file.

  If you reject cookies, the site will not function properly after logging in to your administrative account.

  **Clear Gifs**

  We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see 'Choice and Opt-out' in ‘Information Sharing and Disclosure.’

  **Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

  If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or cancel your account at any time by logging into the system and clicking on the 'My Account' link. Options for updating your profile and account cancellations are available here.

  **Security**

  The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

  **Changes in this Privacy Statement**

  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
