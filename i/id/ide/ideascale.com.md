**1\. GENERAL INFORMATION**  

This privacy policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of information collected through [www.ideascale.com](http://www.ideascale.com/), the IdeaScale services, and related products and services owned and operated by IdeaScale and its subsidiaries (the "Services"). The use of information collected through the Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which IdeaScale customers have engaged IdeaScale. As used in this policy, the term "IdeaScale" collectively refers to IdeaScale, a California corporation, and its subsidiaries. 

IdeaScale strives to conform its privacy practices, policies and/or procedures with any and all applicable international, country specific, U.S. Federal, state and/or local laws, codes, regulations, and requirements and the industry codes, standards and regulations of various market and opinion research professional associations and/or organizations, including without limitation the ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market and Social Research and the Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO). IdeaScale is committed to protecting the security and integrity of all personally identifiable information collected by or disclosed to IdeaScale. This privacy policy identifies the personally identifiable information that IdeaScale collects and how such information will be used and protected. For details regarding additional policies and procedures applied to personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland, please see Section 16 below.

**2\. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**  

IdeaScale provides its web-based Services to support innovation, facilitate dialogue, and to collect ideas and feedback for use by IdeaScale customers. The information you share with IdeaScale, as either an IdeaScale customer or an end user of an IdeaScale customer, is shared, via the internet, with a limited set of IdeaScale end users or the public at large, depending on the community for which you are registered and the preference of the customer that runs that community.

**Registration Information**   
In order to use the Services, you must first complete a registration form and create a username and password. During registration, you are required to give your name and email address. IdeaScale uses this information to contact you about the Services and to provide service-related notices as described in Section 3 below. These communications are used to give you a better understanding of the Services and to support your use of the Services. As always, you have the option not to receive these communications (see Section 5 below). Additionally, an IdeaScale customer may upload email addresses to the Services for the purpose of inviting the address owners to customer's IdeaScale community. IdeaScale will never share any email address, regardless of how it was collected, with any third party without the email address owner's explicit consent.

**Billing Information**   
If you purchase a service from IdeaScale, you must provide your contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). IdeaScale encrypts all credit card information. IdeaScale will use this information to contact you if there are any issues while processing the order. IdeaScale will also use this information to send you service-related communications as described in Section 3 below. These communications include email confirmations of billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations.

**Profile Information**   
IdeaScale stores information that it collects through user input, cookies, log files, and user forms to create a user profile. Depending on your specific use of the Services, a profile may include the following: Registration Information - depending on how IdeaScale customers decide to use the Services, this may include, for example, any of the following: username, password, first name, last name, email address, zip codes, and phone number; and  Preferences - profile selections, such as language preference, that determine the specific way you want IdeaScale Services delivered to you. Details from your profile may be used to contact you to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers about IdeaScale Services and to make service improvements (see Section 3 below). You may update your profile information at any time by clicking on your "Profile" link while logged into your account.

**Interaction Information**    
IdeaScale collects information about you and your use of the Services through tracking technologies such as cookies. See Sections 6 and 7 for full details.

**Information Collected on behalf of IdeaScale Customers**     
IdeaScale collects information under the direction of its customers and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of its customers. IdeaScale may transfer personal information to companies that help it provide the Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements between IdeaScale and its customers. IdeaScale retains personal data it processes on behalf of its customers for as long as needed to provide the Services to its customers. IdeaScale retains this personal information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce its agreements.

**3\. COMMUNICATIONS FROM IDEASCALE**    

**Ongoing Communication and Service Updates**   
IdeaScale occasionally sends its users information on service updates and enhancements, new offerings, and additional instructions on how best to use of the Services. These communications are designed to educate you about the Services. IdeaScale provides you the option not to receive these types of communications; please see Section 5 below for details.

**Service-related Announcements**     
IdeaScale sends service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if a service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, IdeaScale may inform you about the suspension with an email. Service-related emails are also sent to confirm billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, since they are necessary to provide the Services. If you do not want to receive service-related announcements, you have the option to cancel your account.   

**Customer Service**     
At the commencement of your use of the Services, IdeaScale will send you an email to verify your username and password. Throughout your use of the Services, IdeaScale account management and/or support may use your contact information to answer your questions, to respond to service requests, and to provide account management services.

**To Process Credit Card Payments.**  
IdeaScale uses outside credit card processing companies to process your credit card payments. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

**To Provide Requested Partner Services.**   
If you specifically request a service from one of IdeaScale’s partnering companies, your personally identifiable information will be shared with the applicable partnering company. After such a request is made, the partnering company may contact you directly regarding your inquiry. Any service offered by a partnering company will be clearly indicated as a partner's service and not IdeaScale's, and any request must be initiated solely by the user.

**To Provide Requested Materials.**   
If you voluntarily submit your personally identifiable information when requesting informational materials from IdeaScale, this information will be shared with a third-party marketing automations tool, which IdeaScale uses to automate and target its messages to you.

**To Comply with Law.**   
IdeaScale reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when it believes that disclosure is necessary to protect its rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
