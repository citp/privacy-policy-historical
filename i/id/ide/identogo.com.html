This Privacy Statement applies to IDEMIA websites that link to this Privacy Statement. Additional information on our personal information practices may be provided in notices provided at the time of data collection. To the extent a notice provided at the time of collection conflicts with this Privacy Statement, such notice will control.</p><h3>The Collection of Personal Information</h3><p>We may collect information, including personal information, about you as you use our websites and interact with us. "Personal information" is data that reasonably can be used to identify or describe an individual, and may include name, address, email address, phone number, social media account information, or payment card number. You do not need to provide personal information simply to browse our website. If we link other data with your personal information, we will treat that linked data as personal information. We also collect personal information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect personal information to assist us (collectively “Business Partners”).</p><p>IDEMIA collects personal information to operate our business and for other legitimate purposes permitted by applicable law, such as to:
  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Provide products or services you have purchased&nbsp;or requested, including fingerprint-based background checks.&nbsp;</li><li>Provide customer service.&nbsp;</li><li>Improve and personalize your experience on our website.&nbsp;</li><li>Send marketing communications.&nbsp;</li><li>Conduct surveys, marketing promotions, contests or giveaways.&nbsp;</li><li>Manage an application for employment with IDEMIA.</li></ul><p>In some instances, IDEMIA may automatically collect data through cookies, web logs, web beacons and other similar applications. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website and to help tailor content or offers for you. Please read the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/siteassets/legal/privacy_full.html#cookies">"Cookies and Other Web Technologies"</a>&nbsp;section below for more information.</p><h3>Your Choices</h3><p>If you voluntarily provide personal information, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement. If, in connection with your use of a particular service, we ask to use your data in a way not described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit that use, you can choose not to use the particular service.</p><h3>Sharing Your Personal Information</h3><p>IDEMIA keeps your personal information confidential. We
will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Unless we
have your permission, we will not use or share your personal information in
ways unrelated to the ones described at the time you provide the data. IDEMIA engages service providers and suppliers ("Business Partners") to
perform certain functions on MorphTrust's behalf. For example, Business
Partners may provide services to you, maintain IDEMIA information
technology systems, process credit card transactions, provide web hosting
services and assist IDEMIA with marketing and communication initiatives. Business
Partners will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to
perform the services. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the
information received on MorphTrust’s behalf and are prohibited from using it
for any other purpose. Information provided by you to IDEMIA for the
purpose of submitting to a background check will be shared with one or more
government agencies as part of the background check process.</p><p>We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we
believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with applicable law, regulation or
legal process served on Lexmark; (b) comply with
requests for information from police or government authorities; (c) protect and
defend the rights or property of IDEMIA (including the enforcement of our
agreements); or (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety
of IDEMIA employees or members of the public.</p><p>IDEMIA or its affiliates could merge with or be acquired by
another business or their respective assets may be acquired. IDEMIA will
seek appropriate protection for personal information in these types of
transactions.</p><h3>Security of Your Personal Information&nbsp;</h3><p>We protect the personal
information entrusted to us and treat it securely in accordance with this
Privacy Statement and applicable agreements with government agencies.
IDEMIA implements physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to
help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
disclosure. We also require that our suppliers protect such information from
unauthorized access, use and disclosure.&nbsp;</p><h3>Retention of Personal Information&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>We will retain your
personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was
collected. We will retain and use your personal information as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p><h3>Use of Cookies and other Web Technologies&nbsp;</h3><p>Like many websites, IDEMIA uses automatic
data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links and web beacons.
These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our
website, such as your browser type and the address of the website from which
you arrived at our website.
