# Workday Privacy Policy

#### Privacy Policy

##### Privacy Statement

Data Privacy is important to Workday, Inc. (“Workday”). This privacy statement informs visitors of what data Workday gathers on its Web sites, how will use it and with whom we share it. If you have any questions regarding this privacy statement, contact [privacy@workday.com](mailto:privacy@workday.com) or see the “Contact Us” section later in this policy.

This privacy policy describes the information we collect about you as a visitor to our Web sites [www.workday.com](http://www.workday.com/) and [www.peoplearethenewbottomline.com](http://www.peoplearethenewbottomline.com/). The following tells you how we use this information and describes your choices regarding certain types of processing.

##### Information Collected

Workday collects and retains contact information for you as a visitor only if you voluntarily supply us with this information. You may choose to provide us with this information, including your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number or other information, to access protected information on our Web sites or so we can follow up with you after your visit. If you have voluntarily provided this information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this privacy statement. In addition, Workday may combine other publicly available information related to the organization from which you work for with the information that you provide to us. 

Workday does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information collected through its Web sites with third parties for their sole promotional purposes or as otherwise outlined in this policy.

Workday may share information with third parties who resell the Workday service and/or provide value added services such as payroll outsourcing, tax filing, and other administrative services for our Mid-Market Channel offering. Workday’s Mid-Market Channel offering is designed to meet the needs of customers that have fewer than 1,500 employees. When you sign up for webinars, download white papers, or generally inquire about Workday’s offering and/or services, we will share contact information and product interest as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

Workday may disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of Use; or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others.

If Workday goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information collected through our Web site(s) may be among the assets transferred. A prominent notice will appear on our Web site(s) for 30 days after any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

##### Use of Web Site(s)

Workday, or Workday-authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data relating to your use of our Web site(s) and our services. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you or match this information with your other personal information (such as your IP address) unless you have chosen to identify yourself by completing a contact form on the Web site. We may use this collected or logged information to diagnose web site technical problems. Workday or our authorized service provider may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our Web site(s). If you have submitted contact information via forms on a site, Workday may use information from cookies and web beacons to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.

##### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that our Web sites ask to place on your computer's hard drive. If your browser is set to accept cookies, then your browser adds the text in a small file. We do not use cookies to read any other information on your computer's hard drive. We use cookie technology to authenticate your access to various areas of our Web sites, and tailor its content to your preferences. Cookies help us analyze web traffic in general and to track when site visitors complete surveys. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to warn you before a cookie is placed.

We also use web beacons, or transparent GIF files, provided by our service provider to report activity on our site. The beacons help us manage our online advertising and measure its effectiveness. These files enable our service provider to recognize a cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements are most effective. Either Workday or our services providers place the cookie. The information that we collect by means of these technologies is anonymous. It is not personally identifiable unless you have chosen to identify yourself through a form on the Web site.

##### Retargeted Advertising

Retargeted advertising uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is used to display more relevant information to you on the Workday website. This information is also used to display Workday employment opportunities to you if you have visited our careers page. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from Workday or through third party website publishers. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. If you would like to opt out of retargeted advertising from Workday, please [click here](http://preferences.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

##### Customer Data

Workday will not share or distribute any such customer data except as provided in the contractual agreement between Workday and customer, or as may be required by law.
