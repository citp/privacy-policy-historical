In the following we provide you with comprehensive information about the purposes for which and scope within which we process your personal data during the use of the idealo websites.

## 2\. Collection and processing of personal data

You can generally use the idealo websites – for which no payment or registration is required – without providing personal data. In certain cases, we will collect the personal data listed in Section 3. This fundamentally only occurs when necessary for the provision of a functional website or app, or for our content and services. Furthermore, we process personal data in connection with the use of idealo where you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. in the context of registration, a competition, an enquiry sent to us, or because there is another legal basis for this (see Section 4).

## 3\. Categories of data processed

As soon as you visit idealo.co.uk or use one of the apps, our system automatically collects certain technical information. This can include:

  * Information about the browser type and version used

  * Operating system of the device from which the request originates

  * Mobile device ID

  * Date and time of access

  * Web analysis data / pseudonymised user profile (cookie ID, ad ID etc., see below for more information)

  * Websites from which the user got to our website

  * Websites accessed by the user from our website




Furthermore, we process the following personal data where a contractual relationship exists between you and us, or where you have communicated the data to us in another manner:

  * Personal master data (name, address, date of birth)

  * Communication data (telephone number, email address)

  * Contract master data (contractual relationship, product or contract interest, order history)

  * Login data with password

  * Invoicing and payment data

  * Comments, submissions etc.




## 4\. Occasions, reasons for and content of processing: The idealo websites and services in general

We always process your data on the basis of one or more legal permissions or with your consent.

**a. Submission of reviews and comments**

Personal data is collected by idealo when you as a customer submit your review of a product, service, service provider or retailer (hereinafter also referred to as “online shop”), or participate in a survey. In this context, idealo collects the data specified in the respective form and the IP address assigned to the device used by you at the relevant point in time.

Information about you will only be published on the relevant idealo websites when this is indicated in the field of the form. In the case of opinions about online shops, the customer or order number specified by you is also shared with the specific online shop; this is an integral part of our review and comment function, because only then can the online shop be notified of your comments and opinions. We collect and process the data you provide in order to be able to publish your review or comment as desired (Art. 6 para. 1 lpoint b GDPR). In particular, we also require your email address, so we can contact you in the event of complaints and give you the opportunity to respond (Art. 6 para. 1 point c GDPR).

**b. Shopping and direct checkout function**

Based on Art. 6 para. 1 point b) of the GDPR, we additionally collect personal data when you as a customer directly submit a contractual offer for specific products listed on the idealo websites without leaving idealo and being redirected to the websites of the online shops offering these products (the “shopping function” and “direct checkout function”). idealo collects this data in order to initiate the contract and process your order or booking, as well as for the invoicing of the respective online shop for our brokerage service.

idealo transmits this personal data to the respective online shop, where this is required for the conclusion and processing of your contract. If idealo and/or the online shop utilises the services of third parties as service providers for the completion and processing of the contract or the service booked, e.g. for the execution of the booking, the processing of the payment or the shipping of goods (hereinafter referred to as “service providers”), the required data will only be shared with these third parties of the fulfilment and processing of your order. During the process of handling your order or purchase, you will also receive emails to the email address you provided from the respective online shop (e.g. order or purchase confirmation) and, if applicable, from service providers (e.g. payment confirmation or information about the shipping process).

**c. Forms, comparison calculator and payment services for the shopping and direct checkout function:**

Unless otherwise indicated, idealo itself will collect the data you enter in the respective contact forms.

When you enter data in contact forms, we will only use the data for the purpose of conducting the communication with you and/or to provide the service you request; this constitutes our legitimate interest. The processing takes place in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 point B of the GDPR.

idealo sometimes integrates original content from partners for its comparison services and for payment services for the shopping and direct checkout function. In this case, the data that you enter is collected not by us but by the respective partner. The partners are named on the respective idealo websites. The partners have confirmed to us that they will handle your data in compliance with data protection requirements. Nevertheless, idealo has no influence over the collection, processing and use of your data by the partners. For information on whether and to what extent the partners collect your personal data, and what they use it for, please read the privacy policy of the respective partner, which can be accessed from the corresponding idealo website or the content of the partner. In particular, your credit card data will be processed not by idealo, but by a company contracted by us and specialising in card security and forwarded to the payment service provider of the partner.

**d. Emails and Newsletter**

We may use the email address you provided when registering or initiating a buying contract to contact you in relation to goods and services, your purchases and bookings or general information about idealo. The processing of email addresses takes place on the basis of our legitimate interest in advertising our goods and services in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

We will use your email address to send you our newsletter, provided that you have subscribed to it and consented to receiving it, including potential advertisements. In this such cases we will process your email address for the purposes of sending the newsletter as requested (Art. 6 para. 1 point b GDPR). You can object to the use of your email address for such purposes at any time in writing or via email (unsubscribe@idealo.co.uk) effective for the future, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to basic rates.

The content of our newsletters is partly selected based on your prior use of the idealo websites and your expressed interest in products and content. This enables us to tailor the respective newsletter specifically to you and your interests. For example, if you have previously searched for sporting goods on the idealo websites, we would rather present you with sporting goods in our newsletter than other product groups. For this purpose, we also process data that we have collected via our cookies (for more information about these cookies, see paragraph 9 c. below), and link them to your email address. The legal basis for this data processing and the display of content relevant to you is Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR. However you can object to this data processing at any time (see section 16 a).

**e. IP addresses**

On the internet, every device needs a clear address in order to transmit data. This is known as its IP address. It is a technical requirement for the IP address to be saved, at least temporarily, in order to facilitate the delivery of the internet page and app content to the user's device.

a) Log files

For security purposes, our servers save the IP address in so-called log files for 14 days. Reasons for this include being able to determine what happens if an attack (DoS) is made on idealo websites, or if illegal analysis of our databases occurs. This is based on Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

b) Geolocalisation etc.

Before any further or other processing, we shorten the IP addresses, then process them in an anonymised state. Unabbreviated IP addresses are not processed further.

The processing of the (abbreviated) IP addresses allows us to display content with regional relevance on all idealo websites that are accessed from within a certain region. This so-called geolocalisation, or basing the appearance of a website on the location from which it is accessed takes place exclusively on the basis of anonymised IP addresses, and only to a regional level. Under no circumstances can the geographical information obtained, in this manner be used to determine the specific location of a user.

**f. Location information of devices**

If you use the idealo pages on a mobile device or our app, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your device to send such information to the application via the privacy settings on that device. For example, we may use your location to show you hotels and airports nearby. Furthermore, we use the transmitted location information to perform analyzes on the use of our app. You can change the privacy settings of your device at any time to disable the sharing of location information. Please note that disabling location information may affect certain features of our app or mobile website. If you have questions about the privacy settings of your device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your device or your mobile service provider for help.

## 5\. Occasions, reasons for and content of processing: My Favourites and Price Alert

idealo offers you the possibility of creating your own customer account free of charge. To use the "Mein idealo" customer account, you must register with a valid email address and a password. We then use this data to provide you with the customer account, to manage it and to enable its use. This processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 point b GDPR.

When registering for the “Mein idealo” customer account, you consent to idealo using cookies to collect information about your use of idealo and connecting this information to your customer account for the purpose of personalised emails. Usage data is collected and saved whenever you search for or view products, add products to My Favourites, purchase products using the buy or direct booking function or use the Price Alert function. On the basis of your usage behaviour, idealo creates a list of potential interests, which it uses to select content specifically tailored to you and display this content on idealo pages, thus offering you the full range of functions available with the "Mein idealo" customer account. This processing of data and, in particular the linking of data with your account, is based on Art. 6 para. 1 point a GDPR. Furthermore, this data processing and display of content relevant to you constitutes a legitimate interest in connection with Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

Based on this data, we also send you product-related and idealo-related messages that we assume will be of interest to you to the email address associated with your customer account. The aim of these messages is to help you find the products and services that are right for you. Product recommendations and price information is typically included in the product-related emails. In this way, we will send you mails regarding price decreases for products you have searched for or viewed, as well as mails regarding suitable product alternatives or accessories. We will also inform you about price drops for products in My Favourites (see "My Favourites" below) and for products for which you have set a Price Alert (see "Price Alerts" below). idealo-related messages are also sent via email and typically refer to promotions, marketing campaigns and news (e.g. new discounts, voucher codes and competitions). In addition, idealo-related messages serve to provide you with information regarding new features and usage possibilities both for general use of idealo and for use of your idealo customer account.

Alongside the services described above, the "Mein idealo" customer account also offers you the following functions described below:

**a. My Favourites**

You can “save” idealo products and offers on idealo's travel websites (e.g. flights and hotels) by adding them to “My favourites”. You are identified as the owner of your “My Favourites” list by the cookies that are used. The “My Favourites” list allows you to compare products with one another in terms of their specifications and to access the Price Alert function. The “My Favourites” list will be added to by idealo with any products for which you have accessed the checkout screen but not completed the purchase using idealo's “shopping function”. Based on your “My Favourites” list, you will receive product recommendations via email, for example if the prices of the products you have saved change. The legal basis here is Art. 6 para. 1 point b GDPR.

**b. Price Alerts**

You have the option of setting up a Price Alert for products, e.g. if you wish to purchase them for a lower price. You then enter your desired target price for each respective product using the Price Alert function. When you use the Price Alert function, idealo saves your products and target prices together along with your email address, so that we can inform you in the event of price changes. At the same time, a value (“true” or “false”) is saved in the local storage of your browser, which helps us to decide whether to offer you suggestions for Price Alerts in the form of a pop-up. You can find an overview of the saved Price Alerts in your customer account. The legal basis here for processing is also Art. 6 para. 1 point b GDPR.

**c. Order and booking history**

If you use the buy function or the direct booking function, we provide an order or booking history on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 point b GDPR, provided that you were logged in to your “Mein idealo” account at the time of purchase or booking. Your order or booking is linked to the pseudonymous user ID stored by us. In the order history you receive an overview of your completed purchases and bookings, as well as the processing and shipping status of current orders. You also have access to a contact form which you can use to make enquiries about your orders to idealo customer service. When submitting the form, an email with the email address given at the time of purchase will be sent to kundenservice@idealo.de

**d. Account settings**

You can change your password or delete your account in the customer account settings.

## 6\. Location of processing

We ourselves do not transfer your personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), except in cases where it is permitted under the GDPR. Whether third parties, with whom you have your own contractual relationship (such as with Facebook, if you have a Facebook account) transfer data to countries outside of the EEA, is beyond our knowledge and influence.

Some of our contractual partners also process data in countries outside of the EEA. In order to also ensure the protection of your personal rights in the context of these data transfers, we use the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 point c GDPR when drafting contractual relationships with recipients in third countries.

For the US, the European Commission decided on 12th July 2016, that under the regulations of the EU-US Privacy Shields an adequate level of data protection exists (adequacy decision, Art. 45 GDPR). Further information - including the certification of the service providers we use - is available at [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). We only use US service providers who are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.

## 7\. Origin of data

In certain cases, we also receive data because you have consented to it being transmitted to us.

As you know, apps are regularly made available to download via third-party providers (e.g. iTunes, Google etc.). If under the applicable terms and conditions of use of such a provider, idealo internet GmbH becomes your contractual partner for the acquisition of the app, we process the data made available to us by the third-party provider to whatever extent is necessary for the fulfilment of contract, so that you can download the app to your mobile device.

## 8\. Disclosure of your data to third parties

We will only disclose your personal data to third parties where such a transmission is necessary in order to fulfil our legal obligations to you, and where this is visibly done by or together with another provider (e.g. in the case of cooperation agreements), where we are otherwise legally entitled or obliged to disclose the data, or where you have provided us with the relevant consent.

In certain cases, we also use external service providers or affiliated companies, which we have contracted to process data for us in accordance with our instructions. Such service providers are contractually bound by us as data processors in compliance with the strict provisions of the GDPR, and are not permitted to use your data for any further purposes. Data processors used by us perform in particular the following services: data centre, newsletter distribution and web/app analysis.

This disclosure of data to data processors takes place on the basis of Art. 28 para. 1 GDPR, or alternatively on the basis of our legitimate interest in the economic and technical benefits associated with the use of specialised data processors, Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

Where we are legally obliged to do so, or where this is permitted under data protection law, we will disclose personal data to public authorities, e.g. to police or the state prosecutor’s office (Art. 6 para. 1 point c GDPR). The disclosure of this data takes place on the basis of our legitimate interest in combating abuse, the prosecution of crimes, and in safeguarding, asserting and enforcing claims, which are not considered to be outweighed by your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

## 9\. Cookies and other technologies

**a. General**

In order to ensure the full functionality of the idealo websites, idealo and the third parties named below will save files to your device that amongst other things collect information regarding the use of a website or app, as well as additional data such as the IP address of the computer and information about the software being used (see above).

This typically involves the use of so-called cookies. Cookies are small files that your browser saves on your device in a folder created especially for this purpose. These allow it to be determined, for example, whether you have ever visited a website before. If you decide to stay logged into your user account despite leaving the idealo websites, cookies can also be used to save your login data e.g. for the user account, so that you do not need to enter this data every time you access the site.

Many cookies contain unique identifier known as a cookie ID. This code consists of a sequence of characters that allow websites and servers to be mapped to the specific internet browser in which the cookie has been saved. This enables the websites visited to differentiate the individual browser of a specific user from other internet browsers that contain different cookies. This data is not collated with any other data sources.

The use of cookies can also occur in conjunction with so-called web beacons (also called Clear GIFs or tracking pixels). These are small graphics (e.g. in emails and on websites) that are used to achieve a better understanding of how a user interacts with the website.

We use different types of cookies: on the one hand, we use technical cookies, without which the functionality of the idealo websites would be restricted, and on the other hand we use optional (see below) analysis and marketing cookies in order to make our services more user friendly. The analysis cookies are used for the purposes of improving the quality of both our content and yours. They provide us with important information about how idealo is used, allowing us to continuously improve our services. Further information on the individual analysis cookies and services can be found in Section 10 of this privacy policy.

You can prevent us from using cookies at any time by adjusting the corresponding setting in your internet browser, and thus permanently opt out. Furthermore, you can delete existing cookies at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all conventional internet browsers. If you deactivate cookies in the internet browser you use, you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. In addition, you have the opportunity to object to analysis cookies and services (i.e. you can opt out; see Sections 10 and 11).

When using apps, a functionally comparable technology is used instead of cookies.

Cookies cannot identify you personally. In all cases, the use of cookies is justified on the basis of our legitimate interest in terms of a layout meeting user needs, as well as for statistical analysis by idealo and the display of interest-based content (Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR).

**b. Web storage (session storage and local storage)**

idealo utilises web storage technology, a method for saving application data in your browser on your device, provided that your browser supports this technology and you have activated JavaScript. This web storage serves to optimise our internet presence and our services. We use this technology for saving application data during the use of the idealo websites, e.g. in order to make navigation when searching for products or services more convenient, and to provide the “Recently Viewed” function.

Web storage provides two data objects, the session storage and the local storage. The entries in session storage are removed automatically after the browser or app is closed. You can erase the entries in local storage (“Recently Viewed”) at any time by deleting the history in your browser.

The session storage saves information in order to recognise your browser or device from previous visits, and thus provide you with easier access to our services. You can prevent the use of web storage by changing the corresponding setting in your browser, which may restrict the functionality of the idealo websites.

The processing of data in web storage takes place on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 point f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the purposes of processing as described above.

**c. idealo cookies**

Cookies created by idealo allow the collection of information regarding browser type/version, resolution, previous/new display variant, URL clickstream (order of the pages of our website that you have visited previously), time of visit(s) to the websites, the reference in the idealo database for the products/services added to “My Favourites”, and the cookie number, but not personal details such as name, address or email address. We use these cookies for purposes of advertising, market research and when required, for the design of our services in conjunction with user needs. The cookies of idealo are valid for a maximum of two years, unless you delete them sooner. The processing of data is justified in this case by Art. 6 para. 1 point f) GDPR, [however you can object to this processing with effect for the future by clicking here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181214225741id_/https%3A//www.idealo.co.uk/privacypolicy.html?isTrackingOptOut=true). The subsequently set opt-out cookie and your objection remain valid as long as you do not delete your browser cookies.

## 10\. Web/app analysis services, marketing

In order to continuously improve our content and adapt it to the interests of our users, and to display usage-based online advertising, we use a number of services that collect data from our website and the app, and analyse this data for us. Where these service providers are not themselves the data controller with specific regard to data protection legislation, they are always bound by instructions when processing the pseudonymised user data on the basis of a data processing agreement. The legal basis for this processing is always Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

You can deactivate the use of cookies by third-party providers, e.g. by accessing the deactivation page <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> or <http://youronlinechoices.com/> or [http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2〈=EN](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2%E2%8C%A9=EN) and following the instructions provided on opting out.

Not all access to the idealo pages is carried out via a web browser. In cases where users access idealo from a mobile device, disabling cookies or changing web browser settings may not be possible.

In the following, you can find details of the analysis services and marketing partners we use:

**a. Adjust**

We make use of the analysis technology Adjust, operated by adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 36, 10405 Berlin. The Adjust service has been audited and certified under the ePrivacyseal (European Seal for your Privacy) (see <https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/customers/awarded-seals/>). Adjust collects installation and event data, and makes it available in the form of anonymised evaluations and graphics regarding the number of visits, number of pages accessed, or apps opened per user etc. We use this information exclusively for the purposes of our own market research, as well as for the optimisation and design of the website and app in line with user needs. For such an analysis, Adjust uses your anonymised IDFA or Android ID and your anonymised IP and MAC address. It is not possible to identify you personally. You can prevent any corresponding analysis in future at <https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/>.

You can prevent this evaluation taking place in the future by visiting <https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/>.

**b. Ad Up**

Our websites use integrated tracking from Ad Up, a technology and service provider from Axel Springer Teaser Ad GmbH (Axel-Springer-Straße 65, 10969 Berlin). By collecting anonymised and/or pseudonymised data, Ad Up can temporarily display advertising related to your interests on websites.

Ad Up uses cookies in order to offer advertisers so-called conversion tracking, which measures the effectiveness of their advertisements and keywords. More information on data protection at Axel Springer Teaser Ad GmbH can be found at <https://www.adup-tech.com/en/privacy/>.

By using the “Activate opt-out cookie” button at the aforementioned website, you have the option of saving an opt-out cookie to your browser, which will deactivate Ad Up in that particular browser. Furthermore, you can object to this processing of data via Ad Up by clicking here.

**c. AppNexus**

For the display of usage-based advertising, we use AppNexus, a service provider for advertising and operator of a mediation platform (AppNexus, 28 W. 23rd Street, New York, New York, 10010, USA). AppNexus collects and saves Information about your activities, which allows the analysis of user behaviour. The profiles created are used to display targeted, interest-oriented advertising. If you do not want this, you can deactivate the usage-based advertising here <https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy-de> .

If you do not want AppNexus to collect this information, you can deactivate this usage-based advertising here <https://www.appnexus.com/platform-privacy-policy#choices> .

**d. Bing**

This website uses Bing Ads Universal Event Tracking, a conversion tracking service operated by Microsoft (Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA). This service allows us to track the activity of users who accessed our website via a Bing advertisement. This is possible because when you click on a Microsoft Bing Ads advertisement, a cookie (a small text file) is saved on your device. This informs Microsoft and, in particular, idealo about the total number of users that have clicked on an advertisement and reached a predefined target page. This data is saved by Microsoft for 180 days. No personal information about the identity of the user is transmitted. If you do not wish to participate in Universal Event Tracking, you can prevent the saving of cookies, e.g. in your browser settings.

In addition, it is possible to deactivate interest-based advertising from Microsoft by opting out using the following link: [https://account.microsoft.com/languages?lang=en-gb&ru=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fprivacy%2Fad-settings%2Fsignedout%3Flang%3Den-GB](https://account.microsoft.com/languages?lang=en-gb&ru=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fprivacy%2Fad-settings%2Fsignedout%3Flang%3Den-GB)

Alternatively, the following website allows you to reject interest-based advertising from Microsoft as well as other participating companies: <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/>

Further information on the usage and data protection guidelines for this product can be found here: <https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-DE/privacystatement/>

If you do not want your data to be recorded via Bing, please click here.

**e. Crashlytics**

Crashlytics is an analysis tool that is provided and operated by Crashlytics, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139 USA. Crashlytics generates so-called crash reports, which may include reports on glitches and crashes in the app, where and in what context these occurred, how many users of the app have been affected, etc. We use these reports in order to learn from glitches and crashes, react faster, act more precisely and more efficiently with regards to the interests of our users, and make the necessary technical improvements to the app. To this end, Crashlytics records not only your Symphony-related app ID, which you can delete at any time, but also data on the “crash” and general data relating to the respective IT environment (in particular the device used, the mobile provider and the operating system). Where this contains personal or pseudonymised data, this will be deleted by Crashlytics after seven days at most. This information provides Crashlytics with insights into whether the app is working, how it is working and how it is used. In particular, specific information about the glitches and crashes that occur can be gleaned by Crashlytics. Further information is available at <https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf>.

You can implement an opt-out as follows: a) in iOS: select “Settings” > “idealo” > "Data Protection" > and switch off “Send Error Reports”, b) in Android: open the idealo App, go to “Settings” > “Data Protection” and switch off “Send Error Reports”.

**f. Criteo**

Some websites operated by idealo include advertising from third parties, which is provided by Criteo SA, 32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France. This service serves to draw our users’ attention to further content on subject matter closely related to the content already viewed by the respective user. The content and technical aspects of the advertisements displayed are controlled and delivered solely by Criteo. Where the user has not opted out (see below), the selection of advertising displayed will be based on the content that the user is currently viewing and has recently viewed on the respective website. According to its own statements, Criteo only collects anonymised data.

idealo likewise uses Criteo to publish advertising on the websites of third parties and in emails from third parties (<https://emailprivacy.criteo.com/de/index.html>) in order to address previous customers of idealo. In this process, the identity of the customer is not identified, and the customer is only recognised in pseudonymised form. This takes place using various devices of the customer, using an encrypted (undecryptable) email address. The cookies are stored for 180 days. Further information: <https://support.criteo.com/hc/en-us/articles/202427141-Cross-Device-Integration>

Criteo, as the data controller, provides information about the collection and utilisation of usage data and other data in its own privacy policy <https://www.criteo.com/privacy/>. The privacy policy also gives you the option of objecting to the use of usage data and other data for certain purposes (your preference - “Opt out”). Advertising will then no longer be controlled based on the usage data collected by Criteo.

You can object to this processing with effect for the future by clicking here.

**g. DCMN TV Tracking**

In order to measure the success of our television advertising campaigns, we use tracking pixels on our webpages that are provided by DCMN GmbH, Boxhagener Str. 18, 10245 Berlin. These tracking pixels help us to better understand the effect of such advertising campaigns.

You can object to this processing of data via the DCMN Tracking Pixel by clicking here.

**h. Exact Target (measuring Newsletter success, conversion tracking)**

idealo utilises the ExactTarget email service operated by salesforce.com, inc., Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, 94105, USA. (“ExactTarget”). Where users have consented to receive emails from idealo and visit the website via these emails, cookies and web beacons will be used in order to track the success of the newsletters, e.g. whether it was opened and which topic was particularly relevant.

Web beacons (also known as ClearGIFs or tracking pixels) are small graphics (e.g. in emails and on websites, that are used to achieve a better understanding of how a user interacts with the website. Web beacons function on the website together with cookies. Users can therefore stop the use of web beacons by preventing the installation of the cookies through the corresponding browser settings. If users do not wish to receive emails with web beacons, they can also switch emails into text format instead of HTML format.

You can object to this processing of data with effect for the future by clicking here. This objection will be saved in a cookie.

**i. ExactTarget (adjustment for users)**

idealo uses the service “Predictive Intelligence” from ExactTarget in order to track the success of emails, websites and apps from idealo, and to optimise these for the users. Personal data is not transmitted to ExactTarget; instead only pseudonyms are created.

**j. Facebook Conversion Pixel**

We use the “Conversion Pixel” or Visitor Activity Pixel of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). By accessing this pixel from your browser, Facebook can subsequently recognise whether a Facebook advertisement was successful, e.g. whether it resulted in the conclusion of an online purchase. In relation to this we receive exclusively statistical data from Facebook without reference to any specific person. This allows us to record the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes. In particular if you are signed into Facebook, we refer you to their privacy policy <https://en-gb.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

You can object to this processing of data via the Facebook Conversion Pixel with effect for the future by clicking here.

**k. Facebook Website Custom Audiences**

Within our website, we use the “Website Custom Audiences” pixel operated by the social network Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. This involves so-called tracking pixels being integrated into our websites. When you visit our websites, the tracking pixel allows a direct connection to be created between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook receives from your browser, amongst other things, the information that our website was accessed from your device. If you are a Facebook user, Facebook can thus collate the visit to our websites with your user account. Please note that as the provider of the websites, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted, or of how this data is used by Facebook. We are only able to select targeted groups of Facebook users (specific ages, interests etc) to whom our advertising should be shown. In the process, we use one of two functions of Custom Audiences, whereby no data sets, and in particular no email addresses of our users - neither encrypted nor unencrypted - are transmitted to Facebook. Further information about this can be found in the privacy policy of Facebook at <https://en-gb.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

Please click here if you do not wish data to be collected via Custom Audiences.

**l. Google Products**

a) Google AdSense

We have integrated Google AdSense on this website. Google AdSense is an online service that allows the mediation of advertising on third-party websites. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements for third-party websites based on the content of the respective third-party website. Google AdSense permits interest-oriented targeting of internet users, which is implemented by generating individual user profiles.

The operating company of the Google AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

The purpose of the Google AdSense component is the integration of advertisements into our website. Google AdSense saves a cookie to your browser. The definition of cookies is available above. Saving the cookie allows Alphabet Inc. to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which we operate and on which a Google AdSense component has been integrated, is visited, the internet browser on your device is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component to send data to Alphabet Inc. for the purposes of online advertising and the invoicing of commissions. Within the framework of this technical process, Alphabet Inc. receives knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which is used by Alphabet Inc., amongst other things, to determine the origin of the visitor and the clicks, and subsequently to facilitate commission invoicing.

You can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opt out.

Activating this setting in the internet browser would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from saving a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Furthermore, you can delete any cookie saved by Alphabet Inc. at any time using your internet browser or other software programs.

Google AdSense additionally uses so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded into websites in order to allow log file recording and log file analysis, which allows a statistical analysis to be performed. This embedded tracking pixel means Alphabet Inc. can recognise when a website was opened by a data subject, and the links that the data subject clicked. Tracking pixels are used, amongst other things, to analyse the visitor traffic of a website.

Google AdSense sends personal data and information, including the IP address, which is necessary for the creation and invoicing of the displayed adverts, to Alphabet Inc. in the USA, where it is saved and processed. Under certain circumstances, Alphabet Inc. may disclose the personal data collected using this technical process to third parties.

Google AdSense is explained in greater detail at this link <https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/adsense/start/#/?modal_active=none> and <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=de>. More information and options for the deactivation of this advertising placement can be found at <https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en>.

b) Google AdWords

We have integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an online advertising service that allows advertisers to place advertisements both in the search results of Google and in Google’s advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to predefine certain keywords, by means of which an advertisement is displayed in the search results of Google exclusively when the user of the search engine accesses search results related to the keyword. In the Google advertising network, the advertisements are distributed to thematically relevant websites using an automated algorithm with reference to the predefined keywords. The operating company of the services of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The purpose of Google AdWords is to promote our website by displaying interest-based advertising on the websites of third-party companies and in the search results of the Google search engine, as well as displaying third-party advertising on our website. If you come to our website via a Google advertisement, Google saves a so-called conversion cookie to the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is available above. A conversion cookie becomes invalid after thirty days and is not used to identify the data subject. Until the conversion cookie expires, it is used to determine whether certain sub-pages, for example the shopping basket of an online shop system, are accessed on our website. The conversion cookie allows both us and Google to track whether a data subject that comes to our website via an AdWords advertisement generates sales, i.e. whether a purchase has been completed or aborted.

The data and information collected by the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website. In turn, these are used by us to determine the total number of users that have accessed idealo via AdWords advertisements, and thus to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords advertisements, and to optimise these for the future. Neither our company nor any other advertising customers from Google AdWords receive information from Google that could allow the data subject to be identified.

The conversion cookie saves personal information, for example the websites visited by the data subject. For each visit to our websites, personal data is sent to Google in the USA, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject. This personal data is saved by Google in the USA. Under certain circumstances, Google may disclose the personal data collected using this technical process to third parties.

The data subject can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opt out. Activating this setting in the internet browser in use would also prevent Google from saving a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Furthermore, you can delete any cookie saved by Google AdWords at any time using your internet browser or other software programs.

The data subject also has the option of withdrawing consent for the display of interest-based advertising from Google. To do this, the data subject should access the link <https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en> and change the desired settings in each internet browser that they use.

Further information and the applicable privacy policy of Google can be accessed at <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB>.

You can also deactivate or opt out of Google advertisements <https://privacy.google.com/?hl=gb#google-experience> wholly or in part.

You can also object to this processing of data by AdWords with effect for the future by clicking here.

c) Google Analytics

We have integrated Google Analytics (with anonymisation function). Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the recording, collection and evaluation of data regarding the behaviour of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects data, amongst other things, about the websites from which a data subject arrived at another website (known as the referrer), which sub-pages of the website were accessed, or how often and for how long a sub-page was viewed. A web analysis is predominantly used for optimisation of a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of online advertising.

The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

For the web analysis via Google Analytics we use the suffix "_gat._anonymizeIp". This suffix means that the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject is abbreviated and anonymised by Google if the access to our websites originates in a Member State of the European Union or from another signatory state to the Treaty on the European Economic Area.

The purpose of the Google Analytics component is the analysis of visitor traffic on our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, amongst other things, to analyse the use of our website, in order to compile online reports for us which identify the activities on our websites, and in order to provide additional services relating to the use of our website.

Google Analytics saves a cookie to the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies can be found above. Saving the cookie allows Google to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which we operate and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, is visited, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to send data to Google for the purposes of online analysis. Within the framework of this technical process, Google receives knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which is used by Google, amongst other things, to determine the origin of the visitor and the clicks, and subsequently to facilitate commission invoicing.

Further information and the applicable privacy policy of Google can be accessed at [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&gl=de](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&gl=de) and <https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html>. Google Analytics is explained in greater detail at this link <https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/#?modal_active=none>.

We use the Google Analytics feature “Demographic and Interests Reporting”. In order to compile these statistical reports, Google makes use of data that Google has collected in connection with interest-based advertising and visitor data (e.g. age, gender and interests) from third-party providers. idealo cannot associate this data with a specific person or a specific user ID, but Google may be able to do so. You can opt out of data collection by Google by turning Google “ad personalisation” off at the following link: <https://www.google.de/settings/ads>.

We also use the Google Analytics feature “Google Signals”. This feature provides aggregated reports on cross-device user counts as well as different groups of users based on the different device combinations they use. This information is not associated for us with a specific person or a specific user ID. However, in order to compile these reports, Google uses the data of its users who have the “ad personalisation” option turned on in their Google account settings. For this reason, we assume that Google can associate the data with specific users who have Google accounts. You can opt out of the collection of data via Google Signals by turning Google “ad personalisation” off in your Google account: <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en>.

You can also object to this processing of data via Google Analytics with effect for the future by clicking here.

d) Google DoubleClick

We have integrated components of DoubleClick by Google on this website. DoubleClick is a brand owned by Google, under which predominantly online marketing solutions are marketed to advertising agencies and publishers.

The operating company of DoubleClick by Google is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

DoubleClick by Google transmits data to the DoubleClick server with every page impression, as well as with clicks or other activities. Each of these data transfers triggers a cookie request to the browser of the data subject. If the browser accepts this request, DoubleClick saves a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies can be found above. The purpose of the cookies is to optimise and display advertising. The cookie is used, amongst other things, to identify and display advertising that is relevant to the user, and to prepare reports about advertising campaigns and improve such campaigns. The cookie is also used to prevent multiple versions of the same advertisement being displayed.

DoubleClick uses a cookie ID which is necessary for the handling of the technical process. The cookie ID is required, for example, to display an advertisement in a browser. DoubleClick can additionally use the cookie ID to record which advertisements have already been displayed in a browser in order to avoid displaying duplicates. The cookie ID also enables DoubleClick to record conversions. Conversions are recorded, for example, when a user was previously shown a DoubleClick advertisement, and then subsequently uses the same internet browser to complete a purchase on the website of the advertiser.

A cookie from DoubleClick contains no personal data. A DoubleClick cookie can, however, contain additional campaign IDs. A campaign ID serves to identify the campaigns with which the user has already been in contact.

Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which we operate and on which a DoubleClick component has been integrated, is visited, your internet browser is automatically prompted by the respective DoubleClick component to send data to Google for the purposes of online advertising and the invoicing of commissions. Within the framework of the technical process, Google receives knowledge of data that Google also uses for the creation of commission invoices. Google can determine, amongst other things, that the data subject has clicked certain links on our website.

You can prevent cookies from being used by our website at any time, as already described above, by adjusting the corresponding setting in the internet browser used, and thus permanently opting out. Activating this setting in the internet browser would also prevent Google from saving a cookie on your information technology system. Furthermore, cookies already saved by Google can be deleted at any time using your internet browser or other software programs. Detailed information on opting out of cookies can be found here: <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-GB>.

You can deactivate the display of personalised advertising at the following link: <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=gb>.

Further information and the applicable privacy policy of DoubleClick by Google can be accessed at <https://policies.google.com/?hl=en-GB>.

e) Google Dynamic Remarketing

On the website, we use the remarketing or “similar audiences” function of Google Inc. (“Google”), operated by Google Remarketing is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. This function allows the provider to target visitors to the website individually, by displaying interest-based advertisements that are personalised for the visitors to the provider’s website if they have visited other websites in the Google Display network. Google uses so-called cookies to perform the analysis of the website use, which forms the basis for creating personalised, interest-based advertisements. To this end, Google saves a small file with a series of numbers in the browsers of visitors to the website. This number is used to record visits to the website and anonymised data about the use of the website. The personal data of visitors to the website is not saved. If you subsequently visit another website in the Google Display network, you will be shown advertisements that have a greater probability of including products and product groups that you have already viewed.

You can permanently deactivate the use of cookies specifically by Google by using the following link and then downloading and installing the plug-in: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin>.

You also have the option at any time of opting out of Google's interest-based advertising. To do this, you should access the link <https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en> and change the desired settings in each internet browser that you use.

Alternatively, you can deactivate the use of cookies by third-party providers by accessing the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> and following the information provided there on opting out.

Further information on Google Remarketing and the privacy policy of Google can be viewed at: <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-GB>.

f) Google Firebase

We use Firebase, operated by Google Inc., 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, in conjunction with our apps. This is a real-time database that allows real-time information to be embedded in one’s own website, in order to better understand user behaviour in the apps with a view to app optimisation. Furthermore, other functions of Firebase are also used that allow better user navigation or evaluation of what causes crashes in the apps. Firebase is a Google subsidiary and is based in San Francisco (CA), USA. Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Firebase at <https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html>.

You can implement an opt-out as follows: a) in iOS: please select “Settings” > "idealo" > "Data Protection" > and switch off “Send User Data”, b) in Android: open the idealo App, select “Settings” > “Data Protection” and switch off “Send User Data”.

g) Google Tag Manager

idealo uses the Tag Manager from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Tags are the IDs of data elements. Tracking pixels from the third-party providers named here are loaded on the websites. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain and does not record personal data. The tool ensures that other tags are triggered, which in turn may record data. However, Google Tag Manager does not access this data. Further information is available here: <https://www.google.com/intl/en-uk/tagmanager/use-policy.html> and [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&gl=de](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&gl=de).

**m. Hotjar**

idealo uses the analysis software “Hotjar” operated by Hotjar Ltd, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta, to measure and evaluate user behaviour (mouse movements, clicks, scrolling position, etc.) on our websites. By using Hotjar technology, we can gain a better understanding of our users’ experiences, allowing us to adapt our website based on user feedback. For this purpose, Hotjar saves cookies on the user’s devices to record non-personal user data, such as browser information, operating system, time spent on the website, etc. (only with an anonymised IP address). Hotjar saves this information in a pseudonymised user profile. This information is used neither by Hotjar nor by us to identify individual users or combined with other data about individual users. More information can be found in Hotjar’s privacy policy here. Please click here for further information: <https://www.hotjar.com/privacy> and here to find out how to deactivate this function: <https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out>.

**n. Ingenious Technologies**

For some offers on idealo, a cookie from Ingenious Technologies AG, Französische Straße 48, 10117 Berlin, is activated when the link to an online shop’s offer is clicked. These cookies are used to subsequently assign online shop sales to the respective offer on idealo and to invoice the online shop in question. Art. 6 para. 1 point b GDPR serves as the legal basis for using these cookies; in any case, idealo has a legitimate interest in tracking for the purposes of invoicing and reporting. Should you wish to opt out of this tracking, you can prevent it by activating the “Do Not Track” function in your browser.

**o. Outbrain**

We use the services of London-based Outbrain UK Limited (175 High Holborn, London WC1V 7AA, UK). Outbrain UK Limited uses cookies to collect and process information about which websites your browser has visited, which advertising space has been clicked, how long a website has been visited, and about the general interaction with the website. In addition, Outbrain UK Limited collects information about the attractiveness of online advertising, such as the number of clicks and the resulting online sales that an advertisement generates. As a result, we can adapt the displayed online advertising to be more relevant to you.

You can also object to this processing of data from Outbrain with effect for the future by clicking here.

**p. Spoteffects/Matomo**

We measure the interaction with our website in correlation to advertisements aired on television in cooperation with the service provider spoteffects, webeffects GmbH, Knorrstraße 69, 80807 Munich, Germany (“spoteffects”). A contract exists between idealo and spoteffects for the purpose of data processing. To fulfil this purpose, spoteffects relies on the results that we generate using the analysis tool “Matomo”. Matomo is an open-source web analysis tool (more information at: [http://matomo.org](http://matomo.org/)). The information gathered on website usage via the cookie are saved on spoteffects’ servers in Germany. The IP address is anonymised immediately after it is processed. Users can object to the recording of data at:

[http://trck.spoteffects.net/analytics/index_siteid452.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en](http://trck.spoteffects.net/analytics/index_siteid452.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en) (for flights.idealo) and [http://trck.spoteffects.net/analytics/index_siteid300.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en](http://trck.spoteffects.net/analytics/index_siteid300.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en) (for hotel.idealo).

**q. Remerge Retargeting**

idealo uses the retargeting (remarketing) function of remerge GmbH (“remerge”). This function allows us to address users who have visited our app with personalised advertising when they visit the sites or offers of third-parties at a later point in time. For this purpose, information based on user behaviour, e.g. which app content users have viewed or which advertisement they have clicked on, is stored in pseudonymised form. These pseudonymised usage profiles are never combined with users’ personal data and are only used to facilitate interest-based advertising. Users, who do not wish for remerge’s retargeting (remarketing) function to be used, can deactivate it by following the instructions provided for an “Opt-out” at: <https://www.remerge.io/privacy-policy.html>.

Alternatively, you can implement an opt-out as follows: a) in iOS select “Settings” > “idealo” > “Data Protection”, and switch off “Send Campaign Data”, b) in Android: open the idealo App, select “Settings” > “Data Protection” and switch off “Send Campaign Data”.

**r. SiteSpect**

We use SiteSpect (SiteSpect Inc., 10 Milk Street, Suite 820, Boston, MA 02108, USA) to test user behaviour on various versions of our website. SiteSpect saves a cookie to the data subject’s information technology system in order to analyse user behaviour. The definition of cookies can be found above. If you do not want to participate in improving idealo through A/B tests conducted by SiteSpect, you can, for example, reject the saving of cookies in your browser settings in order to opt out of these A/B tests. In addition, you have the option to object via this link.

**s. Scalable central measurement next generation (audience measurement)**

The website uses the measurement procedure (“SZMnG”) of INFOnline GmbH, Brühler Str. 9, 53119 Bonn, to determine statistical characteristics about the use of this website. The purpose of the audience measurement is to determine statistically the usage intensity, the number of users of a website and the surfing behaviour – on the basis of a standardised procedure – and thus to obtain comparable values across the market.

INFOnline GmbH collects and processes data in accordance with German data protection laws. Technical and organisational measures are implemented to ensure that individual users cannot be identified at any point in time. Data that can be associated with a particular, identifiable person is anonymised as soon as possible.

The IP addresses are abbreviated before any data is processed. Data is only ever processed in anonymous form. Unabbreviated IP addresses are not stored or processed further. This is known as geolocalisation, i.e. assigning an instance of website access to the location from which it is accessed, and takes place exclusively on the basis of anonymised IP addresses, and only to a regional level. Based on the geographical information thus obtained, it is never possible to draw conclusions about a user’s exact location.

To recognise computer systems, audience measurement also uses either a cookie with the identifier “ioam.de”, a “local storage object” or an anonymous signature, which is created based on different information automatically transmitted by your browser. The cookie is only valid for a period of up to one year. To measure distributed usage (i.e. the use of a service from different devices), the user ID can be transmitted to INFOnline when the user logs in, provided that it is available as an anonymised checksum.

The stored data on usage events (visits) will be erased after seven months at the very latest.

Further information about data protection in regards to measuring methods is available on the website of INFOnline GmbH (<https://www.infonline.de/en/>), which carries out the measurement procedure, on the data protection website of AGOF (<http://www.agof.de/datenschutz-allgemein/?lang=en>) and the data protection website of IVW (<http://www.ivw.eu/englische-version>).

Should you not wish to participate in the measurement, you can opt out by clicking the following link: [https://optout.ioam.de](https://optout.ioam.de/)

**t. Tealium Audience Stream**

Our website uses the service “Tealium Audience Stream”, which is operated by Tealium Inc., 11085 Torreyana Road, San Diego, CA 92121, USA (Tealium), to collect and store data, which is used to create pseudonymised usage profiles. On behalf of this website’s operator, Tealium uses these profiles to automate and design your website usage to meet your needs in real time and to display advertising. The following information, for example, is collected for this purpose: viewed and clicked adverts, articles, visitor numbers, site topics, etc.

The pseudonymised usage profiles are not combined with personal data about the pseudonymised data subject without consent being explicitly granted for this. The IP address transmitted by your browser will also not be merged with the usage profiles.

Cookies are used to create usage profiles or to activate similar technologies on mobile devices. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is stored exclusively in Germany. You can prevent cookies from being saved by activating the corresponding setting in your browser software. However, deactivating cookies may result in limited functioning of certain parts of this website.

You can object to data being collected and stored for web analysis and advertising purposes at any time with effect for the future by following the instructions provided here: <http://tealium.com/de/privacy/>.

**u. Tealium Tag Management System**

This website uses the Tag Management System (TMS) service operated by Tealium Inc., 11085 Torreyana Road, San Diego, CA 92121, USA (Tealium), in order to dynamically adapt sections of the website. A cookie named utag_main is created in order to enable this functionality. TMS is required to provide the service and therefore cannot be deactivated.

**v. Travel Audience**

This website uses the tracking pixel provided by Travel Audience GmbH, Elsenstraße 106, 12435 Berlin (“Travel Audience”), in order to display contextual adverts and better understand user interaction with these adverts and thus measure the impact that such adverts have on our website. For this purpose, cookies from Travel Audience are saved in your browser. More information can be found at <https://travelaudience.com/website-privacy-policy/>. You can withdraw consent to this collection of data by Travel Audience at any time with effect for the future. More information about preventing cookies being saved can be found in the help menu of your browser.

**w. Twitter Remarketing (contact with idealo users)**

This website uses Twitter’s remarketing feature (Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA) to enable idealo to address users with advertising on Twitter that is based on their interests. For this purpose, Twitter uses so-called “tags”. These tags are used to record data on website visits and website usage. When a user visits a website containing such a tag, Twitter saves a cookie in the user’s browser. This cookie’s unique ID is recorded, and it is included in the target audience for remarketing on Twitter. Twitter users can deactivate this function by following the instructions provided here: <https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171528>.

You can also object to this processing of data via Twitter with effect for the future by clicking here.

**x. Marketing networks (contact with idealo users)**

We work with the following affiliate marketing partners for the purpose of marketing our pages. Affiliate marketing is an internet-based form of referred business which enables the commercial operators of websites, so-called merchants or advertisers, to place adverts on the websites of third parties, marketing partners or so-called affiliates or publishers, usually on a commission per click or commission per sale basis. The merchant provides a form of advertising, such as a banner or another suitable means of internet advertising, via the affiliate network, which is then incorporated by an affiliate into its own website or advertised via other channels such as keyword advertising or email marketing.

For the purposes of measuring success and invoicing between the merchant and the affiliate for purchases or bookings made via the affiliate network, so-called cookies and conversion pixels from the respective affiliate partner are saved. These tracking cookies at no point store any personal data. The only data that is stored is the identification number of the affiliate who is forwarding a potential customer on to the merchant, as well as the order number of the website user and the advert on which the website user clicked. The legal basis for this data collection and storage is our interest in the marketing of idealo pages in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR.

You can prevent the use of cookies at any time by adjusting the corresponding settings in your internet browser and thus permanently opt out of the storage of cookies. Activating this setting in the internet browser in use would also prevent the affiliate network from saving a cookie in your browser. Furthermore, you can delete all cookies that have previously been set by the affiliate network at any time via your internet browser or another software program. Components of the following affiliate marketing networks are integrated into idealo pages:

If you do not agree to this, we request that you do not use the chat and do not enter any personal data into it. You may object to the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser software.

## 11\. Social networks

You can also find us on the social networks of foreign companies, e.g. Facebook or Twitter, and we have partially integrated functions of these networks into our online services. In both cases, you must be registered and logged into the respective social network to use it. A social network is a place for social meetings on the internet, an online community which generally allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and experiences, or enable the internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Please note that when using the respective social network, this company’s terms of use and data protection conditions, over which we have no control, apply. We would like to explain to you how such networks process your personal data in this context:

Each time one of the individual pages of this website, on which a social network component (Facebook plug-in, Google+ plug-in, LinkedIn plug-in, Pinterest plug-in, Twitter plug-in, YouTube plug-in) has been integrated, your internet browser is automatically prompted by the respective component of the social network to download a display of the corresponding component. Further information about the technical integration of each respective network can be accessed at the following links: Facebook: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=en_US>, Google +: <https://developers.google.com/+/>, LinkdeIn: <https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins>, Pinterest <https://developers.pinterest.com/>, Twitter: <https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons>, Xing: <https://dev.xing.com/>, Youtube: <https://developers.google.com/youtube/>. Within the scope of this technical process, the respective network receives concrete information about which subpages of our website you have visited.

Every time you access our website and are simultaneously logged into a social network, the social network in question detects which specific subpage of our webpage you have visited for the entire duration of each respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the respective component of the social network and associated with your account on the network. If you click on one of the social network buttons integrated on our website, post a comment or make a recommendation, the social network then assigns this data and information to the personal user account of the social network and stores the personal data. Google, for example, connects this personal data with other Google services, citing an optimisation of their services as the reason for doing so.

The network is sent information via the respective network component that you have visited our website, provided that you are logged into the network at the time our website is accessed; this occurs regardless of whether you click the component or not. If you do not wish for this information to be transmitted to the respective social network, then you can prevent this transmission by logging out of your respective social network account before accessing our website. However, the social network also records your page views regardless of whether you are logged into the social network when you visit idealo pages.

## 12\. Payment providers

Should you use a paid service or purchase something via our website/app, we offer a variety of different payment methods. If you decide to use one of these payment service providers, you will leave our site. This payment service provider then collects and processes all data. No personal data, in particular no bank or credit card data, is disclosed to us. We are only informed about successful payment transactions. The following payment service providers are available:

**a. PayPal**

We have integrated the PayPal payment method on this website. PayPal is an online payment service provider of PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed using an email address, so there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to prompt online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also acts as trustee and offers buyer protection services. If the data subject selects “PayPal” as the payment option during the ordering process in the online shop, the data subject's data is automatically transmitted to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the transmission of personal data required for payment processing. The personal data transmitted to PayPal typically includes the first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number or any other data necessary for payment processing. Concluding the purchase contract also requires personal data related to the respective order. The purpose of transmitting data is to process the payment and prevent fraud. In particular, we shall transmit personal data to PayPal if a legitimate interest in the transmission exists. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and us shall be transmitted by PayPal to credit reporting agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks. PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliated companies and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfil contractual obligations or if the data is to be processed on behalf of PayPal. The data subject can revoke at any time his/her consent from PayPal to handle personal data. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted for the (contractual) processing of payments.

If the data subject selects “Sofortüberweisung” as the payment option in our online shop during the ordering process, the data subject’s data shall automatically be transmitted to Sofortüberweisung.

The online merchant is then automatically informed that the financial transaction has been carried out. The personal data exchanged with Sofortüberweisung typically includes the first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number or any other data required for payment processing. The purpose of transmitting data is to process the payment and prevent fraud. We shall also transmit other personal data to Sofortüberweisung if a legitimate interest in the transmission exists.

The other information is only required so that we may contact you in connection with your use of Disqus, if, for instance, we have queries about your user comments or to avoid liability and misuse. In order not to be liable for the contents of comments, it may be necessary for us to erase comments, exclude them from publication or, as a more lenient measure, edit them with appropriate labelling.

The terms of use and data protection guidelines from Disqus, which are available at <http://docs.disqus.com/help/30/> and <http://docs.disqus.com/help/29/>, apply to the collection, processing and use of data by Disqus and to your rights in this regard.

## 14\. Retention period

We only store personal data as long as we are legally entitled to do so and as long as the purpose for processing data is still valid. Data will then be erased after a short period of time.

In addition to information regarding the retention period of certain data elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we inform you of the following:

  * If you have a customer account (see above for more information), your orders and purchases will be stored on your account until it is deleted. Any transactions that were made more than four years prior to the account being deleted will be deleted immediately; more recent transactions are deleted on a rolling basis when four years have passed since the purchase or booking was made. If you use the buy or direct booking function as a guest, the data collected during the process is deleted four years after the purchase or booking. Any other data associated with the customer account will be stored until you delete your account or until you have not logged into your account for more than 13 months.

  * Data shall only be processed based on your consent and the data shall only be stored until you revoke your consent.

  * The exact retention period of a cookie can be found in the respective cookie by displaying this cookie in your browser.

  * Applicable laws also provide for certain minimum retention periods. The German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Fiscal Code (AO) call for business letters to be retained for a period of (at least) six years; “business letters” also include emails which we exchange with you. The German Fiscal Code (AO) also requires a range of other data to be stored for at least ten years.




It is, however, not always possible for us to specify the exact retention period for all data or categories of data. In regards to the retention period, we strictly adhere to the law. If, for example, it is still possible to make claims in regards to a contract, we retain the corresponding data and, when Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR is applied, your interests and/or basic rights and fundamental freedoms limit the retention period to be implemented and play a significant role in determining it once the requirements of the law are taken into consideration.
