# idealo internet GmbH privacy policy

A confidential treatment of the personal data of our users is very important to us. In this privacy policy we explain which data we collect, process and store when you use our websites and the services offered therein.

This website is the property of idealo internet GmbH, Ritterstraße 11, 10969 Berlin, Germany (hereinafter referred to as "idealo").

On request, idealo will inform you in writing about any personal data relating to your person that has been saved by idealo. Your legal rights to amend, block or delete this data will be upheld. You may at any time withdraw consent for your personal data being saved with future effect without incurring any additional costs other than those incurred by sending us this withdrawal of consent. Notification in written form sent to privacy@idealo.co.uk or the postal address mentioned above is sufficient to effect this withdrawal of consent.

Any further questions regarding your personal data or this privacy policy can be addressed by writing to privacy@idealo.co.uk.

When you visit idealo's websites, no personal data is collected or used except in the cases outlined below. By using our websites, you confirm that you are of legal age and capacity to contract.

## Reviews

idealo collects personal data when you submit a user review or rating for a product, service or retailer (hereinafter also referred to as “online shop”). In such a case, idealo collects the data entered on the review form, as well as your IP address (as far as this is considered personal data). Data is published on the websites only if it is entered in form fields marked for this purpose. When an online shop review is entered, the customer or order number will be shared with the online shop. If you do not wish the online shop to receive this information, then you cannot submit an online shop review.

## Buying Function

idealo also collects personal data when you, as a customer, submit a purchasing contract for certain products or services listed on our websites without being redirected to the websites of the online shop (so-called buying function). This data is collected to initiate and process the contract and to create an invoice for the product or service rendered on behalf of the online shop in question. idealo then sends this personal data to the respective shop, insofar as this is required to initiate and process the purchasing contract. If idealo and/or the online shop makes use of a third party for the purpose of processing or concluding this contract (e.g. for shipping purposes or payment handling), only the personal data that is required to process and complete the order shall be passed on to the third party.

## Forms, Comparison Services and Payment for the Buying Function

In parts of its travel comparison sites and its payment services, idealo includes original content from its price comparison partners. In such cases, data may be collected not by idealo, but by the relevant partner who will be mentioned on the respective idealo websites. These partners have agreed with idealo to use your data only in a manner that conforms to idealo's privacy policy. idealo, however, has no influence on the way these partners collect, process and use your data. For more information about how these partners collect your personal data and for what purposes, please read the privacy policy of the relevant partner. These can be accessed via the relevant idealo websites and the content provided by the partner.

Unless otherwise stated, idealo itself collects data you enter into contact forms. idealo makes it clear that under certain circumstances, data is transferred over an unsecured Internet connection and could be accessed or corrupted by unauthorised third parties. Please be aware that any information you make public (e.g. in forums or as comments), could be collected and used by others. The contents of any contributions you make (in particular your comments and forum contributions) remain accessible even if they are anonymous or pseudonymous as a result of the removal of the user name.

## idealo Log-In

The idealo Log-In provides you with a centralised location where you can access all of idealo's services. Registration for idealo Log-In always requires you to enter a valid email address and password. Should you use your idealo Log-In profile to access other services provided, these may require you to enter additional personal information before they can be made available to you. In such cases, you will be informed of this requirement prior to accessing the service.

## Price Alert, Newsletter and idealo Bargains Mail (hereinafter jointly referred to as “Mailings”)

Our Mailings inform you regularly via email about the current price trends and interesting offers from idealo's product and service comparison. Registration is voluntary. By registering, you agree to the processing of the data you entered for the purpose of receiving emails. In addition, you permit idealo to collect and process data about your usage patterns (i.e., the opening and clicking of links in the email) for the purpose of optimising the contents and offers in the Mailings according to your needs. For example, if you click links on the subject x several times, but not on the subject y, then in future Newsletters you will receive more links on the subject x. You can withdraw permission at any time without explanation effective thereafter by sending an email to unsubscribe@idealo.co.uk.

## User Surveys

All survey results will be anonymous and will be processed and used solely by idealo. You can withdraw consent for this use of data at any time, as detailed at the start of this privacy policy.

## Cookies and IP Addresses (without personal references)

To ensure the complete functionality of the websites, idealo or third parties listed below save cookies on the customer's device. The online shops that are listed with idealo may also use cookies once you have accessed their websites. More information can be found on the respective shops' websites.

A cookie is a small text file that collects information about the use of a website. These cookies do not contain any personal data, cannot be identified as any specific person, and as long as not otherwise stated, are automatically deleted within two years. This data is not merged with any other data sources.

It is also possible to use the websites without cookies. You can disable or restrict cookies to certain websites via your web browser's security settings or set the browser to inform you as soon as a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from the hard disk of your device at any time via your browser. idealo will subsequently inform you of individual cases where cookies are used. Each third party will include a link enabling you to block the use of cookies (Opt Out). However, such an opt out will no longer remain valid once you have deleted the cookies saved on your device. Every device requires a unique address in order to enable the transmission of data via the Internet – referred to as the IP address. The workings of the Internet therefore ensure that each IP address must be saved for a short period of time. No individual can be recognised from a full IP address without disclosure from the service provider and such disclosure is only permitted under particular circumstances as determined by a court of law. idealo will inform you in unique cases where IP addresses are to be processed further.

In order to satisfy the legal requirement for documentation of your consent to receiving emails from us, idealo saves the IP address used when you register for our services.

Personal information referring to names, addresses or email addresses will not be collected.

The information gathered by the cookies about your website use will normally be transferred and saved to an Optimizely server located in the USA.

### Google AdSense

As far as Google AdSense, an ad service provider by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter referred to as "Google") places ads on the websites (text links, banners, etc.), your browser may save a Google or third-party cookie. The information saved on the cookie can be recorded, collected and analysed by Google or other third parties. Furthermore, to collect information about web browsing activities Google AdSense uses so-called "WebBeacons" (transparent image files), that enables tracking, transferring, collecting and recording of users' navigation through websites. The tracking information generated through the cookie and/or web beacon about your use of the websites is transferred to a server owned by Google in the USA and stored there. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your user patterns relating to the AdSense ads. Google may also transfer this data to third parties where required to do so by law or insofar as third parties have been commissioned by Google to process this data. Google states that it will not associate your IP address with any other data that they hold. Further information and the option of opting-out of this advertising is available at the following link: <https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/anonymous?hl=en>.

### Google Analytics

idealo uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics also uses cookies, which enable the analysis of the user's navigation through and use of the website. The data generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) is generally transferred and stored on a Google server in the USA. idealo has activated IP anonymisation on the websites via the supplemental code “gat._anonymizeIp();” so that Google will truncate your IP address (known as IP masking) within Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. In exceptional cases only, the full IP address will first be transferred to a Google server in the USA and then truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of idealo for the purpose of analysing your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for idealo and providing other services relating to website and Internet use. Google may also transfer this data to third parties where required to do so by law or insofar as third parties have been commissioned by Google to process this data. Any information that Google receives within the scope of Internet-based advertising and from third party providers (e.g. demographic characteristics, gender and interests) could also be included in the cookie information. Google offers a Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, which prevents data from being collected by Google Analytics and processed by Google. This add-on can be downloaded and installed at the user's own risk here: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en

Further information is available at: <https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html> (general information on Google Analytics and privacy protection).

### Google Conversion Tracking

As an advertising client of Google AdWords, idealo uses its Conversion Tracking. Through this, Google adds a cookie whenever a customer reaches the websites via a Google advertisement. These cookies lose their validity after 540 days and cannot be used for personal identification. Each user of AdWords receives a different cookie so that the cookies cannot be traced via the websites of AdWords users. The information which is collected with the help of these conversion cookies is used to create conversion statistics for users of AdWords. No information, however, is collected that could enable AdWords users to identify customers. Further information about Google's privacy policy can be found here: <https://www.google.com/policies/?hl=en>. Users can also, either completely or in part, deactivate or opt out of Google Adverts by going to the following web address: <https://privacy.google.com/?hl=en#google-experience>.

### Google Tag Management

idealo uses the Google Tag Management with which tracking pixels from third party providers that are named here are loaded onto the websites. This is carried out anonymously with pseudonyms as described above and below. The information gathered is impersonal and can be used by idealo and its partners.

The tag manager tool itself (which deploys the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not collect any personally identifiable information. The tool instructs other tags to fire, and these other tags may collect data. This data is not accessed by Google Tag Manager. If users have opted-out at the domain or cookie levels, they will stay opted-out for all of the tracking tags deployed using Google Tag Manager.

Further information can be found here: <https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/faq> and <https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/>

### Google Remarketing for Interest-based Advertising

By means of Google's remarketing technology, users who have visited idealo's websites will see interest-based advertising on websites within the Google Partner Network. Cookies can be used to analyse the interests of users who visit the websites and display relevant product advertising to these users.

Where users have chosen to enable Google to associate their web and app browsing history with their Google account, and to use information from their Google account to personalize ads, Google will use data from its signed-in users together with idealo’s Google Analytics data to build audience lists for cross-device remarketing. In order to support this feature, two things will happen: First, for users on idealo’s website, Google Analytics will collect Google-authenticated identifiers associated with users’ Google Accounts (and therefore, personal information). Second, Google Analytics will temporarily join these identifiers to idealo's Google Analytics data in order to support audiences.

To find out more information or to opt out of this advertising system, please visit <http://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/anonymous?hl=en> (Link “Ads Settings”, then “Off”).

### Twitter Remarketing (Connecting with idealo Users)

This website uses the remarketing function provided by Twitter (Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA). This enables idealo to connect with users on Twitter via tailored advertising. For this purpose, Twitter uses so-called “Tags”. A Tag is used to record visits to the website and collect data relating to the use of the website. When a user visits a website that contains a Tag, Twitter sets a cookie in the user's browser. The unique ID of the cookie is recorded and placed in the target group for remarketing on Twitter.

Twitter users can opt out of this function by visiting <https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171528>.

### Twitter Conversion Tracking

idealo uses Twitter's advertising programme “TwitterAds” and, by extension, Conversion Tracking. When Twitter users click on an idealo advert located on Twitter, a cookie is set for conversion tracking. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days, contain no personal data and cannot be used for personal identification. Advertising customers receive a report from Twitter specifying how many users have seen or clicked on an advert, but this report contains no information relating to who has seen and/or clicked on an advert. These reports contain solely condensed, publicly available or non-personal data. No possibility exists to track cookies via the websites of TwitterAds customers.

Twitter users can opt out of this function by visiting <https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171528>.

For this purpose, Hotjar sets cookies on the user's mobile device or computer and can collect non-personal data (only with an anonymised IP address) such as browser information, operating system, session duration etc. More information is available at <https://www.hotjar.com/privacy>.

This enables idealo to evaluate the success of its Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes.
