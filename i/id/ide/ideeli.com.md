## ideeli Privacy Policy 

ideeli is concerned about your privacy and your experience using our service. This privacy policy describes how we gather, store, and use information about you. This policy applies to the ideeli Sales,the main ideeli website ([www.ideeli.com](https://web.archive.org/)), and all other sites that end in ideeli.com. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [support@ideeli.com](mailto:support@ideeli.com). 

Please note that you may link through the ideeli website to other third party websites. Such sites are not controlled by ideeli, and this privacy policy does not apply to these third party sites. You should review the privacy policy of any website you visit online. 

##### What information does ideeli collect? 

ideeli collects data about you using a number of methods: (1) through your participation in our Sales; (2) on the ideeli website; and (3) through marketing partners. We may collect data through other channels in the future, but for now, these are the primary ways through which we gather data. 

The data we gather about you can vary according to the method through which the data is gathered. When you participate in a Sale, we gather information associated with the telephone (this may be a mobile or land-line phone). If you successfully win an item from a Giveaway or purchase an item during another type of sale, we gather additional information to enable shipping and confirmation of the item and your eligibility. The information we gather, regardless of the channel through which it is gathered, may include your name, address, email, phone, demographic data, ideeli usage data, connection data associated with your mobile device or computer, and service provider data. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future. And we may also combine non-personal data (such as ideeli website usage) with personal information. 

ideeli does not intentionally gather data from or about children. Minors are not permitted to participate in ideeli Sales.
