		<p><b>IDEXX and its subsidiaries do not provide e-mail addresses or
		other personal information to any third parties. Information collected
		on this Web site is used by IDEXX or its affiliates solely for
		internal purposes, as more fully described in the full text of the
		IDEXX Privacy Policy below. </b></p>

		<p>Your privacy, and the privacy of all users of idexx.com, is
		important to us. Accordingly, we have adopted the following Privacy
		Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to information derived from your
		use of this site. This site is administered and maintained by IDEXX
		Laboratories, Inc., of Westbrook, Maine, U.S.A. Use of this site is
		governed by the <a href="terms.jsp">Terms of Use</a> and indicates
		acceptance of such terms.</p>

		<p>Our policy is based on the principles of notice, choice, access and
		security in the collection and use of all information regarding our
		users and their activities at our site.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<h5>1. Notice</h5>

		<p>This policy tells you, among other things, what information we
		gather from you and how we may use or disclose that information, and
		describes our efforts to protect it. Please read this policy
		carefully, and feel free to contact us at the following addresses or
		numbers if you have any questions regarding its contents or concerns
		about our use of your information:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="mailto:webmaster@idexx.com">webmaster@idexx.com</a></li>
			<li>telephone: <b>(800) 548-6733 or (207) 856-0300</b>, ask for

			<br>
			<br>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p><em> Types of Information Collected</em></p>

		<p>You may browse the idexx.com site without providing any
		personally-identifiable information. In connection with your use of
		this site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from
		and about you. This site recognizes the machine name that has been
		assigned by your internet service provider, but this machine name does
		not provide us with any personally identifiable information
		(information that is associated with your name or identity), nor does
		this site recognize your individually identifiable e-mail address.
		Therefore, your individually identifiable e-mail address or other
		personally identifiable information will not be captured or stored for
		future use, unless you submit such information to IDEXX by voluntarily
		completing a registration form or posting a message to IDEXX. This
		registration information may include your name, address, telephone
		number, facsimile number, e-mail address, information about your
		company or organization, and other information needed for a particular
		IDEXX program, promotion, or service. To help IDEXX improve the
		experience of using this site, IDEXX may, through the use of "cookies"
		or other available technology, use a non-individually identifiable
		machine name to track how users navigate through the site. Cookies are
		small files that are stored on a user's computer and are designed to help 
		a Web site operator determine that a particular user has visited the site 
		previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set 
		while the user was browsing the site. These files are used
		to measure which pages are viewed, time spent on certain pages, and
		determining whether a browser has visited the site before. We may also use 
		memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the user of certain IDEXX Web 
		applications. If you are a registered user of a site providing a service to 
		IDEXX customers (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that 
		we can provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated 
		while using the site and to permit your user login to be continuous through the 
		site (without additional logins).  If you reject the cookie, you may still use 
		the IDEXX Web site, but may not have access to or use of certain services. IDEXX 
		controls all cookies on its site. At this time, NO OTHER COMPANIES use cookies 
		on the IDEXX Web site. Information
		may be collected and maintained directly by IDEXX, an IDEXX
		subsidiary, or by a service contractor operating under our
		instructions and subject to this privacy policy.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<p><em>Use of Information</em></p>

		<p>Information collected by IDEXX or submitted upon registration or
		during your use of this site is used solely for responding to your
		request for products, services, or information, or for internal
		purposes including, without limitation, marketing, promotional,
		customer support, Web site administration, and feedback purposes. If
		you supply a mailing address or telephone or facsimile number during
		your use of the site, you may receive periodic mailings, telephone
		calls or facsimiles, whichever the case may be, with information on
		new IDEXX products and services or upcoming events. We may also
		aggregate statistics that we gather about customers, sales or Web site
		traffic and provide this information to third parties on a
		non-personally identifiable (aggregated) basis. All information
		pertaining to Web site users may be processed in countries other than
		your country of residence, and all information may be transferred to,
		processed in, or redisclosed within the United States or other
		countries that may not meet some countries' legal standards for data
		protection.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<p><em>Disclosure of Information</em></p>

		<p>Information may be exchanged among IDEXX, its subsidiaries, and
		service providers as needed to fulfill users' requests. IDEXX does not
		sell e-mail addresses, telephone or facsimile numbers, or other
		personally identifiable information to other companies. We may
		disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory
		requirements if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is
		legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent
		harm, or in accordance with your instructions.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<h5>2. Choice</h5>

		<p>If you object to the use by IDEXX, its subsidiaries, or service
		providers of information collected or submitted during your use of
		this site for the purposes described above, or if you do not wish to
		receive mail, e-mail, telephone calls, or faxes about IDEXX products
		or services, you may request IDEXX to stop such use, mailings or
		telephone calls by notifying the Webmaster at <a href="mailto:webmaster@idexx.com">webmaster@idexx.com</a> or at an
		address or telephone or facsimile number specified above. E-mails sent
		on our behalf include instructions for unsubscribing from our e-mail distribution lists.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<h5>3. Access and Update</h5>

		<p>At any time after you have registered on this site or otherwise
		submitted personally identifiable information to this site, you may
		contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@idexx.com">webmaster@idexx.com</a>
		or at an address or telephone or facsimile number specified above to
		request access to information we have collected regarding you or your
		business or to notify us of changes to such information. If you
		request any such changes, we will contact you by e-mail or facsimile
		to confirm those changes. Once confirmed, any new item or information
		will replace the corresponding information previously provided.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<h5>4. Security</h5>

		<p>If you provide any information to parties who operate Web sites
		that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to
		their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We
		encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any
		sensitive or personal information.</p>

		<p>We use physical, procedural, and technical safeguards to prevent
		unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of
		individually-identifiable information. We instruct our employees that
		information must be handled in accordance with this privacy policy,
		and any misuse by employees is subject to disciplinary action.</p>

		<p>Regardless of the precautions taken by you or us, "perfect
		security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant
		the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit
		sensitive information at your own risk.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>

		<h5>Changes to Privacy Policy</h5>

		<p>It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy
		to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or
		changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards.
		Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any
		time by updating this posting without notice. Visitors should view
		this page from time to time to review the then-current policy. This
		policy was posted on September 11, 2002.</p>
