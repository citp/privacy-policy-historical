<p><br><strong>Use of Information </strong></p>
<p>IDEXX uses your personal information solely to respond to your request for products, services, or information; to fulfill our obligations to you under orders or contracts; to arrange for and process payments owed by you in connection with orders or contracts; or for internal purposes, including without limitation, marketing, promotions, customer support, Website administration, and feedback purposes. If at any time you supply a mailing address, telephone or fax number, or email address to us, you may receive, if permitted under applicable law, periodic mailings, telephone calls, faxes, or emails, whichever the case may be, with information on new IDEXX products and services or upcoming events. We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about customers, sales, or Website traffic and provide this information to third parties on a non-personally identifiable (aggregated) basis.</p>
<p><strong><br>Disclosure of Information </strong></p>
<p>Information may be exchanged among IDEXX, its subsidiaries, and service providers as needed for business purposes, such as account administration, customer service, transaction processing, consumer reporting, processing and delivery of account statements, research and analysis, and delivery of products and services. IDEXX will use contractual or other measures to require service providers to maintain a level of privacy protection comparable to our own practices.</p>
<p>IDEXX may also share information with joint marketing partners to present certain offers to you, but these parties will only be able to access and use your personal information for this limited purpose. In addition, if you opt for direct debit as a payment method, we will share certain personal information with your financial institution in order to arrange for payment. IDEXX does not sell email addresses, telephone or fax numbers, or other personally identifiable information to other companies. We may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements if we believe that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect our legal rights or the rights of others, or to prevent harm, or in accordance with your instructions.</p>
<p>For government information requests, we comply with the laws applicable to us and other entities that process our data, and we provide details only as legally required. For content requests from law enforcement agencies outside the U.S., with the exception of emergency circumstances (defined in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 1986, as amended), IDEXX will only provide content in response to a search warrant issued pursuant to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process or through other cooperative efforts with the United States Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Our policy is to notify people who use our Websites and services of requests for their information prior to our disclosure of it, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or in exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. We will provide delayed notice upon expiration of a specific nondisclosure period in a court order and where we have a good faith belief that exceptional circumstances no longer exist and we are not otherwise prohibited by law from doing so. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited. If our investigation into your data request indicates to us that there is an ongoing violation of our terms of use, we will take action to prevent further abuse, including actions that may notify the user that we are aware of their misconduct.<br><br></p>
<h5> 2. Choice Regarding Consent</h5>
<p>If you object to the use by IDEXX, its subsidiaries, or service providers of your personal information for the purposes described above, or if you do not wish to receive mail, email, telephone calls, or faxes about IDEXX products or services, you may request IDEXX to stop such use, mailings, or telephone calls by notifying the Chief Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:chiefprivacyofficer@idexx.com">chiefprivacyofficer@idexx.com</a> or at an address or telephone or fax number specified above. Emails sent on our behalf include instructions for unsubscribing from our email distribution lists.<br><br></p>
<h5> 3. Access and Updates</h5>
<p>At any time after you have submitted personally identifiable information to us, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:chiefprivacyofficer@idexx.com">chiefprivacyofficer@idexx.com</a> or at an address or telephone or fax number specified above to request access to information we have collected regarding you or your business or to notify us of changes to such information. If you request any such changes, we will contact you by email or fax to confirm those changes. Once confirmed, any new item or information will replace the corresponding information previously provided.<br><br></p>
<h5> 4. Security</h5>
<p>We use commercially reasonable physical, procedural, and technical safeguards to deter unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of individually identifiable information. We instruct our employees that information must be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and any misuse by employees is subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>If you provide any information to parties who operate websites that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites’ policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.</p>
<p>Regardless of the precautions taken by you or us, “perfect security” does not exist. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit sensitive information at your own risk.<br><br></p>
<h5> 5. Enforcement</h5>
<p>We have implemented a self-assessment process to verify adherence to the terms of this policy. If you have any complaints regarding our use and/or disclosure of your personal information, please contact our Chief Privacy Officer through the contact information provided above. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes by reference to the principles contained in this policy.</p>
<p>For users in the European Economic Area, if we are unable to resolve any dispute regarding this Privacy Policy after notification to the Chief Privacy Officer and investigation, we have agreed to cooperate with the dispute resolution procedures provided by the Data Protection Panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities for disputes received from the EU or EEA, and by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner for disputes received from Switzerland. You may send your complaint to the Data Protection Panel secretariat at the following address: European Commission, Directorate General Justice, Data Protection Panel, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; Telephone: +32 2 299 11 11; Fax: +32 2 298 80 94; Email: <a href="mailto:ec-dppanel-secr@ec.europa.eu">ec-dppanel-secr@ec.europa.eu</a>.<br> <br><br><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. We will provide reasonable notice of material changes to this policy, including via links posted on IDEXX Websites. Visitors should view this page from time to time to review the then-current policy.</p>
