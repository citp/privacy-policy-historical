#### I Drive Safely Privacy Policy

To see the **REFER A FRIEND** section of our Privacy Policy, please click here

**Introduction:**

This privacy policy governs the information collection practices of I Drive Safely, LLC's website. The policy below explains how we collect and use the personal information you provide through the website when interacting with it. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. 

**Information Collection:**

I Drive Safely is the sole owner of the information collected on its web site. I Drive Safely collects contact information (including, name, address, driver's license number, email, and phone number), Personally identifiable information (including, driver's license number, SSN, Alien number, DPS Audit number, citation number, County and State information), and demographic information (including zip code, Date of birth, or sex). We will not use or sell this information to promote products or services or in ways different from what are disclosed in this statement. We will deny requests for marketing, scholastic, demographic, or other information requests from entities that could derive commercial or social benefits from such data. 

**Information Use:**

The contact information we collect is used to send the user information about our company and its services and also to help us access your record in case you are experiencing technical difficulties while taking the course. The personally identifiable information we collect online is used for verification of your identity while taking our online course to prevent fraudulent use and for accurate certificate processing with your court. While taking our course online, verification questions will appear on the screen asking you to identify yourself. The correct answers to the questions are based on the information you provided us with during enrollment. Each course has a different security measure depending on the State where you are taking drivers education or where the citation was issued. 

**Registration:**

In order to complete the registration process, a customer is required to provide contact information (name, address, driver's license number, email, and phone number). This information is used to communicate with the customer regarding the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

**Payment:**

In order to process your order we will ask you to provide personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping and credit card billing address (es) so that we can process your order. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for any other purposes. Your personal information is used to get in touch with you if we have trouble processing an order. Our Website does not save your credit card information after the transaction is processed. Your credit card information is saved by a third party service provider that we use for credit card processing services and with which we maintain a written agreement to ensure appropriate security and confidentiality measures are in place to safeguard your personal and financial data. We will not authorize the release of your personal or financial information to anyone not directly involved in processing the transaction. 

**Third Parties:**

We will not share your information with any third party except as outlined within this privacy policy or as required by law to do so. We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, we use third party verification partners for which data is passed for means of authenticating students throughout the course, and we use your court (or court assistance agency contracting with your court) for proper paperwork processing and dismissal. In some instances, your Personally Identifiable Information will be shared with various course providers we contract with to provide course delivery and certificate fulfillment. These agents access our database to offer customer support to students in the respective states, print certificates of completion, and/or report course completions results to regulatory bodies. Information provided by our customers, or personal information obtained from public databases for validation purposes, is used exclusively for the purpose of the desired service. 

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website, or as required by law. 

**Refer-A-Friend Program:**

I Drive Safely has created a **REFER A FRIEND** Program, which may be applicable to some of our courses. When applicable, Participation in the **REFER A FRIEND** Program may require users to submit personal information about themselves and their friends (collectively "Users"), including name and e-mail address. The personal information will be collected, processed and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy Statement and the program Administrator's Privacy Policy which can be found at <http://www.nextbee.com/privacy.htm>. 

We do not utilize any information processed through the **REFER A FRIEND** program. The information gathered and processed by the **REFER A FRIEND** script is purely used as intended and will never be used in any way other than to facilitate the intended purpose of allowing an individual to make a referral. The personal information may be used by I Drive Safely or Administrator, on I Drive Safely's behalf, to contact Users with regards to participation in the Program and to receive communications from I Drive Safely. If you register for the Refer a Friend program, you may receive promotional communications. You can opt out of these by unsubscribing through the link in the email.

In common with the majority of websites you visit, this site employs log files. These log files record data from visitors to this site. The data gathered is non personal and may include things such as your: internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP) name, entry and exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track customer's movement, and gather broad demographic information for our exclusive use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Occasionally we may need to disclose aggregate statistics from our logs that do not contain personally identifiable information, when dealing with service providers, affiliates or business partners. 

**Cookie/Tracking Technology:**

I Drive Safely makes use of third party technology, including tracking technology and use of cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. In addition to our own cookies, some third party cookies may be set. These cookies are for marketing and statistical analysis only; these third party data cookies do not contain any personal information.If a user rejects any cookie, they may still use our site.This will not limit the user from any portion of the site.For this purpose our persistent cookies are tied to personal information, but do not contain or expose your personal information to others.We accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on our web site usage to a third party vendor for website usage analysis, but this does not contain any personally identifiable information about you. 

**Security:**

This website takes precautions to protect our customers' information. When customers submit sensitive information via the website, the information is secured both online and off-line. When a customer is required to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is secured using industry leading encryption software. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser (while on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are browsing a non-secure page), or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect customer information offline. All of our customer's information, encompassing more than the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customer's information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Special Notifications:**

I Drive Safely courses are designed to generate email notifications at certain intervals throughout the course. These emails are exclusively related to the products and services offered through **www.idrivesafely.com** , and may be in conjunction with services subscribed to by the customer.
