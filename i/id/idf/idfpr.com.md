**SECURITY OF INFORMATION COLLECTED**

When you enter personally identifying information it is collected through a secure encrypted tunnel (SSL.) Storage of this information is secured in a system with a user-ids and password. 

**What is SSL?**

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology is a security protocol. It is today's de-facto standard for securing communications and transactions across the Internet. SSL has been implemented in all of the major browsers and Web servers, and as such, plays a major role in today's e-commerce and e-business activities on the Web. 

The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create a secure, confidential communications "pipe" between two entities. Data transmitted over an SSL connection can not be tampered with or forged without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the tampering. The newest version of SSL standard has been renamed TLS (Transport Layer Security). You will often see these terms used interchangeably. Since the term SSL is more commonly understood, we will continue to use it throughout this paper. 

The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation's Web server certificate is a certificate that authenticates the identity of a Web site to visiting browsers. When a browser user wants to send confidential information to a Web server, the browser will access the server's digital certificate. The certificate, which contains the Web server's public key, will be used by the browser to: 

\- authenticate the identity of the Web server (the Web site), and 

\- encrypt information for the server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. 

Since the Web server is the only one with access to its private key, only the server can decrypt the information. This is how the information remains confidential and tamper-proof while in transit across the Internet.
