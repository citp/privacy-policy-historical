An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his/her query to admin@brsmedia.com. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed 10 working days.

How We Protect Your Data

The security and reliability of our service is our number one priority.

Prevention is best when it comes to security, and as a first step, we follow all Code Standards in the platforms that we build and use.  
In addition, we have an extensive internal review and Quality Assurance process in place specifically to prevent potential security vulnerabilities in our platforms and services.  
Every employee and contractor goes through background and onboarding process that includes a trial period where access to customer data is provided only when working directly under the supervision of another staff member.  
All staff only have access to systems that are directly required to complete the functions of their job. We use dual factor authentication for all critical systems and communications services, and automatically log all staff activity using an internal logging tool, Google G' Suite features, and Amazon Cloud Trail.  
All staff (including any contractors) undergo initial training to ensure proper understanding of all security-related processes. Staff regularly attend industry conferences and otherwise stay informed of best practices and relevant trends. Staff review and agree, in writing, to all policies and procedures annually.  
We only use third-party services, such as Amazon Web Services, that are fully vetted and adhere to the highest levels of privacy and security practices.

Security Policy

How We Protect Information about our Customers

Industry-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption (https://) is always used to protect your purchase information while in transit.  
Stored credit card information is always encrypted and maintained in an environment that has been certified as PCI DSS compliant by a qualified security assessor.  
BRS Media websites are constantly scanned and validated to verify application and network security.  
All internal security standards, policies and practices are frequently reviewed and improved based on the current industry security practices.

What Data Breach Procedures We Have In Place

Should any event occur where customer data has been lost, stolen, or potentially compromised, our policy is to alert our customers via email no later than 48 hours of our team becoming aware of the event. We will also report such incident to any required data protection authority. We will work closely with any customers affected to determine next steps such as any end-user notifications, needed patches, and how to avoid any similar event in the future.

Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, BRS Media may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in BRS Media's sole discretion.
