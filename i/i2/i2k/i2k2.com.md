# Privacy Policy - i2k2 Networks

We, at i2k2 Networks, value the privacy of the visitors we receive on our website - i2k2.com, and the ones who respond to our advertisements or send e-mail. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect and how it is used, to help you understand when and how personal data is collected, used, disclosed and protected. 

## Network Security

i2k2 Networks deploys a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards, and uses robust encryption technologies to protect your personal information against all possible vulnerabilities, no matter whether you are viewing your bill or requesting information about our services.   
i2k2 Networks, however, has no control over the security of other sites on the internet you might visit, interact with, or from which you buy products or services. To prevent unauthorized access to your account information, you must keep your username, password and other access information confidential, and adopt passwords that should not be easy to guess. 

## Personal Information

As this information is critical to our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale, or any other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. 

## How We Use the Collected Information

I2k2 Networks uses the information we collect to provide you with the service(s) you have ordered and to let you know about other offerings that may be of interest to you. Postal and e-mail address, for instance, enable us to communicate updates about services offered and ordered, and ensure seamless provisioning and billing of services.   
It is important to note that we can provide personally-identifiable information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or take a legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with i2k2 Networks’ property or services, or with our customers' or others' use of them.
