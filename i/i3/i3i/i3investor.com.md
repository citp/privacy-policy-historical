# Privacy Policy | I3investor

Welcome to I3investor. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

I3investor may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy in a material manner we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this policy.

#### 1\. What information do we collect and how is it used?

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/jsp/general/tac.jsp). We collect the following types of information about you: 

**Information we receive from third parties:** I3investor is currently available to users who register with the I3investor portal directly, or users who login through Facebook account and authorize access through Facebook Connect. By connecting to I3investor with Facebook Connect, you give us permission to access, store and use your information from Facebook including, but not limited to, your Facebook UID, any information that you have permitted Facebook to share with us, any information you have made public in connection with that service, any interests that are not hidden and mutual friends that you may have in common with another User. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. 

**Information you provide us directly:** We ask for certain information such as your first and last name, Facebook UID and e-mail address if you correspond with us or submit an inquiry. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service and to keep the site safe. 

**Analytics information.** We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser that assist us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user. 

**Cookies information:** When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets I3investor help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service, and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

**Log file information:** Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. 

**Geo-location data:** When you access the Service, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “geo-location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding your location. 

**Communications:** We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, product features, technical and security notices). 

**Use of certain service type information we collect about you:** We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising and (h) to keep the site safe. 

#### 2\. Who is your information shared with?

We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside I3investor (including any parent, subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below:

**Who we may share your information with:** We may share your information with third-party business partners to assist them in providing a better experience for you and with partners that we have engaged to help ensure site safety. 

**What happens in the event of a change of control:** We may sell, assign or otherwise transfer user information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the I3investor. 

**Instances where we are required to share your information:** I3investor will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/jsp/general/tac.jsp) or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of I3investor, our Users or others. 

**Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:** We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties. 

**Ads on I3investor:** We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. I3investor may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. I3investor does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes. 

Please note that an advertiser may ask I3investor to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, I3investor determines the target audience and I3investor serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

The I3investor Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
