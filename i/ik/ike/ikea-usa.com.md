# IKEA | Privacy Policy

#### A partnership in trust.

When IKEA set out to create a high-quality, low-priced line of home furnishings, we knew we couldn't do it without the help of some very important partners-you, our customers. Whether you're researching purchases in the IKEA catalog, picking up your furniture in our self-serve warehouses or assembling your purchases at home - we're working together to help you create a better everyday life at a price everyone can afford. IKEA is based on a partnership with our customers. Without you, IKEA could not exist. 

This partnership extends to the way we handle your personal information. Just like shopping at IKEA is a cooperative experience, IKEA makes a point of working with our customers when it comes to their privacy. We only collect the information we may need to create a better shopping experience for you. This Privacy Policy is our way of telling you what information we collect, how we use it and how you can access, change and remove your information. 

#### Help us build a better IKEA.

In order to create a better IKEA, we need your help. You can help by providing us with various kinds of information to help IKEA serve you better, and ultimately improve IKEA for everyone. Below you’ll find some of the reasons we request information from you, as well as how we obtain and use that information to help improve your IKEA shopping experience. 

Catalog – When you request a catalog from us, you provide us with contact information, such as your name, address, phone number and email address, so we may fulfill your request. When you subscribe to our email list, you provide us information such as your email address, name and ZIP code so we may communicate with you via email. We will send you email only if you have provided us with your email address and have asked us to communicate with you this way. To update your email communication preferences, or to unsubscribe, please [click here.](http://info.ikea-usa.com/IkeaOptin/Registration.aspx)

Purchases – When you order or purchase an IKEA product, you may be required to give us contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so we may process your order. When you pay for an IKEA product using a credit card, we use your credit card information only to fulfil your order and for other internal purposes. If you place an order through our website, one of our customer service representatives will call you after you have placed the order to fulfil the transaction you have requested. 

Customer Service – If you contact one of our customer service representatives, we may ask you for information such as your name, address and email address so we can respond to your questions or comments. With your consent, we may retain this information to personalize your experience with us and better assist you the next time you contact us. 

Website - Many web surfers are concerned about their privacy and the use of 'cookies' on the Internet. Cookies are small files that can be used to store information you have already provided. Cookies cannot be used to "steal" information about you or your computer system. The IKEA web site uses cookies to remember your preferences. For example, the web site may remember which IKEA store page you view, in order to make your next visit more convenient (by displaying information more relevant to that store location). Nevertheless, if you don't like having any cookies at all they can be disabled in your web browser's Internet Options. 

Kid's Ballroom - To take advantage of our supervised children's play area and ballroom while you shop, we require you to fill out a registration card that asks for the child's name and age, and the caretaker's name, address, telephone number and signature. We ask for this information to help ensure the safety and security of the child. 

Mobile - IKEA offers our customers the ability to find out what’s new at their local IKEA store through their mobile device, either by browsing our mobile web site or through SMS (short message service) messaging. Usage of the mobile web site follows similar standards employed by our standard web site; cookies may be employed to remember preferences or previous activity but do not reveal personal information and can be disabled using your mobile device’s Internet options. For SMS messaging, users will only receive messages if they have specifically opted in for them; standard text message rates will apply. To join IKEA Mobile, text the keyword "JOIN" to 62345. To unsubscribe from IKEA Mobile, text the keyword "STOP" to 62345. 

Other information you provide to us - Through surveys, web forms, or SMS messages, you may provide us with information such as product preferences, reasons for purchasing a product, family and lifestyle information to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. You also may provide such information when you fill out a warranty card about a product you purchased from IKEA. In addition, you may give us such information if you register for or redeem IKEA special offers, discount coupons or other promotions. 

#### How does IKEA protect personal information?

The security of personal information is a high priority for us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration and destruction of the personal information in our possession. We are committed to providing appropriate security controls to protect personal information we have about you against foreseeable hazards. 

#### How does IKEA update its Privacy Policy?

IKEA services and promotions will change over time. This Privacy Notice will be updated periodically to reflect those changes and corresponding changes in our information practices. Whenever we revise this Privacy Notice, we will change the date on the notice to indicate when the revisions were made. We reserve the right to change our information practices and the terms of this Privacy Notice, and to apply the changed practices to all information we have about you. By using this web site, you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Notice as stated at the time you use it. Any future access to this web site subsequent to the posting of a revised Privacy Notice will be deemed to be your acceptance of this Privacy Notice as then revised. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice at any time.
