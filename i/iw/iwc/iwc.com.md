# Privacy Policy

### Use of Personal Information, Privacy Policy

Any personally identifiable information such as your name, address, contact numbers and preferences etc. ("Personal Information") you make available to IWC is done so voluntarily, with your knowledge and consent when making a request, submission or registration for services from IWC. Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (indicated with an asterisk (*)) and non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then IWC or one of its subsidiaries and  affiliated companies, may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option choices.

Requests for information made by telephone may be recorded for quality control and to ensure the accuracy of your Personal Information.

Personal Information provided to IWC by you will be made available for joint use by duly authorised IWC personnel in Switzerland, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies worldwide, its Customer Relations management agencies and occasionally to other persons or companies who carry out operations in relation to our business, joint marketing operations  and data cleansing. Our subsidiaries and some of our business partners are located outside Switzerland and consequently you accept and consent that your Personal Information may be either imported to Switzerland and/or transferred abroad for the purposes set out herein. All such persons and companies are subject to confidentiality agreements, and protection of your Personal Information shall be ensured at all times in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

The Personal Information made available by you will be used exclusively to provide the requested services and may be used both for marketing research purposes relating to IWC's business and to provide you with information on IWC’s products, services and events. Personal Information will be stored by IWC for a maximum time of seven years.  If you have registered for an e-mail service you no longer wish to receive, you can opt-out through an automated service by following the instructions at the end of the e-mail.

### Note to children

Children who are under age (minors), especially those under the age of 13, should not send any information about themselves or their friends and should not register for any of the IWC online services, nor should they make requests to receive further information from IWC by clicking consent or request buttons on the website. Should we discover or be informed that a child has registered his/her or another child's personal details, we will delete such information from our records.

IWC will not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under age.
