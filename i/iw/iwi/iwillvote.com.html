<p><i>Last Revised: April 2, 2010</i></p>

<p>This website is operated by the Democratic National Committee (the "DNC", "we" or "us").  This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by the DNC with respect to your use of the Web sites such as this which are operated by the DNC and which display this Policy (the "Sites") so you can make an informed decision about using the Sites. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated.  We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>

<h3>What Is Personal Information?</h3>

<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number) and information about that individual or his or her activities that is directly linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.  This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>

<p><span class="pLabel">Active Collection</span>: Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Sites.  We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account or a profile, make a donation, make a purchase, send us an email or sign up to receive email or text message updates, fill out a form, connect through a social feed, sign up to be a volunteer or host an event, request information, or apply for an internship, or use the Voter Registration Form tool.  Such information may include personal information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card information.  Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting blog comments or other content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Sites.  In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, contests, games, promotions, and other activities on the Sites.</p>

<p>In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may require us to collect personal information from donors.  For example, the FEC requires us to collect (and disclose) the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of all individuals whose donations exceed $200 per calendar year.</p>

<p>If you use our Voter Registration Form tool, you may also provide your driver's license number, your social security number or the last four digits of your social security number, but that information is deleted after the form is printed, so we do not retain it.</p>

<p><span class="pLabel">Passive Collection</span>: When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on our Sites. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>

<p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website.  Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience.  If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information.  If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.  However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features on our Sites.  Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Sites or in emails relating to the Sites to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Sites.</p>

<p>Third party vendors, such as Google DoubleClick, Yahoo Tremor and 24/7 RealMedia, may use cookies or other technologies to serve ads on other websites based on your visits to this site and other sites on the Internet. These third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number). They do this using cookies, clear gifs or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising on other websites targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs used by the third parties, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.
