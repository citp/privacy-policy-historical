### Privacy Policy

Your privacy on the Internet is important to iWin. As part of the operation of iWin.com, certain information is gathered about those who visit iWin.com's Web site and/or who register on iWin.com's Web site ("Players"). Below are explanations regarding the type of information collected, what is done with it, and how to correct or change the information. 

BY REGISTERING THROUGH iWin.COM OR ANY OF ITS PARTNERS, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT REGISTER, OR, IF YOU ARE ALREADY REGISTERED, YOU MUST END YOUR MEMBERSHIP.

**What Information is Collected**

**Required Information:** As part of the iWin.com registration process, our Players are asked to provide a name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, birth date, user name, password, and gender. We use this information to send Players their winnings, confirm their credit card information and determine if the jurisdiction that you are a resident of allows you to play these games for real money. 

**Use of Information**

iWin.com uses information to deliver the iWin.com services. Thus, Player Information is used by iWin.com in identifying information that may be of interest to its Players. A Player's e-mail address will be used by iWin.com to contact that Player about Player-selected interests. iWin.com does not use Player information for purposes unrelated to the services offered by iWin.com. 

The "Refer A Friend" option authorizes us to send an email to your friends. Your friends will not receive any other e-mail from iWin.com not relating to that promotion. Additionally broadcast e-mails are occasionally sent to our Players to keep our Players aware of our promotions, prizes, and sponsor offers. In addition, iWin.com also reserves the right to use the information collected to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers you'll find valuable. 

Players may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional emails from iWin.com by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the iWin.com e-mail.

By registering for an account, you agree that iWin.com may display your player name and tournament records. 

**Confidentiality**

iWin.com will not provide personally identifiable information of a iWin.com Player to third parties.Personally identifiable information means the Player's name, residence address, e-mail address, telephone number or other information from which the Player's identity may be reasonably ascertained. 

All iWin.com employees are required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy provides that employees are obligated to keep Player information confidential. This obligation continues once an employee has left our Company. 

**Using Your Social Security Number**

If your total winnings on the Site in any given calendar year are greater than $600, iWin.com will request that you submit your social security number in order to send you a Form 1099, as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations. Failure to provide your social security number at that time will result in the Site's inability to credit your account for any winnings in excess of $600. 

**The Use of Cookies and Clear GIFs**

As an important and necessary part of providing customizable and personalized services to our Players, iWin.com uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about Players. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a Player's browser from a Web server and stored on a Player's computer hard drive. Areas of iWin.com's Web Site where Players are prompted to login or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. Cookies are also used to help iWin.com track the response to messages sent to Players on behalf of marketers so that iWin.com can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track response history. In addition, banner advertisements are displayed on our Web Site which may contain cookies. While iWin.com uses cookies in other parts of our Web Site, the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertising partners, and iWin.com does not have access to this information. With respect to cookies, you have a choice. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you will be unable to use those iWin.com services that require the use of cookies in order to participate. 

iWin.com also uses a common technology known as a clear gif or action tags on the Web Site and in e-mail communications with Players. A clear gif (standing for "graphic interface format") is a small graphic image that is 1x1 pixel that iWin.com or one of its Partners places on a page of the Web Site. iWin.com may also occasionally place clear gifs in e-mail messages that it sends to Players. Clear gifs provide iWin.com with important information about how Players use the Web Site and respond to e-mail messages. This helps iWin.com to better track certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of its outreach to Players. iWin.com may also allow its advertisers and Partners the ability to use clear gifs on the Web Site solely to track Players who link from their respective sites to this Site, though this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access any Player's personal information to which they are not otherwise entitled.

**Changing User Information**

To change, update, or delete any information in your Member Account click ?Preferences? and then ?User Profile?. 

**Children's Online Privacy Protection**

The safety of children is important to us. iWin.com's Web Site is a general audience site that is not directed to children under the age of 18. Similarly, iWin.com's services are not directed to or intended for anyone under the age of 18. iWin.com will not knowingly accept Players who are under the age of 18 years nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from or about anyone under the age of 18 years iWin.com relies on the truthfulness of the registration when accepting new Players. In the event that iWin.com receives information that establishes that a Player is under the age of 18 years, iWin.com reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate that Player's membership or take other steps that it determines are appropriate in the circumstances, such as providing parental notification. iWin.com may also delete all information in our databases about that terminated Player. 

**Sale or Acquisition of iWin.com**

Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to contrary, we may, and you authorize us to, disclose your personally identifiable to an entity which purchases or acquires all or substantially all of iWin.com's assets or all or substantially all of iWin.com's Web Site operations.

**Protection of Player Information and Credit Card Processing**

iWin.com undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about individual Players and will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside iWin.com other than to the Player or as described in this Privacy Policy. iWin.com has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the iWin.com Web Site, including the confidentiality of information collected about iWin.com Players. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. 

You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your iWin.com Player name and password are confidential and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, neither iWin.com's Web Site nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Player information, iWin.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of Player information. Thus, any information a Player transmits to us is done so at the Player's own risk. Once we receive Player information, iWin.com undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Policy. Your information may be stored, processed and transferred to or from the United States or any other country where iWin.com, its Partners, affiliates or agents are located.

When you are entering your credit card information and this information is being processed iWin.com uses a secure server, and the secure server software (SSL) encrypts the information you input. 

**Policy Changes**

The foregoing policy is effective as of November 2001. iWin.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of iWin.com's services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. In the event that iWin.com intends to change this policy, iWin.com will post a message on the home page of its Web Site that states that the Privacy Policy has been changed, and will provide a link to the Privacy Policy. These postings will occur on iWin.com's Web Site for at least 30 days prior to any material change. For more information, see our Official Rules.
