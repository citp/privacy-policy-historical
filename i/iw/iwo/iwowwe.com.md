# iWowWe- Video Email, Video Conference and Video Broadcast

Updated and effective January 1, 2011

##### Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the iWowWe web site ("Site"). We appreciate the opportunity to interact with you on the Internet and are committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we might collect from you when you visit our Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct that information.

##### What Information We Collect and How We Use It

Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following three categories: 

  * Personally Identifiable Information
  * Secure Information
  * Aggregate Usage Information



Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that provides detail about you as a person. In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You may, however, voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, e-mail address, and phone number) for us to contact you, including via e-mail, to respond to your comments or inquiries. In such event, we might maintain a record of your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information. We use this information to provide better service in the event you contact us again.

Secure Information: This refers to information that is generally used for identity theft (e.g., credit card information, social security number, etc.). Secure Information is a subset of Personally Identifiable Information that receives a higher level of protection in our system through specialized encryption.

Aggregate Usage Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web site that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Usage Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Usage Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Usage Information to you; it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.

iWowWe may seek Personally Identifiable Information from Members, through its private Site, to provide you with a service, place an order, or fulfill a request. We will never discuss Secure Information with anyone but the member providing the information. Sharing Your Information

##### Sharing Your Information

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise retransmit any Personally Identifiable Information we collect online unless we have your permission. Any Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us will be stored in our databases in the United States.

We may share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online with other iWowWe-related entities and/or trusted business partners with whom we collaborate on our Site functions and activities, as well as those that provide services to our Site. Where we engage non-affiliated third-party agents or contractors for these purposes, we will require them to also protect the confidentiality and integrity of your Personally Identifiable Information and observe the intent of this Privacy Statement.

From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.

iWowWe or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or its respective assets could be acquired. Should such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to companies serving you and other users of our Site in continuing to provide the services of our Site.

##### Your Choices

Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.

##### Accessing and Correcting Your Information

We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our Site is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us through our public Site, you may contact us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below. iWowWe Users may modify their own Personally Identifiable Information directly through our Virtual Office private Site.
