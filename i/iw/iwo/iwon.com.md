**Your Privacy Rights**

**Last Updated: May 01, 2012**

The [www.IWON.com](http://www.iwon.com/) website (the "IWON Site") respects the privacy of our users and has developed this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the IWON Site or our services (collectively, the "IWON Services"), the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. 

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the IWON Site or the IWON Services or transacting business with us. By using the IWON Site or IWON Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

The IWON Site is operated by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. ("IWON", "we" or "us"), a part of the IAC family of businesses ([www.iac.com](http://www.iwon.com/)), which includes Ask.com, Zwinky.com, Girlsense.com, Match.com, Vimeo, College Humor, and many others. 

If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.

Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States. 

Aggregated and non-personal information. We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and other IAC companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources.

Non-personal information (such as your user name) is publicly viewable via your user profile on the IWON Site. **Any visitor to the IWON Site can view any users' profile pages**.

**We may, but do not have the obligation to screen, filter or monitor user submissions to the website, nor do we scrape or glean personal information from any such submissions; however, to the extent that any comment or other user submission contains personal information (whether name, likeness, address, telephone number or otherwise, and whether such information pertains to the submitter or someone else), such personal information may be viewed by other users of the website**. See "USER SUBMISSIONS", below.

**THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES**

There are a number of places on or via the IWON Site or IWON Services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information from you, including personal information, and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. 

We offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by IWON and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded services will contain IWON branding, but may not be hosted by IWON. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by", if standard IWON branding is not displayed on the top of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information. In such cases, if you use the co-branded service, IWON may be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service. 

If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.

If you have registered with the IWON Site, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into [your account](http://registration.iwon.com/reg/member_info_login.jhtml?capID=).

If you have registered with the IWON Site you also may choose to close your account at any time by clicking [here](http://registration.iwon.com/cancel/selfcancel/jsp).

Please note that it may take up to 5 business days for your cancellation request to be processed. If you are unable to sign in to cancel your account, please visit our lost password page at the following URL: <http://www.iwon.com/passwordreset.jhtml>. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. 

**YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

  * You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in your inability to use or access certain features of the IWON Site or IWON Services, purchase products or services, participate in a promotion, ask a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.

We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
  * You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by going to the My Account page and editing your preferences with respect to the sharing of information or by contacting customer service.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. 

We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. 

**FORUMS**

The IWON Site may offer profile pages and/or various forums or other areas for users to engage in public commentary or discussions, where you can post information about yourself and others, and communicate with other users. Such postings are governed by our [Terms of Service](http://www.iwon.com/modules/pages/support/termsofservice.jhtml). In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.

If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.

Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
