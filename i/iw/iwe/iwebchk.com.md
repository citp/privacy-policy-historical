Therefore, they can be accessed manually online by others since the information is publicly available online (Whois, Alexa, Google, Dmoz, W3C).

Additionally every single report can be indexed by search engines which may place them in searches online.

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others rights, property, or safety.
