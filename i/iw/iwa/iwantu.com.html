      IwantU.com PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
	  <p>Effective On: August 27th, 2004
	    </p><p> IwantU.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for http://www.IwantU.com. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: 
	    </p><p> 1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site <br>
  2. The organization collecting the information <br>
  3. How the information is used <br>
  4. With whom the information may be shared <br>
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information <br>
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Mana Internet Solutions control <br>
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 
	    </p><p> If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact our customer service department at <a href="http://support.IwantU.com/">http://support.IwantU.com</a><br>
  You may also reach us at our mailing address:
	    </p><p> Mana Internet Solutions<br>
	        BP 802 Succ B<br>
  Montreal, QC<br>
  H3B-3K5 Canada 
	    </p><p> If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>

      </p><h2> Information Collection and Use </h2>
      <p> Mana Internet Solutions is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Mana Internet Solutions collects information from our users at several different points on our website such as the registration form, membership purchase and product purchases. 
      </p><p> The member's personal information will not be sold or shared with any other company for promotional purposes. 
      </p><h2> Registration </h2>
      <p> In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information such as your name, e-mail address, age, gender, zip code, city and hobbies in order to receive their password and Aphrodite matches with other members. 
      </p><p> This information is used to contact the user about their membership, to send Aphrodite matches, or to contact users about services on our site for which they have expressed interest.<br>
  Members have the choice of either receiving Aphrodite matches in their IwantU.com Message mailbox, their registered e-mail address or request not to receive date emails. Aphrodite uses the age, city, zip code and other information to find the best match to their profile relying on likes, dislikes and distance between members. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 
      </p><h2> <b>Membership purchase</b> </h2>
      <p> When purchasing a VIP membership, a third party gathers personal information in order to validate the member's account information. That data is gathered by the billing company under secure servers and is not shared by anyone other than the credit company. 
      </p><p> Please note that this information is solely used for validation and no mailing will be sent to the address provided. The billing company will send us a receipt of purchase once the transaction is approved. When communicating with the Admin or registering for any survey, contest or advice, the user's e-mail address is required in order to receive a reply. 
      </p><h2> <b>Cookies</b> </h2>
      <p> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. 
      </p><p> For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies are placed on the registration and login page. 
      </p><p> If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site without any drawback. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
      </p><p> Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, Ibill and our online store). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 
      </p><h2> <b>Log Files</b> </h2>
      <p> We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, monitor spammers and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 
      </p><p> IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 
      </p><h2> <b>Sharing</b> </h2>
      <p> We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 
      </p><p> We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company Ibill to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
      </p><p> We partner with another party to provide specific services such as our online store. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 
      </p><p> We also partner with Cashring.com the associate program for IwantU.com Select Clubs. Profile information is shared with them in order to credit affiliates with the appropriate commission. 
      </p><p> These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 
	    
	  </p><h1>Legal disclaimer</h1>
	  <p> We will disclose personal information about our members if and when is required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 
	    </p><h2> <b>Links</b> </h2>
	  <p> This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we Mana Internet Solutions are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
	    </p><h2> <b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b> </h2>
	  <p> From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
	    </p><h2> <b>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</b> </h2>
	  <p> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. IwantU.com does not disclose any of our members' personal information to the forum, but instead has ach user post with a unique anonymous username. 
	    </p><h2> <b>Tell-A-Friend</b> </h2>
	  <p> If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. IwantU.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. IwantU.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact IwantU.com at http://support.IwantU.com to request the removal of this information from their database. 
	    </p><h2> <b>Security</b> </h2>
	  <p> This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 
	    </p><p> When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
	    </p><p> While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 
	    </p><p> If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an visit <a href="http://support.IwantU.com/">http://support.IwantU.com.</a>
      </p><h2> <b>Special Offers</b> </h2>
      <p> We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive this communication. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 
      </p><h2> <b>Site and Service Updates</b> </h2>
      <p> We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 
      </p><h2> <b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b> </h2>
      <p> If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as their zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done on the member's profile information by editing their profile and submitting their request. All data is then updated in our system. 
      </p><p> In order to cancel a membership, members need to fill out the Cancel Membership form from the Profile page. Once a cancellation is processed all information is deleted from the database and no further access is provided. 
      </p><p> For handle or gender change, members need to visit <a href="http://support.IwantU.com/">http://support.IwantU.com</a> with their request. 
      </p><h2> <b>Choice/Opt-out</b> </h2>
      <p> Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site during registration. If they wish not to receive our newsletter they can opt-out by unsubscribing during registration, by following the instructions contained in the email, by simply cancelling their membership or going to <a href="http://support.IwantU.com/">http://support.IwantU.com</a>. 
      </p><p> Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 
      </p><h2> <b>Notification of Changes</b> </h2>
      <p> If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
      </p><p> We will post changes to this privacy statement, the homepage and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
      </p><h2> <b>Software Download Disclaimer</b> </h2>
      <p> The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.</p>
