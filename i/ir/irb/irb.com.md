Privacy policy

The International Rugby Board ("IRB") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following is a full description of our information gathering and dissemination practices for www.irb.com and other Internet web sites owned by the IRB and its associated companies. 

**Collection of Information**  
In general, you can visit the IRB website(s) without providing personal information. However, there may be times when we will request personal information in order to participate in our site's activities. Information is typically requested when you wish to enter contests, contact us, or participate in one of our online debates. We do not presently collect information when you visit our web site through the use of "cookies". A cookie is a small piece of information which a web site stores through your web browser on your PC that it can later retrieve when you log back on to the site. This means that the site will remember your preferences. 

When you submit personal information to the IRB through our web site(s), you agree that your information may be stored and processed by the IRB. 

The IRB reserves the right to perform statistical analysis of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site(s) and to ascertain the number of users that have visited particular web pages. The IRB will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. The IRB confirms that in general it will only use the information you provide within the IRB. Where we want to pass the information on to someone else we will tell you - refer to the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting the information and to whom it will be made available. The option will then be yours to submit the information or not.

**How We Use the Information**  
We collect and use your information in order to give you better service, to provide you with information on IRB Tournaments, updates on Laws and other developments in the Game and to make our website more useful to you. The contact information we collect is used to deliver the information you request from us. It is also used to contact you when necessary (e.g. competition winners).

The IRB will only disclose your personal information without notice when it believes disclosure to be required by law or regulation, or necessary to protect or defend the rights or property of the IRB, the safety of the public or the users of its site(s). 

**Public Forums**  
Our site makes forums, message boards and/or newsgroups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas is public information. The IRB is not responsible for the content or protection of any information disclosed in these areas. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
The IRB's web site(s) may contain links to other sites whose privacy and information practices may be different to ours. You should consult the other sites' privacy notices. The IRB is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of other sites. 

**Security**  
We use physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard the information we collect from you online. We urge you to take precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often and make sure you use a secure browser.
