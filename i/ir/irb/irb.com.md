# International Rugby Board - privacy

The International Rugby Board ("IRB") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following is a full description of our information gathering and dissemination practices for [www.irb.com](http://www.irb.com/) ("the site").

Collection of Information

In general, you can visit the site without providing personal information. However, there may be times when we will request personal information in order that you may participate in our site's activities. Information is typically requested when you wish to enter contests, contact us, or subscribe to our newsletter or other subscription services.

In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called 'cookies' on this site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We only use cookies for one purpose: to tell us in what language the site should be presented to you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies being stored.

When you submit personal information to IRB through our site, you agree that your information may be stored and processed by IRB.

IRB reserves the right to perform statistical analysis of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to ascertain the number of users that have visited particular web pages. IRB will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. IRB confirms that in general it will only use the information you provide within IRB. Where we want to pass the information on to someone else we will tell you - refer to the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting the information and to whom it will be made available. The option will then be yours to submit the information or not.

How We Use the Information

We collect and use your information in order to give you better service, to provide you with information on the International Rugby Board and its events and on Rugby Union and to make our site more useful to you. The contact information we collect is used to deliver the information you request from us. For example, if you request us to do so, we will contact you when our third party supplier's audio/visual content service is available for you to subscribe to. Your personal information is also used to contact you when necessary (e.g. winners of competitions or games).

You have the right to prevent marketing information being sent direct to you. If you prefer not to receive information from us or from any other organisation to which we may disclose your personal information, ensure that you do not tick the "opt in" box which appears where you are submitting your personal data. If you wish, at any time, to be removed from our newsletter list, please send an email with "unsubscribe" in the Subject line to irb@irb.com.

The organisations to which, with your permission, we will release your personal information are limited to our worldwide partners, tournament sponsors and official suppliers (including [ADD SPONSORS' NAMES]), IRB and/or its associated companies, the International Rugby Board, and/or the Member Unions thereof. IRB will only disclose your personal information without notice when it believes disclosure to be required by law or regulation, or necessary to protect or defend the rights or property of IRB, the safety of the public or the users of its site.

Electronic Communications

We comply with the terms of the European Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (Directive 2002/58/EC) and, in particular:

  * We will not send you unsolicited communications unless you have consented to receiving them;
  * Communications we do send you will always give you an address which you may contact to opt out of receiving further communications.



Please understand that where you have opted out of receiving further communications, it may take us a few days to process your request.

Children under 16

If you are under 16, you must obtain the approval of a parent or guardian before you send us any of your personal information (such as your name, e-mail address, home address, date of birth etc).

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change our security and privacy policies at any time. Accordingly, we recommend that you check this page periodically in order to review our current policies.

Links to Other Sites

IRB's site may contain links to other websites whose privacy and information practices may be different to ours. You should consult the other websites' privacy notices. IRB is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of other websites.

Security

We use physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard the information we collect from you online. We urge you to take precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Keep any passwords safe and make sure you use a secure browser.

Use of your information outside the European Union

Some of the organisations to which we may disclose your personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your personal information to these countries some of which do not protect privacy and personal data rights as extensively as in the European Union. If you do not consent to your personal data being sent outside the European Union, please do not send it to us.

Your rights to access your personal information

You have the right to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request you make. The current fee is £10.00.

Correcting Information/ Contacting the Website

If you wish to correct any information you have provided to us or if you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with the site, you can contact us by emailing us at irb@irb.com or writing to us at the address below.
