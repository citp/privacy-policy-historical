**Data security**

At iRobot, we take the security of our connected Robot products very seriously. Please [visit our Data Security page](http://www.irobot.com/Legal/Data-Security.aspx) to learn more about our iRobot security principles for our connected Robot products. 

**1.  HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION**

**Generally.  **We collect personal information in order to provide you with a personalized, useful and efficient experience. The categories of information we collect can include:

•  **Information you provide.  **We collect and store personal information including your name, email address, user name and password, shipping address, billing information, and phone number when you register for an iRobot account, use the iRobot Services, shop online, sign up for offers, or communicate with us. If you register your device online or through mail or another registration means, we also collect information about your Robot, such as the device ID, serial number or product code. We may also collect personal information when you send us an email, or provide us with comments, chat message and opinions on our Website or through our Service.

•  **Information we receive from third parties.  **If you login to our Website or Apps through a third party social network or authentication service, these services will authenticate your identity and may share your personal information with us (such as your name, email address, and profile information). Similarly, we may receive certain personal information if you interact with our accounts on a social network, such as by “Liking” or “Following.” The data we receive from these third party services is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service. 

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service, and to communicate directly with you, such as to send you information about your orders, product sales, special offers, and new site features.   You can control your receipt of email by visiting your Account page on our Web Site or through the App.  We may also send you Service-related emails or notifications (e.g., account verification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).  You may not be able to opt-out of Service-related e-mails.  For more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.

**Information We Collect from Registered Devices Equipped with Smart Technology.**

Some of our Robots are equipped with smart technology which allows the Robots to transmit data wirelessly to the Service.  When you register your Robot with the online App, we collect information about the Robot, such as a Robot name and device number, and information about the Robot and/or App usage, feature usage, in-App transactions, technical specifications, crashes, and other information about how you use your Robot and the product App.  For example, the Robot could collect and transmit information about the Robot’s function and use statistics, such as battery life and health, start and stop times, and number of missions.  

Certain Robot models are equipped to collect information about the environment in which the Robot is deployed. For example, the Robot collects information about its movement throughout the environment to create a location ‘map’ of the space accessible to the Robot. The spatial map is a digital representation of the Robot's domain and does not include recognizable images from the location environment. To create the map, the Robot converts computer-vision images to abstract features and landmarks to generate a spatial representation of the Robot’s territory indicating the presence of objects, obstacles, floor coverings like carpet or tile, WiFi signal strength, and dirt detection.

We use this information to collect and analyze statistics and usage data, diagnose and fix technology problems, enhance device performance, and improve user experience. We may use this information to provide you personalized communications, including marketing and promotional messages, such as emails providing product order information when your device indicates a battery needs replacement. We consider location mapping data to be sensitive, confidential information and we do not share this information with third parties for marketing purposes. Please visit our [Data Security](http://www.irobot.com/Legal/Documents/North-America/United-States/Legal-Documents/Data-Security.aspx?sc_lang=en) page to learn more. 

Our Robots do not transmit this information unless you register your device online and connect to WiFi, Bluetooth, or connect to the internet via another method.  It is possible to use our smart technology Robots without WiFi or Bluetooth data transmission, simply by disconnecting your WiFi or Bluetooth from the device or by never connecting it at all.  You can also choose through your settings in the App to not to have location mapping data transmitted to us.

**Information collected automatically.**

We and our third party service providers may collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Website or mobile Apps, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to monitor and improve our websites and services, and for other internal purposes. In some instances, we and our third party service providers may combine this usage information with personal information. If we do combine any usage information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information.

We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”). We, and our third party partners, use tracking technologies to automatically collect usage and device information, such as: 

  * **Information about your device and its software** , such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other such information. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
  * **Information about the way you access and use our Service**. For example, the website from which you came and the website to which you are going when you leave our Website, the pages you visit, the links you click, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Website from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Website.
  * **Information about your location,**  including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate or infer a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.
  * **Analytics information.**  We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Sites and to understand more about the demographics of our users. You can learn more about Google’s practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.



We use this data to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the websites; (b) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the Service; (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website and the Service; (d) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (e) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Service. We also use tracking technologies to personalize advertising. See Section 3 to learn more about our online advertising practices.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies; however, doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it. 

Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.

**2.   SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES**

We may share your personal information in the instances described below.  For further information on your choices regarding your information, see the “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” section below.

• Other companies owned by or under common ownership as iRobot, which also includes our subsidiaries (i.e., any organization we own or control) or our ultimate holding company (i.e., any organization that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns.  These companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under this Policy;

• Third parties at your request.  For example, iRobot permits third parties to develop apps and tools which interact with our Robots, including, for example, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. If you choose to utilize a third party app or service, we will permit the third party to collect information from your Robot. Please note that iRobot does not control the data collection and use practices of these third parties. You should carefully review the third party privacy policy and other documents before connecting your Robot to the third party service.  

• Other parties in connection with any company transaction, such as a merger, sale of all or a portion of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in the event of bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings; and

• Third parties as required to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena/court order, legal process or other government request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, including the investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of iRobot, its users or the public as required or permitted by law and (v) detect, prevent or otherwise address criminal (including fraud or stalking), security or technical issues.
