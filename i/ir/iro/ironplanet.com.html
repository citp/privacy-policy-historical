                  <blockquote>

                      to time, IronPlanet may email you with informative messages 
                      about our services or third party products and services 
                      we believe may be of interest to you.

                  <p><b>Who does IronPlanet share information with?<br>
                    </b>IronPlanet may share user information with specific third 
                    parties for the purpose of providing additional services. 
                    In particular, IronPlanet has several service partners who 
                    provide services or products and as part of such operations, 
                    these companies may have access to your personal information. 
                    In addition, IronPlanet also discloses aggregated user statistics 
                    in order to describe our services and reach to prospective 
                    partners, advertisers and other third parties. However aggregate 
                    data is not traceable to you specifically. Except for these

                    you with a requested service or under circumstances required 
                    by law. We will disclose your personal information when we 
                    believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation 
                    or legal process requires it, or where we believe disclosure 
                    is necessary to protect or enforce our rights. 
                  </p><p>Specific uses of personal information that vary from this 
                    Privacy Statement (if any) may be found in the User Agreement 
                    or privacy policies applicable to that particular service. 
                    To the extent that you are notified of uses of your personal 
                    information which are different from those described in this 
                    Privacy Statement during your enrollment in any particular 
                    service, contest or promotion, the uses of which you are specifically

                    the secrecy of any password you use to register and you should
