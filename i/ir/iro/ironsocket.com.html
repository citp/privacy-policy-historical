			<ul>
				<li>We pay third-party vendors, including Google, to display our advertising on sites across the Internet;</li>
				<li>We provide lists of collected IP addresses to third- party advertising platforms, including Google so that, when you visit sites within their advertising network using the same IP address, our advertising will be displayed. We DO NOT provide any personally identifiable information;</li>
				<li>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to our site; and</li>
				<li>For additional information regarding Google's use of cookies and how you can opt out, please visit Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/">Ad Settings</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			If you register on our Site, and use the Services, we collect additional limited information as explained below.<br>

				<li>We use this data to manage your account, to provide the Services, and to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
			</ul>
			c) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Upon Use of the HTTP, SOCKS5 Proxy Services</span>. In addition to information collected upon registration:<br>
			<ul>

			<h3>When We Disclose Your Information</h3>
			We may share aggregate statistical data and other forms of non-personally identifiable information with non-affiliated third parties for advertising, marketing or research purposes.<br><br>
			We MAY disclose certain limited information about you to third parties (i) in the event of a reorganization of our business, (ii) in order to fulfill the Services, (iii) as required to comply with law enforcement where subpoenas, warrants or other legal documents have been provided which are valid under Hong Kong jurisdiction, and (iv) to protect the Company. In a nutshell:<br>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Business Transfers</em>. We may disclose your information to an acquiring company if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if all or some of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding;</li>
				<li><em>Service Providers</em>. We may disclose your information to third party service providers who provide services on our behalf, such as processing payments, hosting our Site, and sending email messages for us. Our service providers receive only the information they need to perform their designated functions, and are not permitted to use or disclose this information for their own marketing or other purposes. We are not responsible for any third party payment provider handling your transaction. Please refer to the third party payment provider's privacy policy to see how they use your data;</li>
				<li><em>Legal Process</em>. The company cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies but only discloses user information when required to do so subject to subpoenas, warrants and legal processes valid under Hong Kong jurisdiction;
					<ul>
						<li>The extent of disclosure varies greatly based upon the specific Services accessed by the user, the frequency of activity by the user, and the territory of the server(s) to which the user connected;</li>
						<li>The Company cannot (by system design) disclose IP addresses of websites visited or information about applications, services and websites accessed by any users while connected to our virtual private network service because we DO NOT log or store this information; and</li>
					</ul>
				</li><li><em>To Protect IronSocket</em>. In order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to anyone's safety, or violations of our Terms or this Policy, or to exercise or defend legal claims or otherwise protect IronSocket in litigation.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
			We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies to understand how users access and use our Site. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may place cookies on your computer. For more information about cookies, please visit <a href="http://aboutcookies.org">aboutcookies.org</a>.<br><br>
			The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.<br><br>
			We use "session ID cookies" to allow our system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to your account at the Site. Session ID cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and for us to deliver the Services ordered. We may use "persistent cookies" to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity and to administrate our affiliate program. We may also use persistent cookies in areas of the Site where you are able to customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your preferences more than once.<br><br>
			By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this Site.<br><br>
			Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., third party advertisers) may use cookies on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br>
			We currently use the following:<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Google Analytics cookies:</b>  These cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site, using a service provided by Google Analytics. For more information visit: <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html;</a></li>
				<li><b>Affiliate cookies:</b> These cookies allow us to identify if you have been referred to us by an affiliate, so we can pay commission to that affiliate;</li>
				<li><b>Login cookies:</b> We use these cookies so you remain logged in when you are using your account;</li>
				<li><b>Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).</b> We or the third parties we engage may employ clear GIFs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site by among other things, tracking the activities of our Site visitors and compiling statistics about Site usage. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or within emails. We do not provide these third parties with any personal information that we have collected about you.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Security Measures</h3>
			We use security measures that are consistent with industry standards to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse or unauthorized access or disclosure or destruction:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers;</li>
				<li>We use MFA (multi-factor authentication) processes wherever appropriate;</li>
				<li>We use encryption, access controls, passwords, and physical security measures;</li>
				<li>All information is in electronic format, securely stored in our databases;</li>
				<li>All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices; and</li>
				<li>Access to user or subscriber personal information is restricted to those who need to know such information to perform their job functions. Despite our efforts, no data security methods guarantee 100% protection. We do not promise and cannot guarantee that your personal information can never be viewed and/or used by others.</li>
			</ul><br>

			Our Marketing emails and newsletters offer helpful information and may include promotional offers for our services.
