## Cookies and Other Technologies

When you interact with our websites or mobile apps, we or our authorized third-party service providers may place cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other non-cookie based technologies on your device to collect and store information that helps us track and analyze usage, provide a more efficient and personalized experience to our users, and to personalize online display advertising tailored to users' interests. This information collected by us may be associated with personal information we already have or collect from other sources for the purposes noted above under "Information Use". 

Some of these technologies may be permanently placed on your device until you choose to remove them (i.e. persistent cookies); while others are temporary and are removed after you close your browser (i.e. session cookies). You are always free to block our cookies if your browser or device permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our services' and websites' features or content. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable cookies, please review your specific browser or device settings. Please review your browser settings for further details. Please also note that you may choose to opt-out of some of these technologies as explained in "Choice/Opt Out" below. 

Our use of these technologies falls into four categories: 

  1. Operationally necessary - These technologies are used to permit access to our websites or services and use certain features such as maintaining logged-in status for your account while using a website, as well as enabling you to move around it and use its features.
  2. Functionality related - We use these technologies so we can remember your preferences while browsing websites and to provide enhanced and more personalized content and features, such as saved equipment searches. In order to permit your connection and use of our websites and services, we receive and record usage data about your device and browser (see above). If you access the website from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (where permitted in your device settings), or other transactional information for that device.
  3. Performance related - We and/or our service providers may use analytics and testing technologies to collect information about your usage and interaction with our services and websites, for instance web page views or interaction with a link or other content. We use this information to understand overall usage patterns of our visitors and determine whether certain content is effective or not. We do not permit any of these service providers to use any of your personal information collected on our websites for their own purposes.
  4. Advertising related - These technologies are used by us and our service providers to deliver advertising or personalized emails we believe are relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may use first-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including personalized ads, we believe are relevant to your interests, on our websites or on third party sites. This means that when you are on websites other than our websites, you may be shown advertising based on your activity on our websites. These technologies may also be used to help measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns. These technologies remember what you've looked at on our websites as well as, among other things, IP address, browser type, webpage visited prior to our websites, and the subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over. 

Third-party advertisers and other organizations also use their own third-party cookies or plug-ins to collect information about your activities on our websites and/or the advertisements you have clicked on. This information, which may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, may be used by them to serve advertisements on third party sites that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed. Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to track aggregate usage statistics. We do not control these third-parties' processing of your information which is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing these cookies. To learn about these cookies and to disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third party's website or "Choice/Opt Out" below.




## Security

While we take reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the information you submit or that we collect online and offline against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free. If you believe your Ritchie Bros.

If you believe your IronPlanet account has been abused, please contact us at [customercare@ironplanet.com](mailto:customercare@ironplanet.com).

## Choice / Opt-Out

You have a choice about how we use your personal information to communicate with you and how we provide relevant advertising.

**1\. Email Communications**

We use your email address to communicate with you in order to fulfill any contractual obligations with you, including those associated with your online account. In addition, where permitted by applicable law, we may send you relevant marketing communication if you have registered and created a profile through one of our websites (including rbauction.com, ironplanet.com, truckplanet.com, or govplanet.com) and agreed to our terms of use for your account. We may also send you marketing communications if you have registered to sell or bid in person at any of our live sales events and agreed to our terms at the time of registration. In certain jurisdictions, by doing so, you infer or imply your consent. If you reside in a country that requires that we obtain your express consent separately, we will ask for you to expressly opt-into communications. Marketing communications may come from the Ritchie Bros. entity that you contracted with when registering an account or registering to sell or bid, or from an affiliated Ritchie Bros. entity that provides goods or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you are receiving marketing emails, you can unsubscribe from these marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive.
