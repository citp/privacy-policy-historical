**Who does IronPlanet share information with?  
**IronPlanet may share user information with specific third parties for the purpose of providing additional services. In particular, IronPlanet has several service partners who provide services or products and as part of such operations, these companies may have access to your personal information. In addition, IronPlanet also discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services and reach to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. However aggregate data is not traceable to you specifically. Except for these situations, we will not disclose your personal information to any third parties except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service or under circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation or legal process requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights. 

Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Statement (if any) may be found in the User Agreement or privacy policies applicable to that particular service. To the extent that you are notified of uses of your personal information which are different from those described in this Privacy Statement during your enrollment in any particular service, contest or promotion, the uses of which you are specifically notified will govern that service, sweepstakes, contest or promotion. Please note, however, that we do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers and other third party sites to which we provide banner ads and links. If you click through a banner ad or link and submit your information to an advertiser, you will be subject to their own privacy policies. IronPlanet assumes no responsibility or liability for these third party policies or the actions of non-affiliated third parties. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?  
** You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online in a public area, that information may be collected and used by others. We do not control the actions of our visitors and registered users. If you disclose personal information in a publicly accessible place in the IronPlanet web site ("IronPlanet Site"), you do so at your own risk and you understand that your submitted information may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements, or for other purposes. 

Please remember that you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use to register and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online. 

Although IronPlanet uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personal information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. IronPlanet assumes no liability for disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized third parties.
