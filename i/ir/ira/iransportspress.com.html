              In order to use the ISP Discussion Forum, a user must first complete 
              the registration form.&nbsp; During registration a user is required 
              to give their contact information (such as name and email address).&nbsp; 
              This information is used to contact the user about the services

              our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When our registration/order form asks 
              users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number 
              and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and 
              is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 
              SSL.&nbsp; While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock 
              icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and 
              Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked,

              who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
              our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted 
              access to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Our employees 
              must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their 
              desk.&nbsp; When they return, they must re-enter their password 
              to re-gain access to your information.&nbsp; Furthermore, ALL employees 
              are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.&nbsp; 
              Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees 
              are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
              and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is 
              protected.&nbsp; Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable
