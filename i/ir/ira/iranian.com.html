		<h2 class="floatl">Iranian.com Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Our Privacy Policy and Use of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Iranian.com, through itself and its subsidiaries (“Iranian.com” or “we”) created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your personal information and informing you on how it is handled. This Privacy Policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage and data gathered on Iranian.com (the “Site”). It does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact between Iranian.com, or any other company, site, or consumers.  Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the Site or provide Iranian.com with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.</p>
<p>We hope that you will want to provide some information about yourself to Iranian.com by becoming a “registered user,” because it will make your experience here more valuable to you and to other members of the community. If you are comfortable sharing some basic information about yourself, you will receive enhanced services that are otherwise not possible to offer to unregistered users.</p>
<p>Regardless, this Privacy Policy applies to all “users,” whether registered or not. However you choose to interact with Iranian.com, you have our pledge that we will manage your privacy information in accordance with the policies set forth herein. Please note that we may share information about you to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>If you choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as posting blogs/comments on the site, any information you submit can be read, collected, or used by others. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in public activities or submissions.  Please also remember that Iranian.com is not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>We may share information about you in the event that the Site is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate transaction takes place. However, the Site will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our site or sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  We may also share information about you to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the Site's <a href="/index/page/name/terms" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p><strong>When you visit Iranian.com ("cookies")</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are used on the Iranian.com Web site to manage advertising banner displays by our advertising partners. Iranian.com cookies from registered users also may contain a user's username(s) so that the username is “remembered” on the computer.  We use Google Adsense and other advertising networks, and they have their own cookies, for which we are not responsible. Google uses the DoubleClick DART cookie/AdJuggler, which enables it to serve you ads based on your visits to all sites on the Internet which support that cookie. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.</p>
<p>We also gather traffic patterns and Site usage information, such as browser type, referring URL, and IP address, in order to help us develop the design and layout of the Site. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information about you.</p>
<p>We have relationships with advertisers and vendors who sell products and services to customers who click from Iranian.com to the vendor's Web site. We may use broad demographic or geographic information provided by you to target ads, but no advertiser will have access to your personally identifying information. In cases where you click through to an advertisers’ site, Iranian.com does not collect any information about you, and any information provided by you to these vendors and service providers would fall under the privacy policy of such vendor(s). These are external to the Iranian.com Web site, and therefore not under the control of Iranian.com.</p>
<p>We may also share aggregate statistical information regarding our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and Site usage with our commercial partners. For example, we may develop summary, not individual, reports for our advertisers or sponsors. An example of a summary report might be "800 people clicked on Advertisement Z today."</p>
<p>We also may use this general information in conjunction with generally available marketing databases so that we better understand our customers and can tailor our products, services and Content to meet our customers' needs and preferences. This information is for use by Iranian.com only and is not shared with third parties.</p>
