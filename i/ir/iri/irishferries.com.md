#### Security Policy

Our secure server software encrypts all of your personal information, including credit/charge card information. The process of encryption takes the information you enter and converts it into bits of code that are securely transmitted over the Internet.

This scrambled data cannot be read as the information travels over the internet. Once your encrypted personal information is received by our secure server, it is translated back into its original form.

For additional security, your credit card/charge card details are separately stored on an "off-line" server. None of our reservations staff have access to your card details so you will need to quote your credit card details should you wish to make a telephone booking.

Finally only you know the password to your account and only you can change any details stored on your account.
