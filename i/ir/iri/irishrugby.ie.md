We also ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. We will give your name and address to our couriers and we may also give them your telephone number to aid the delivery of your order.

When you register on the website or, during the process of purchasing goods from the website and choose to receive further information from us, we may use the information you provide us with for the following purposes:-

  * We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us to develop the design and layout of the website.
  * Personal details may be for purposes such as notifying you of IRFU news, events, fixture, ticket, merchandising and player information which we think may be of interest to you.
  * The IRFU will not put any information about you on general release nor will it sell such information to organisations not associated with the IRFU. Personal data will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.

## Cookies

EU Cookie directive

From 26 May 2011 a new European Union directive requires us to gain the consent of our users to download cookies on to their machines. There are various methods we could use to gain users consent. For example, we could use pop-ups; prompting users to tick a box to confirm they give permission for us to download cookies on their machine.

Alternatively, we could use an online form that all users must complete before using the website.

We consider both of these solutions as obtrusive. We want our users find information and services quickly.

Therefore, we have taken the decision to promote how we use cookies on our website instead. This will enable users to make an informed decision whether they want to disable this feature.  
There are links on our terms and conditions and disclaimer pages which are in the footer of every web page pointing to this information.
