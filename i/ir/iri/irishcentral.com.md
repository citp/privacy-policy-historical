This Privacy Statement only applies to information collected on the website. For example, this privacy statement does not apply to information you may have provided when entering a sweepstakes by mail, fax, or email.

This privacy policy may be modified at any time; the date of the most recent revision will appear on this page and although we will do our best to keep you updated, please do check back periodically.

**II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**_Our primary goal in collecting information is to enhance your user experience on our Website._** __

A. Personally identifying information

We do not automatically collect any personally identifying information from visitors to the website.

To take advantage of certain optional features or functions of the website, you may be asked to voluntarily supply certain personally identifying information such as your name, address, email address and telephone number. For example, you may be asked to supply personally identifying information if you complete the optional registration process for the website or if you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, or link an account through a social network.

We work with social networks including, but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and LinkedIn. We have access to information you directly provide and information through those social networking services based on your privacy settings on those networks.

Personally identifying information may be shared with third parties as disclosed in this privacy policy or at the time you provide your information. Third parties that provide support for the operation of the website or features thereof may also have access to such information. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings or performing statistical analysis of our website. We may also share personally identifying information we have about our users with third parties so that the third parties can send you information and special offers, unless you choose to opt out from such sharing by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in such emails.

If you do not want any of your personally identifying information collected, you can always decline to take advantage of these optional features and functions. After creating a profile on irishcentral.com, if you wish to change any of your profile information, you may do so by clicking the "My Profile" link when you are logged in and then edit your contact information. Furthermore, if you wish to review your personal data that we have gathered, you may contact us at any time to let us know and we will e-mail such data free of charge in electronic format.

B. Tracking information

1. **Cookies** : Like many website operators, we use “cookies” to recognize your web browser.  A “cookie” is a small piece of information that is stored in a designated file on your computer.  Each cookie has a unique number with no meaning outside of the website. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information about our visitors.

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  Session ID cookies terminate when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be stored on a hard drive for an extended period.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following the directions found under “Help” in your internet browser.  You can configure your browser not to accept cookies. However, please keep in mind that if you do so, you may not be able to use certain optional features or functions of the website. Separately, third party companies that serve advertisements on the website may use cookies and other tracking information, as further detailed below, to collect information about your visits to this website and other websites.

2\. **Log Files** : Like many website operators, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, and number of clicks. The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to personally identifying information.

3\. **Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs):** Advertisements that appear on our website are sometimes delivered by third party advertisers. These third-party advertisers may use web beacons or web bugs to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.  No personally identifying information is gathered through web beacons or web bugs.

C. E-mail Addresses

1\. **When do we collect your email address?:** We do not automatically collect your email address.  We obtain your email address only if you choose to provide it to us when you complete the optional registration process on our website or when you participate in one of our online offers.

2. **How do we use your email address?:** If you choose to provide us with your email address, we may email you from time to time to call your attention to products and offers we believe might interest you.

3. **Can you opt out of receiving emails?:** If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by us, our advertisers or other third parties, you will be given an opportunity to decline at the time you provide any information.

If you decline at the time you provide us with information or choose to opt out later, you will not receive email or other communications sent directly by us or our advertisers utilizing information collected from our site. However, if you provide your personal information in order to enter one of our sweepstakes, contests, or online offers, you may still receive information about the specific sweepstakes, contest, or online offer you entered.

4. **How to opt out of emails** : You can opt out of receiving emails at the time you provide your information or at any other time. When you submit personally identifying information, if the information might be used for emailing purposes, then you will be given the opportunity, at the time of submission, to decline to receive such communications.  You can also choose to opt out later by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button included on the bottom of every email you receive from us.  You may also pick and choose which newsletters you wish to receive by clicking the “Change Newsletter Preferences” button included on the bottom of every email you receive from us.

**III. HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**

A. Purposes for Which Information Is Submitted

Personally identifying information that you voluntarily submit may be used for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. For example, if you voluntarily submit personally identifying information to enter a sweepstakes on the website, the information that you submit may be used as part of your entry to that sweepstakes.

Personally identifying information may be shared with third-parties to the extent necessary to accomplish the purpose(s) for which the information was submitted. 

B. Facilitating Use of the Website and Customizing Content, Advertising and Offers

We may use information collected from cookies and other tracking technology to recognize your browser when you visit the Website and to facilitate login to the Website, to attempt to personalize the Website for each user, to ensure that your browser does or does not keep seeing the same ads, to sequence ads and offers in a series and to track page usage and paths.  We may also use collected information to allow editorial content and/or advertising on the Website to be targeted to groups of users for whom it is most pertinent. This means that users see editorial content and/or advertising most likely to interest them. In connection with these uses, we may disclose information to third parties, but only in aggregate form.

We also use third party companies to serve advertisements on the Website. These companies may use cookies and other tracking information to collect information about your visits to the Website and other websites, so that they can measure the effectiveness of ads, to track page usage and paths followed during visits, and to provide advertisements about goods and services they think will be of interest to you based on your usage.

If you voluntarily supply personally identifiable information that includes contact information, we may, from time to time, contact you or give your contact information to third parties so that they may contact you, to call your attention to products or services that may be of interest to you.  When you submit personally identifying information, if the information might be used for this purpose, then you will be given the opportunity, at the time of submission, to decline to receive such communications by checking an “opt in” or “opt out” box.  If you decline at that time, or if you chose to opt out later, you will not receive such communications utilizing information collected from the Website.  You can choose to opt out later by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button included on the bottom of every email you receive from us.
