<h2><a name="info"></a>Information we collect</h2>

<div class="dotrule"></div>


<p><strong><em>Non-Personal (Aggregated) Information </em></strong></p>

<p>IrishJobs.ie gathers information on all users of our site on an aggregated basis. This information is used to analyse what the total usage levels are for the site, what areas of the site are most popular and what times of the day are most popular for using the site. This information is used to determine what improvements we can make going forward. In addition, we may share this information with our clients or potential clients and our partners, but only on an aggregated basis with no individual breakdown, so they receive no information about how you, as an individual, use the site, nor will they be able to identify you personally from the information they receive. </p>
			  
<p><strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong></p>

<p>There are areas of the IrishJobs.ie website where you can request information, subscribe to marketing materials, enter competitions, register yourself for our online services, request customer support or apply for a job within our organisation. This can involve registering your personal information such as; your name, e-mail address, password, contact details, educational and employment background, and job interest information. The information collected is solely for the purpose of personalising your user experience and for delivering the service(s) that you have signed up for. Once you choose to provide IrishJobs.ie with personal information, you can be certain that it will only be used to support your relationship with us.</p>
			  
<p><strong><em>Automatically Logged Information</em></strong></p>

<p>IrishJobs.ie uses your IP address, log user agents and referring address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site and to identify unique users.</p>    
          
<p>We <strong>will not</strong> monitor, edit, or disclose any personal information about you or your internet usage without your prior permission unless we believe that such action is required to enforce the law. In this case, data may be passed on to appropriate individuals, organisations or companies, if specifically requested.</p>

<h2><a name="services"></a>IrishJobs.ie Services</h2>

<div class="dotrule"></div>


<p><em><strong>Application Information</strong></em></p>

<p>IrishJobs.ie operates as a platform for jobseekers and recruiters to come together on the internet. As such we are not involved in matching or placing jobseekers, rather we provide you with the tools to enable you to choose the companies and recruitment agencies you would like to speak to when you wish to do so.</p>

<p>When you make an online application on IrishJobs.ie your personal information / CV application is received <strong>directly </strong> by the recruiter. By forwarding your information to that recruiter for the vacancy advertised IrishJobs.ie understands that it is your decision to disclose this information to a third party and acknowledge that the third party is <strong>not </strong> covered by the IrishJobs.ie Privacy Policy.</p>
              

<div class="dotrule"></div>

<p><em><strong>Client Profiles</strong></em></p>

<p>IrishJobs.ie vacancy advertising clients are given the option to have a profile page on site. This includes information related to their company such as; company logo, contact details, company profile, web address and related links. This information is disclosed for your convenience and information, however if you access some of the links and web addresses disclosed on these pages, you will leave the IrishJobs.ie website. </p>

<p>Some IrishJobs.ie clients are advertised on site under featured employer member pages; which means IrishJobs.ie host a number of their web pages on our server to provide users with an experience similar to the recruiter's own website. </p>
			  

<p>For example: <a href="/clients/featured_employer.asp?URL=pinewood/index.asp?Title=Pinewood">Pinewood</a>. There are featured links on these member pages, which when accessed you will leave the IrishJobs.ie domain. </p>
              


<div class="dotrule"></div>


<p><em><strong>My Career Manager</strong></em></p>

<p>My Career Manager is a facility on IrishJobs.ie for jobseekers to set up their individual job search requirements (job alerts) and register their CV online;</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Job Alerts <br>
                  </strong>The Job Alert service matches a jobseeker's requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on our site. For jobseekers who subscribe to this service, you receive an email listing of those jobs which match the criteria you have registered. Vacancies that match this criterion by 50% or more are sent in the form of a job alert. You decide how often you wish to receive these alerts and can change your search criteria at any time. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
<p><strong>CVs </strong>
<br>Jobseekers may decide to register their CV in our database, through My Career Manager. Users can choose to make their CV searchable for inclusion in our CV database product. This product allows your CV to be viewed by recruiters who have subscribed to this service. It also means that you can attach your CV to your online job application(s).</p>

<p>To store your CV in the database you <strong>must </strong> remove confidential details such as your contact information and references. Recruiters will contact you via IrishJobs.ie if they have a position that matches your experience and requirements. They will provide their company name, contact details and a job description enabling you to follow up with them <strong>directly </strong>. We endeavour to grant access to the CV database only to recruiters who agree to abide by our Terms and Conditions. However, should a third party gain access to your CV by evading our security measures, we cannot be held responsible.</p>

<p>You may remove your CV from our database at any time. However, recruiters who have already accessed your CV may have kept a copy of it in their own files. Please note that we cannot be held responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV in these instances.</p>

<p>In the interest of your privacy and the maintenance of an up-to-date CV database, CVs are removed from recruiters' access if they have not been updated for a period of 12 months. If you wish your CV to remain in the searchable database, you must update your details at least once every 12 months. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Career Update Service <br>
                    </strong>The Career Update service within My Career Manager offers users the ability to register their personal details to receive a monthly email detailing career information and site service information. <br>
                    <br>
                    If, at any time, you do not wish to remain a registered user of any of the above facilities within My Career Manager, you can unsubscribe and/or delete your personal information from our databases. 
  IrishJobs.ie also offers you the ability to change at any time the personal information you give during registration. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>  
				            

<div class="dotrule"></div>


<p><em><strong>Marketing</strong></em></p>

<p>To provide the best user experience IrishJobs.ie may invite you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional.</p>
