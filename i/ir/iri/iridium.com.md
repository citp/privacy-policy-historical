### Our Commitment to Privacy

Iridium Satellite LLC (“Iridium,” “we,” or “us”) understands that privacy is important to you and values your trust. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how we handle and protect online information about you. By using this website or any of the Iridium Apps (the “Site”) or the services provided through this Site (the “Services”), we may collect information about you, and use and disclose such information as described in this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Site or Services indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Most areas of the Site are intended for consumers. One area of the Site – Iridium for Partners – is restricted to use by our Service Partners. This Privacy Policy describes Iridium’s collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information and Anonymous Information (each as defined below) in both the consumer areas of the Site and within Iridium for Partners. “Personal Information” means your personal data or personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, job title, job industry, company/organization name, and any other information you voluntarily provide or any other non-public information that we associate with your contact information and that can identify you as an individual. “Anonymous Information” means information that we do not link to Personal Information and does not enable contact with any identifiable person. This Privacy Policy applies to Iridium’s handling of Personal Information and Anonymous Information collected via this Site and not to data obtained from other sources. For Iridium’s processing of personal data from users of Iridium’s services contracted from a third party of the European Union, please see our [Iridium Service Provider GDPR Privacy Notice](https://www.iridium.com/iridium-service-provider-gdpr-privacy-notice/).

### Anonymous Information Collected Via Technology

When you use the Site or Services, we collect certain Anonymous Information, such as your Internet protocol address, browser type, operating system and host domain. We may also use cookies or similar technology and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to automatically gather statistical data that helps us improve our Site and deliver a better and more personalized service.

### The Ways We Use Information

We use Personal Information that you submit to us for a variety of business purposes, such as when use is necessary to entering into or to perform a contract with you (i.e. deliver and manage Iridium for Partners for our Service Partners, administer your Iridium for Partners account or provide you with our Services), complying with a legal obligation (i.e. provide our investors with required information about us), or when there is a legitimate interest pursued by us or a third party (to the extent it does not infringe on any data subject’s fundamental rights and freedoms). Use of your Personal Information under a legitimate interest include to respond to your requests, provide you with technical or sales support, notify you about changes to our Services or our Site, improve the quality of the Site and Services, ensure compliance with applicable law, or manage our everyday business needs, such as auditing, administration of our services, analytics, and the enforcement of any corporate reporting obligations, [Terms of Use](https://www.iridium.com/terms-of-use/), or other policies.

Pursuant to valid consent provided by you, we may communicate with you to provide information that may be useful or interesting to you. Such information may include newsletters/press releases and marketing communications, including contest entries and surveys. You can opt out of receiving newsletters/press releases from Iridium by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email. If you are a user of Iridium for Partners and receive marketing emails from us, you can opt out of receiving future marketing messages by modifying the relevant setting in your profile. Please note that to the extent you are using other Service(s) or are a Service Partner, even if you unsubscribe or opt-out to marketing emails, you may still receive transactional, relationship or service related emails (e.g., emails related to your transmission of satellite messages).

We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information by removing information that makes the information personally identifiable to you (such as your name or email address). We may use these records, and other Anonymous Information, to analyze usage patterns in order to enhance the Site and Services, and tailor them to your preferences.  
 

### The Ways We Disclose Information

We may disclose Personal Information or Anonymous Information:

  * To contractors, third party vendors, and other third parties who help us make the Site or Services available or who support our business;
  * To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information, including those to whom you send a satellite message;
  * To certain Service Partners so they may approve your access to their proprietary information available on Iridium for Partners or for other business purposes;
  * To our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively, “Affiliates”);
  * To a company that merges with, acquires, or purchases the assets of Iridium, in which case such company may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; or
  * If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use; (b) comply with applicable laws or respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials; or (c) protect or defend the rights or property of Iridium, you, or third parties.

Your Personal Information is necessary in order for us to send you newsletters or other communications or to provide you access to Iridium for Partners.

### Retention of Personal Information
