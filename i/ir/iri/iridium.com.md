# Iridium | Privacy Policy

### Our Commitment to Privacy

Iridium Satellite LLC (“Iridium,” “we,” or “us”) understands that privacy is important to you and values your trust. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how we handle and protect online information about you. By using this website (the “Site”) or the services provided through this Site (the “Services”), we may collect information about you, and use and disclose such information as described in this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Site or Services indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Most areas of the Site are intended for consumers. One area of the Site – _Iridium for Partners_ – is restricted to use by our service partners. This Privacy Policy describes Iridium’s collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information and Anonymous Information (each as defined below) in both the consumer areas of the Site and within _Iridium for Partners_. “Personal Information” means your contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that we associate with your contact information. “Anonymous Information” means information that we do not link to Personal Information and does not enable contact with any identifiable person. This Privacy Policy applies to Iridium’s handling of Personal Information and Anonymous Information collected via this Website and not to data obtained from other sources. 

THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE HOSTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE OR SERVICES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, WHICH IS GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW, THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND OUR TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES, AND YOU CONSENT TO THAT TRANSFER. ADDITIONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE DIFFERENT OR LESS STRINGENT THAN IN YOUR HOME JURISDICTION.

### Children’s Information 

This Site is intended for adult use only. We do not direct any part of our Site to children less than 18 years old, nor do we knowingly collect Personal Information from children.

### We Collect Personal Information

In the consumer areas of the Site, we collect Personal Information when you knowingly provide it to us. In order to use, access, or receive certain Services, you may be required to complete the applicable registration form accessible on the Site. For example, to receive a newsletter, you must provide your name and email address. To send a satellite message, you will be required to provide the number to which you are sending the message, your email address and a message. In addition, we collect Personal Information when you participate in surveys and/or sweepstakes, or when you correspond with us.

To gain access to _Iridium for Partners_ , you will be required to provide certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, citizenship and the service partner with which you are affiliated (the “Service Partner”). In order to expedite your registration, and for verification purposes, it is possible that we may obtain certain Personal Information about you from the Service Partner, such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and/or citizenship. Iridium collects the information you provide via _Iridium for Partners_ , including information you provide on behalf of a service partner. 

### Anonymous Information Collected Via Technology

When you use the Site or Services, we collect certain Anonymous Information, such as your Internet protocol address, browser type and access times. We may also use cookies or similar technology and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and other Site usage data. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing it. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them). We use such Anonymous Information for a variety of business purposes, including improving our Site and Services and tailoring them to your preferences. Although you can block cookies and similar technology, your experience of the Site and Services could be affected by doing so. 

### The Ways We Use Information

We use Personal Information that you submit to us for a variety of business purposes, including to administer your account, deliver and manage _Iridium for Partners_ for our service partners, communicate with you, respond to your requests, provide Services, improve the quality of the Site and Services, ensure compliance with applicable law, and provide you with information that may be useful or interesting to you. Such information may include newsletters and marketing communications, including contest entries and surveys. You can opt out of receiving newsletters from Iridium by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of a newsletter email. If you are a user of _Iridium for Partners_ and receive marketing emails from us, you can opt out of receiving future marketing messages by modifying the relevant setting in your profile. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you transactional, relationship or service related emails (e.g., emails related to your transmission of satellite messages).

We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information by removing information that makes the information personally identifiable to you (such as your name or email address). We may use these records, and other Anonymous Information, to analyze usage patterns in order to enhance the Site or Services or for other business purposes. 

### The Ways We Disclose Information

We may disclose Personal Information or Anonymous Information:

  * To third party vendors who help us make the Site or Services available or who support our business; 
  * To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information, including those to whom you send a satellite message;
  * To certain Service Partners so they may approve your access to their proprietary information available on _Iridium for Partners_ or for other business purposes; 
  * To our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively, “Affiliates”); To a company that merges with, acquires, or purchases the assets of Iridium, in which case such company may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; or
  * If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our terms of use; (b) comply with applicable laws or respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials; or (c) protect or defend the rights or property of Iridium, you, or third parties.
