## Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Ireland.com has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices of Ireland.com.

You can access our site and utilise a number of our services without providing any information at all. However, anyone who registers for Ireland.com services provides basic contact and demographic information. We do develop general - not specific to any individual - reports for our advertisers. The people that make it possible for visitors to use Ireland.com for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. Ireland.com will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party without your express permission except where applicable for the purpose of supplying the service for which you have registered.

We do not follow your browsing path outside of our websites.
