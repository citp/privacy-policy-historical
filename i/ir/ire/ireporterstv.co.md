We will investigate any such actions with a view to prosecuting and or taking civil proceedings to recover damages against those responsible.

Confidential Information does not include information that you already knew prior to your use of the Services, that becomes public through no fault of yours, that was independently developed by you, or that was lawfully given to you by a third party. 

Client records are regarded as confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party, unless legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities. Clients have the right to request sight of, and copies of any and all Client records we keep, on the proviso that we are given reasonable notice of such a request. Clients are requested to retain copies of any literature issued in relation to the provision of our services. Where appropriate, we shall issue Client’ with appropriate written information, handouts or copies of records as part of an agreed contract, for the benefit of both parties.

_Your Account_

In order to access some features of the Website or other elements of the Service, you will have to create an account. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. It is important that you must keep your account password secure and confidential. You must notify ireporterstv.com immediately of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your account that you become aware of.

You will be asked to choose a user ID and password which you will use to obtain access to your accounts through the Services. Your user ID and password must not contain any spaces, special characters (i.e. *, &, and :), and must not have consecutive repeating characters in excess of 2 (i.e. AAA, or 111). In addition, we may ask you to create and provide responses to authentication questions that only you and the Company will know that may be used to verify your identity (together with your user ID and password, collectively referred to herein as “Access Information”). We may, at our option, change the parameters for the Access Information used to access the Services without prior notice to you. If we do so, you will be required to change your Access Information the next time you access the Services.

You are solely responsible for keeping your Access Information confidential and agree not to give or make it available to any person who is not authorized to access your accounts. You agree that the Company is authorized to provide information to any party, and act upon all instructions received using your Access Information. You further agree that use of your Access Information will have the same legal effect as your written signature authorizing the transaction. If someone to whom you have granted authority to use your Access Information exceeds such authority, you, and not the Company, shall be fully liable for all transactions initiated by such individual.

If you believe the security of your Access Information has been compromised in any way, you must notify us immediately. We reserve the right, under certain circumstances, to deny you access to any one or more account(s), the Services or any part thereof, or to deny the processing of transactions if we reasonably believe your Access Information has been compromised in any way or is being used, or might be used, by any unauthorized person(s).
