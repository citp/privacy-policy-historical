### Customer Surveys

IRS conducts surveys by telephone, by mail and online to capture taxpayer and tax practitioner opinions and suggestions for improving our products and services. The surveys are voluntary and if you choose to participate, you and your answers remain anonymous. IRS conducts its surveys using contractors who have passed a rigid security screening process to maintain your confidentiality.

It is important to remember that an IRS survey will never ask you for personal information like your Social Security Number, your Taxpayer Identification Number or any credit card or bank information. An IRS survey may ask you specific questions about your tax filing experiences, for example: _Did you file a Form 1040 with a Schedule C?;_   _Did you receive a notice regarding your taxes?;_ or, _What is your level of satisfaction with certain IRS services?_ If you receive a survey that requests personal information, do not participate, it could be [an attempt to steal your identity](https://web.archive.org/newsroom/article/0,,id=155682,00.html).

All printed IRS surveys you receive in the mail will provide an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) number. IRS surveys conducted by telephone and online will provide an IRS contact person if you wish to verify the authenticity of the survey.
