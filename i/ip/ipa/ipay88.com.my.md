**  
Use of Cookies**

  
The Website uses "cookies" to identify a user's session on the Website and thereby offers continuity as the member moves around the site.  Cookies are only used on the Website to store non-critical data.  Cookies are pieces of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.

Cookies allow websites to maintain user information across connections.  They are small strings of characters used by many websites to deliver data to your computer, and in certain circumstances, return the information to the website.  Cookies contain only information that members volunteer, and they do not have the capability of infiltrating a user's hard drive and stealing personal information.  The simple function of a cookie is that of helping the user navigate a website with as little obstruction as possible.

**  
Third-Party Links**

  
In an attempt to provide increased value to our users, iPay88 may link to sites operated by third parties.  However, even if the third party is affiliated with iPay88, iPay88 has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of iPay88.  These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk.

**  
Notification of Changes**

  
If iPay88 decides to change our privacy policy, iPay88 will post those changes on its website so the users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If, at any point, iPay88 decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, iPay88 will notify users by way of an e-mail.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  iPay88 will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
