			<p class="stdfont">Updated: <strong>May 20, 2005</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont">Please read this agreement carefully and completely before using 
				this site.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont"><em>IPAddressGuide.com</em> (the “<em>IAG</em>”) is committed to 
				protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains data collection and 
				use practices of the <em>IPAddressGuide.com</em> site (the “Site”). By 
				accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use 
				practices described in this privacy statement.</p>
			<p class="stdfont"><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong>
				<br>
				When you visit and navigate the Site and when you communicate with us via the 
				Site, we will not collect personal information about you unless you provide us 
				that information voluntarily. Any non-public personal information that you may 
				provide via our sites will be used solely for the purpose stated on the page 
				where it is collected. <em>IPAddressGuide.com</em> will not sell, license, 
				transmit or disclose this information outside of <em>IAG</em> and its 
				affiliated companies unless
				<br>
				(a) expressly authorized by you, or
				<br>
				(b) necessary to enable contractors or agents to perform certain functions as 
				requested by you, or
				<br>
				(c) required or permitted by law.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont"><strong>Use of Visitor IP Address</strong>
				<br>
				An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
				whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider. We collect IP 
				addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our 
				site. Each time you log onto our site and each time you request one of our 
				pages, our server logs your IP address. Although we log your session with us, 
				we will not normally link your IP address to anything that can enable us to 
				identify you. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when 
				we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of 
				service or to protect our service, site, users or others.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont"><strong>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
				<br>
				<em>IPAddressGuide.com</em> may contains cookies on this Site to ensure the 
				integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is 
				a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. 
				Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
				Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in 
				the domain that issued the cookie to you.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a 
				convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web 
				page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your 
				specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of 
				delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return 
				to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so 
				you can easily use the site's features that you customized.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont">Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, 
				may be used to assist in delivering the cookie on our site. This technology is 
				a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about Microsoft.com Web site 
				usage, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or 
				graphics) on a Microsoft.com Web page, blog or a newsletter. We may share 
				aggregated site statistics with partner companies.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont">Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service 
				providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or 
				email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers 
				to place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service 
				provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails 
				and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views. <em>IPAddressGuide.com</em>
				prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal 
				information.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web 
				browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
				setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you 
				may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other 
				Web sites you visit.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont"><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong>
				<br>
				We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also 
				revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For 
				material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by 
				placing a prominent notice on the home page of our Web site or by directly 
				sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this 
				privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the 
				personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes 
				your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
			</p>
			<p class="stdfont"><strong>Contact Information</strong>
				<br>
				<em>IPAddressGuide.com</em> welcomes your comments regarding this privacy 
				statement. If you believe that <em>IPAddressGuide.com</em> has not adhered to 
				this privacy statement, please contact us electronically at the email address 
				provided below, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly 
				determine and remedy the problem.
