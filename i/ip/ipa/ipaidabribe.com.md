    * Website Use Information

Similar to other websites, this website utilizes a standard technology called 'cookies' and server logs and may collect information about how the website is used by you.

A cookie is a very small text document which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer seeks certain electronic, automated permissions from your computer, to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it.

Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, the time spent on our website, and the websites visited just before and just after the website.

As you use the website, the website uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users so your preferences are unique to you. In some cases, the website also uses cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our server log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and parts of the website which are most popular with our users. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve the website and our services. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provide to us, in your cookies.

Please note that, to protect your privacy, your browser will only permit a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. This means, neither can our website access cookies sent to you by other websites, nor can other websites access or recognize cookies sent by our website to your computer.

  * SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES:

In all the above instances, you may be required to share your name and contact details. Please note that a validation email will be sent to your email address, for your confirmation, before we undertake any action on the request submitted by you, in this regard.

Your trust is important to us, which is why we do not share information we have received about you unless (i) we have received your permission, given your notice such as by telling you about it in this policy; or (ii) have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from any content posted by you. We provide your information to third parties only after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that the resultant data is no longer associated with you.
