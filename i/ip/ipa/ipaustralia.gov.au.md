**Please note that this notice should be read in detail before using this site.**

IP Australia is concerned about protecting your privacy. This policy sets out how we handle clickstream data, cookies and e-mail addresses. 

## Clickstream data

Clickstreams are the paths a user takes when navigating a web page or the internet in general.

When you visit IP Australia our Internet Service Provider makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes - the user's server address, the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc), the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited, and the type of browser used.

IP Australia examines this information to determine the traffic through the server as well as access levels to specific pages. In order to deliver better services, IP Australia also performs statistical analysis to establish priorities and allocate resources. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs. The statistics and log files may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time an in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the information supplied by IP Australia.

## Cookies

A cookie is a short piece of data which is sent from a web server to a web browser on the user's machine when the browser visits the server's site. The cookie is stored on the user's machine, but it is not an executable program and cannot do anything to your machine.

Whenever a web browser requests a file from the same web server that sent the cookie, the browser sends a copy of that cookie back to the server along with the request. In this way, the server knows you have visited before and can co-ordinate your access to different pages on its web site. A server cannot find out a name or e-mail address, or anything about a user's computer, by using cookies.

IP Australia uses cookies to obtain session details for access to parts of our sites. Cookies are essential in providing a seamless access to our on-line databases. Cookie information is not stored or collected by IP Australia. IP Australia does not maintain a record of enquiries to the database search engines, or the results obtained by the search request.
