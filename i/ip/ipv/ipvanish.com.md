# Privacy Policy - IPVanish VPN

Your privacy is our priority, but your trust in us is equally important. **That's why we want to be as transparent as possible in our policies.** IPVanish is a zero-logs VPN service provider, which means that we do not keep a record of any connection, traffic, or activity data in regards to our Services. In general, however, we monitor our Site activity to measure its performance and improve functionality. We want you to understand the type of information we collect, why we collect that data, and exactly how we use the information we collect.

### In Brief

  * We care deeply about your privacy rights, and we will never log any traffic or usage of our VPN.
  * We do not sell or rent personal information to others, under any circumstance.
  * Your data is secured and rendered anonymous whenever you are connected to our Services.
  * In order to provide you with our Services, we need to collect an email address and payment method to process transactions.

### _Site_

We aggregate information from Site visitors using cookies, pixels, and similar technologies, such as Google Analytics. In such cases of automated collection, the focus of this data collection is on our Site performance, not on your personal information. You can browse our Site without submitting any personal information. The only non-personal data we collect from all visitors is in order to improve our Site. This information is aggregated, offering a high-level view of our Site activity, including:

You may also need to provide additional personal information such as your name, street address, city, state, country, and billing zip code, depending on your chosen payment method. We will only use this information to collect and process payments for you. Once you have created an account, this personal information can be modified by you at any time through your [Account Control Panel](http://account.ipvanish.com/).

### _Website Cookies_

Cookies collect information about the use of our Site, and provide users with basic functionality; such as allowing you to save your account credentials to your browser. The cookies used for our Site are not connected to our Services in any way and cannot be tied to your Service activity.

We use third-party service providers to aggregate non-personally identifiable Site data. These third parties, such as Google Analytics, use cookies and tracking pixels placed on our Site to collect, analyze, and generate reports on Site usage for us. The collection and processing of data from our Site by third-party service providers is consistent with this Policy. We do not provide these third parties with personal information about any specific user.

### Opt-Out for All Website Cookies

Many web browsers accept cookies automatically. There are many resources that advise you on adjusting cookie settings, such as [About Cookies](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). You can block cookies any time by adjusting your browser settings, visiting the Network Advertising Initiative [opt-out page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/), or by disabling specific third-party pixels (see below).

We use industry best security measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access. All of our employees are kept up-to-date on these best practices. In addition, we restrict employee access to service administrative panels to only those who require such access in order to perform their job functions.
