    <h3 class="firstH3">1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <h4>1.1	The Company</h4>
    <p>IPic - Gold Class Entertainment ("IGCE") operates Cinemas in the US and through the operation of these cinemas, IGCE from time to time gathers information from Customers and other parties with whom we deal, for a variety of reasons including, in particular, to enable us to improve the nature of the services we provide. IGCE understands individuals' concerns regarding confidentiality and takes seriously its obligations with respect to all information it gathers. This Privacy Policy outlines how IGCE deals with Personal Information. </p>
    <h4>1.2	Internet Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>It is IGCE's policy to fully comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws. This IGCE Internet Privacy Policy ("Policy") sets forth the steps IGCE takes in protecting the privacy of personal information obtained on our Internet sites. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies, in general, to all internet sites operated by or on behalf of IGCE and its subsidiaries ("IGCE Internet Sites"). </p>
    <h4>1.3	Web Site Privacy Statements</h4>
    <p>Although this Policy applies to all IGCE Internet Sites generally, each IGCE Internet site has a different purpose and different features. If additional or different disclosures are required with respect to a specific IGCE Internet site, we will provide those disclosures on that site itself or in a separate web site privacy statement ("Web Site Privacy Statement") posted on that site. Each individual disclosure or Web Site Privacy Statement supplements and amends this Policy, but only with respect to the IGCE Internet Site on which it is posted. </p>
    <h4>1.4	Links to Third Party Internet Sites</h4>
    <p>IGCE Internet sites may contain links to Internet sites that are not operated by IGCE. These links are provided as a service and do not imply any endorsement of the activities or content of these sites, nor any association with their operators. IGCE does not control these Internet sites and is not responsible for their content, security, or privacy practices. We urge you to review the privacy policy posted on web sites you visit before using the site or providing personal information. </p>
    <h3>2. WHY IGCE COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <h4>2.1	Nature of Information</h4>
    <p>The information IGCE collects in most cases relates to Customers but can relate to suppliers and other parties we deal with (for the purposes of this Privacy Policy all such people are described as ("Customers"). Information is gathered for a range of purposes, including the provision of ongoing Customer support and the compiling of Customer databases to enable us to more accurately market our goods and services. The type of information we collect may include such things as contact details (name, physical and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc. ), demographic information (such as zip code, age or income level), financial information (such as account or credit card numbers), buying habits, opinions, product preferences and transactional details. We may also collect the Internet Protocol address and e-mail address of visitors to our website, the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to a bulletin board (if applicable), and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. IGCE treats all information which is collected and identifiable as relating to an individual as Personal Information. It is this information which is described as "Personal Information" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>In addition to Personal Information, our web servers automatically collect website usage information from Customers when they visit our website. Website usage information is anonymous information about our visitors that describes how our website is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each web page, their actions taken during visits to the site, and the length of their stays. Website usage information does not contain personally identifiable information. </p>
    <h4>2.2	Collection of Information</h4>
    <p>Where practical, Customers of IGCE may deal with IGCE on an anonymous basis. However, as a provider of a wide range of services, IGCE frequently finds that it is necessary or desirable to collect Personal Information during the course of transactions. Personal Information may be collected about Customers via the following means:</p>
    <h4>2.2.1. Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. </h4>
    <p>IGCE collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Macintosh® or Windows®) and the name and version of your browser (such as Internet Explorer® or Netscape®). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. </p>
    <p>The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this information to create statistics that help us improve our sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our Internet visitors. </p>
    <h4>2.2.2. Information Collected By Placing a "Cookie" On Your Computer</h4>
    <p>IGCE may obtain information about you by installing a "tag" on your computer's hard drive. This tag is known as a "cookie. "<br>
      All of our IGCE Internet sites use "session cookies. "  A session cookie is used to tag your computer with a computer-generated, unique identifier when you access our site. A session cookie does not identify you personally and expires after you close your browser. We use session cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "clickstream data") in statistical form to better understand our visitors' interests and needs to improve the content and functionality of our sites. <br>
      Some IGCE Internet sites also use "persistent cookies. " These cookies do not expire when you close your browser; they stay on your computer until you delete them. By assigning your computer a unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences, and in situations where these choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be provided by us automatically, saving you time and effort. For example, after you make a purchase, if you decide to make another purchase, your shipping address will have  been retained and will only need to be confirmed. If an IGCE Internet Site uses "persistent cookies" we will notify you in the Privacy Statement posted on that site. <br>
    If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit an IGCE Internet Site, you may be unable to use all of the features of the Site if your browser rejects our cookies. </p>
    <h4>2.2.3. Information You Knowingly and Voluntarily Provide</h4>
    <p>IGCE collects the information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use an IGCE Internet site, for example, the information you provide when you sign up to receive email alerts, when you complete a survey, when you become a member, or when you ask us a question or email us with feedback. In many cases this information will be Personal Information. </p>
    <p>IGCE uses this information for the purposes for which you provide it. For example, if you provide your e-mail address when you sign up to receive e-mail alerts, we use your e-mail address to deliver the e-mail alerts you request. <br>
      We may also use the information we collect on IGCE Internet Sites for various business purposes such as customer service, fraud prevention, market research, improving our products and services, and providing you with information and offers we believe may be of interest to you. We may also remove all the personally identifiable information and use the rest for historical, statistical or scientific purposes. </p>
    <h4>2.2.4. Ownership of Information Collected on the IGCE Internet Sites. </h4>
    <p>All Personal Information collected on IGCE Internet Sites will remain the property of IGCE. </p>
    <h4>2.3	'Sensitive Information'</h4>
    <p>IGCE will not ask a Customer for information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, or details of health, disability or sexual orientation, unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) the Customer provides their consent;</li>
      <li>(b) the collection of that information is specifically authorized by law;</li>
      <li>(c) the collection is necessary to lessen a serious or imminent threat to the health or safety of a person; or</li>
      <li>(d) the collection of the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2.4	Customer Consent</h4>
    <p>IGCE will interpret a Customer's actions as indicating that a Customer consents to the collection of Personal Information. This may occur where the Customer has provided Personal Information for a particular purpose and that purpose cannot be achieved without IGCE making use of the Customer's Personal Information. </p>
    <h4>2.5	What happens if Personal Information is not provided</h4>
    <p>Where relevant, IGCE will endeavor to make Customers aware that IGCE may not be able to provide a particular service to them if Personal Information is not provided upon request. </p>
    <h3>3. MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <h4>3.1	Who may view Personal Information</h4>
    <p>In general, only officers, employees or contractors of IGCE may view Personal Information. </p>
    <p>IGCE will only grant access to parties other than IGCE's officers, employees and contractors to view Personal Information where IGCE believes that access is necessary to achieve the purpose for which the Personal Information was collected. </p>
    <p>IGCE will only disclose Personal Information to parties other than IGCE's officers, employees and contractors if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) that disclosure is required to give effect to the purposes for which IGCE collected the Personal Information; </li>
      <li>(b) the Customer has consented to that disclosure; </li>
      <li>(c) IGCE believes that the disclosure may lessen a risk of harm to the health or safety of any person; </li>
      <li>(d) IGCE believes an unlawful activity is being undertaken and the Personal Information is disclosed as part of IGCE's investigation into this activity; </li>
      <li>(e) IGCE is required by law to disclose the Personal Information; or </li>
      <li>(f) the disclosure is required for the enforcement of a criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of public revenue. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3.2	Storage and Security</h4>
    <p>Your Personal Information will generally be stored in IGCE databases located in the United States. To the extent required by law, if your personal information will be transferred outside your country an appropriate notice will be provided. <br>
      IGCE maintains reasonable safeguards to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your Personal Information. For example, we use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to transfer Personal Information over the Internet. Although we use security measures to help protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure, misuse or alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control. </p>
    <p>Personal Information may also be stored in hard copy form. Hard copy Personal Information is, wherever practical, kept under locked security. </p>
    <h4>3.3	Updating Personal Information</h4>
    <p>IGCE regularly monitors the quality and accuracy of Personal Information that it maintains and where practical, updates that information on a regular basis. Customers may review, correct and update the Personal Information that you provide to us at an IGCE Internet Site by using the feedback mechanisms provided at a particular IGCE Internet Site or by writing to us at iPic-Gold Class Entertainment, 433 Plaza Real Boulevard, Suite 335, Boca Raton, FL  33432. Main phone line (561)886-3232. </p>
    <h3>4. CHILDREN</h3>
    <p>IGCE does not specifically target its online services to children under 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13 you may use our website only under the supervision and with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Where IGCE is aware that it is gathering information from a minor, IGCE will obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian for the collection of the information. Where this is not possible, IGCE's staff will not knowingly collect Personal Information from a minor under age 13. If your child has submitted Personal Information and you would like to request that such information be deleted from our records, you may do so using the feedback mechanisms provided at the website, or by writing to us at iPic-Gold Class Entertainment, 433 Plaza Real Boulevard, Suite 335, Boca Raton, FL  33432. Main phone line (561)886-3232. </p>
    <h3>5. CONTESTS</h3>
    <p>Personal Information gathered during contests run by IGCE will be governed by the principles set out in this Privacy Policy unless an express statement is made in relation to privacy in the conditions of entry for the contest. </p>
    <h3>6. DIRECT MARKETING</h3>
    <p>Personal Information collected for direct marketing purposes will only be collected, used or disclosed with the consent of the relevant Customer as provided for in this Privacy Policy. In circumstances where IGCE cannot practically obtain the consent of a Customer, then IGCE may still engage in direct marketing to that Customer, but will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) advise the Customer that he or she can be taken off the mailing list at any time; and</li>
      <li>(b) display its contact details clearly in each direct marketing publication. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Customers may be taken off any mailing list or may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from IGCE by either writing to us at iPic-Gold Class Entertainment, 433 Plaza Real Boulevard, Suite 335, Boca Raton, FL  33432, or by contacting IGCE's Privacy Officer as described in Paragraph 10, below. </p>
    <h3>7. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>Customers may access their Personal Information by contacting IGCE's Privacy Officer as described in Paragraph 10, below. Access is generally granted within 30 days of that request. IGCE may impose a reasonable charge for access. </p>
    <h3>8. WHEN IGCE MAY WITHHOLD ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <h4>8.1	When access can be withheld</h4>
    <p>Access to Personal Information may be withheld in a number of circumstances. These include where: </p>
    <p>(a) providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of a person;</p>
    <p>(b) providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others; </p>
    <p>(c) the information is subject to confidentiality where the person who provided the information to IGCE did so expressly on the condition that it remains confidential; </p>
    <p>(d) the request is vexatious or frivolous; </p>
    <p>(e) the information relates to current or anticipated legal proceedings between IGCE and the person and the information would not be available pursuant to the applicable rules of discovery; </p>
    <p>(f) IGCE is in commercial negotiations with the person and the information would reveal IGCE's intentions; </p>
    <p>(g) providing access would be unlawful or IGCE is required by a law to withhold access; or </p>
    <p>(h) providing access could prejudice the investigation or detection by IGCE or by a government body of an unlawful activity or some serious or improper misconduct. Where IGCE does withhold Personal Information, IGCE may instead choose to give the Customer a summary of that information. </p>
    <h4>8.2	Written reasons</h4>
    <p>If IGCE does withhold Personal Information, IGCE will provide written reasons. </p>
    <h4>8.3	Third party intermediary</h4>
    <p>If IGCE withholds access to Personal Information, IGCE will consider whether the provision of access to an independent third party will meet IGCE's and the relevant Customer's needs. </p>
    <h3>9. CONTRACTORS</h3>
    <p>IGCE may from time to time employ subcontractors to provide services to it. In these situations, Personal Information may be collected about those subcontractors. This Privacy Policy applies equally to those subcontractors. </p>
