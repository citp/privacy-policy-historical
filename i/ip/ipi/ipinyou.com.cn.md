Collection, Use, and Retention OF Non-PII

We collect non-PII on our website using cookies, web beacons, and tags for the operation of the site (e.g. managing user sessions), including analyzing site usage, detecting and preventing malicious behavior on the site, and improving the content and organization of the site. We also engage other companies that will use similar methods to collect non-PII on our website for analyzing site usage. 

We also use non-PII we collect to advertise our business on other sites, including through the Ipinyou Platform. When we do so, we act as a customer of the platform, using our own information, and we do not use or mix our information with the proprietary information of other Platform customers. You can learn more about the Ipinyou Platform in the Ipinyou Platform Privacy page, where you can also learn about how to opt out of having the Platform used by us and others for interest-based advertising.
