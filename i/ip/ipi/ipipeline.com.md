## **Cookies**

When you interact with the Site we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. 

Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser.  Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.

We use session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in.  This information allows us to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use our application.  We use persistent cookies, that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our user or prior Site visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.  Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our Service.

## **Third Party Cookies**

We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website to help us administer our website and improve its quality.  Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior.  Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information.  All data collected by such third parties on behalf of iPipeline is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties. 

## **Third-Party Sites**

The Site may contain links to other web sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Users will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites to understand their policies.  Users who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information.  It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential. 

## **Security**

Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Personal Information under our control. When our Site is accessed using Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.5 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that your Personal Information is safe, secure, and available only to you.  We also implement an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and host the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.  Finally, we provide unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on (unless you are entering the system through another trusted website).  These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information. 

Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their UserID and password.
