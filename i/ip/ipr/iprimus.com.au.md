## Privacy laws that apply to iPrimus

iPrimus is required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles ('APPs') set out in that Act. The APPs establish minimum standards for the collection, use, disclosure and handling of personal information. They apply to personal information in any form, including electronic and digital form. The APPs can be accessed at the website of the office of the Australian Information Commissioner: www.privacy.gov.au.

iPrimus is also subject to other laws relating to the protection of personal information. In particular, iPrimus is subject to privacy obligations under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth). iPrimus' direct marketing activities must also comply with the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth) and the Spam Act 2010 (Cth). If iPrimus collects health information, it may be required to comply with statutory requirements relating to health records.

In this Privacy Policy, unless the context other wise requires:

  * 'Privacy Law' refers to any legislative or other legal requirement that applies to iPrimus' collection, use, disclosure or handling of personal information.
  * 'Personal information' means information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether the information or opinion is recorded in material form or not. Personal information includes sensitive information.
  * 'Sensitive information' means personal information about an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or memberships, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, professional or trade association/union memberships, sexual preferences and practices or criminal record.



## Why does iPrimus collect personal information?

iPrimus collects personal information in order to:

  * manage and administer the products and services we provide, including for billing and credit control purposes;
  * inform customers about changes and improvements in iPrimus products and services;
  * market iPrimus products and services to current and prospective customers;
  * market third party products and services to current and prospective customers; and
  * comply with our legal obligations.



iPrimus needs to be able to collect personal information for most of its business activities, although the information we require depends on the particular circumstances. If we are unable to collect the personal information we need, we may be unable to meet the expectations of our customers or provide the products and services they wish to receive.

## Whose personal information does iPrimus collect?

iPrimus collects or holds personal information about individuals who are:

  * Prospective customers. This includes people we think may be interested in our products and services as well as people who have expressed interest in obtaining or learning more about those products and services.
  * Current customers. This includes people who purchase iPrimus products or services or who hold an account with iPrimus.
  * Past customers. These are people who have purchased iPrimus products or services but do not currently hold any active iPrimus account.



iPrimus may treat current and past customers as prospective customers for other iPrimus products and services.

iPrimus may collect personal information about associates of its customers, such as family members, employees or agents. For example, iPrimus may collect personal information about nominated or authorised representatives, the holder of a credit card that is used to pay a customer's account, a person who acts as a secondary account holder, a person who acts as guarantor for a credit contract, the landlord of a tenanted property or the nominated contact on a business account.

iPrimus may in rare circumstances collect personal information from people who are under the age of 18. If iPrimus does this, iPrimus may also collect personal information about the parent or guardian of that person.

iPrimus also collects personal information about all the individuals who are involved in providing iPrimus products and services. This includes:

  * staff of iPrimus Group entities and other companies in Vocus Communications; and
  * service providers and suppliers, agents and affiliates, and their staff.



## Can you deal with iPrimus without identifying yourself?

In some limited situations customers and other individuals may be able to deal with iPrimus anonymously or using a pseudonym. For example, if you make a general inquiry to one of our call centres, or want to make a complaint or log a service fault unless the inquiry or complaint relates to a particular account.

However, if you do not wish to be identified we may not be able to provide the information or assistance you require.

## What personal information does iPrimus usually collect?

iPrimus collects a wide range of personal information about its customers, but the type and amount of information collected depends on the particular business context. However, iPrimus seeks at all times to ensure that it only collects the personal information that is necessary for the purposes of its business activities.

iPrimus needs to collect basic identifying and contact information for all customers, including prospective customers. This will usually include name, date of birth, email address, telephone number(s) and residential address. For corporate and business customers, iPrimus collects information about nominated contacts, including name and title or position, date of birth, telephone number(s) and email and business addresses.

iPrimus also collects information about purchasing patterns, consumer preferences and attitudes from prospective and current customers for marketing purposes, including to analyse markets, develop marketing strategies and to identify and develop products and services that may be of interest to its customers.

  * Proof of identity information, including passport number, driver license number or other government identifiers. We need this information to ensure our customer records are accurate and up-to-date. We also may be required to obtain proof of identity information by law. For example, we are required under the Telecommunications Act 1997 to obtain specified proof of identity information before providing certain mobile telephone services.
  * Financial and credit information, including credit history, employment history, remuneration details, bank account and credit card information, information about assets and income and details of relevant court judgments and bankruptcies. We need this information to assess credit worthiness and financial suitability of current and prospective customers.
  * Information about medical conditions and concession entitlement. We need this information to assess eligibility for concessions or other benefits that may be available with iPrimus products or services.
  * Information relating to occupancy. We may need information to establish that a customer has rights to occupy the property to which we provide services, and for this purpose may require copies of tenancy agreements, mortgage records or utility bills or supply records.
  * Information relating to change of name or status, which may include marriage certificates, death certificates and other official documentation. We may need this information where we are asked to close or transfer an account.
  * Employment information, including information about employment history including current and past employers. We may need this information to assess the financial position of a person who applies to become an iPrimus customer.
  * Integrated Public Number Database (IPND). In providing telecommunications services, iPrimus is required by law to collect certain personal information about you, including your name, address, telephone service number and other public number customer details, and to provide it to the operator of the IPND) for inclusion in the IPND. Information in the IPND is used to develop directories and to assist emergency service organisations. If your phone number is unlisted, your information will be marked accordingly in the IPND and its use and disclosure will be strictly controlled.

  * service usage (including use of communications services, internet usages);
  * responses to offers made and/or promotions run by iPrimus or its affiliates;
  * payment patterns and history; and
  * inquiries and complaints.



We collect information about our employees and prospective employees for the purpose of making employment decisions and managing our staff. We also collect information about suppliers, service providers, agents and affiliates, and their staff, for the purposes of conducting our day-to-day business activities.

## How does iPrimus collect personal information?

We collect personal information by various means and via various media, depending on the particular business context.

We collect information about prospective customers both directly and via our agents, service providers and affiliates. We may collect this information:

  * when you make an inquiry at an iPrimus kiosk, iPrimus dealer or iPrimus event;
  * through our door to door sales activities;
  * through our call centres;
  * through iPrimus websites, or websites operated by iPrimus' affiliates;
  * through social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook; and
  * through the purchase of marketing lists, databases and data aggregation services.



When you become or apply to become an iPrimus customer, in addition to collecting personal information directly from you, we may also collect information about you from our agents and affiliates, credit reporting agencies, your past and present employers, current service providers, family members or associates and other third parties.

When you apply to become an iPrimus customer, we will ask you to consent to us collecting information from particular third parties. We will only collect personal information from those parties if you consent. If you do not consent, we may not be able to provide the service or product you require. We are authorised to collect some personal information from third parties under Privacy Law.

iPrimus receives unsolicited personal information from time to time. In accordance with its obligations under Privacy Law, iPrimus will decide whether it would have been permitted to solicit and collect that information and if it would not have been, will destroy or de-identify the information (provided it is lawful to do so).

## What information will iPrimus give you when it collects personal information?

iPrimus is required by Privacy Law to take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of certain information when it collects personal information about you. For example, we are required to:

  * tell you which iPrimus entity you are dealing with and how to contact it;
  * make sure you are aware that we have collected the information (if we collect it from a third party without your knowledge);
  * identify any law that authorises or requires collection of the information;
  * let you know the purposes for which we collect the information, the entities that the information is likely to be disclosed to and whether the information will be transferred outside Australia; and
  * tell you how to access our Privacy Policy and complaint handling procedures.



This Privacy Policy sets out this information in general terms. However, where we collect personal information in relation to a particular product or service, and the information we are required to provide is not likely to be obvious from the circumstances, we usually provide the required information in a 'collection statement'. The way we do this will depend on how you are dealing with us. For example:

  * When personal information is collected via the iPrimus website or any affiliate website that iPrimus may advertise on, a statement is displayed or a link provided to a statement that sets out the information we are required to provide.
  * A statement containing the required information is printed on the sign-up page of most of the standard forms we use to collect personal information.
  * When you deal with us on the telephone, this information is given to you by the operator or via a recorded message.



If we collect personal information about you from a third party, we take reasonable steps to ensure you receive the information we are required to provide. However, we may do this by requiring the third party to provide the information, rather than us providing the information to you directly.

We may also include information about our collection of personal information in welcome packs, customer account statements, update bulletins, notices and other documents we give to our customers.

## iPrimus' use and disclosure of personal information

Where iPrimus collects personal information for a particular purpose, it may use and disclose the information for that purpose or another purpose that is related to that purpose (or that is directly related to that purpose in the case of sensitive information). For example:

## How does iPrimus protect your personal information?

iPrimus recognises the importance of protecting your personal information and of ensuring that it is complete, accurate, up-to-date and relevant.

When you call iPrimus, we complete an ID check to verify your identity and to check the details we hold about you are correct and to update them if required. For some safety critical information, for example medical information required to ensure priority assistance, we initiate checks on an annual basis.

We have documented processes for verifying personal information collected for particular transactions, such as proof of occupancy, change of occupier and priority assistance. Our staff is trained to properly handle the different types of information they receive, particularly sensitive information. We have quality assurance measures in place to monitor calls to ensure that our processes are being followed.

While some of the personal information we collect is held in hardcopy form, most personal information is stored in electronic databases.

We have extensive processes in place to ensure that our information systems and files are kept secure from unauthorised access and interference. These include:

  * System access is controlled by logins and different security levels. Access to customer information for all staff (including agents in our Manila call centre) is centrally controlled. Access requests must be supported by a request from senior management.
  * Access authorisation is layered and access authorisations are specific to the job function of each staff member. For example, staff with responsibility for fault management has no access to credit card information. Staff is only trained in areas of the system specific to the function of their job.
  * Functional restrictions apply. Remote access is only available to selected senior staff members. Measures are taken to prevent printing, copying or recording of customer information that can be accessed electronically. For example, call centre team members work in a paperless environment, cannot print information and are not permitted to have mobile phones or cameras on the call centre floor.
  * Account and system access and modification is logged to enable access or modification of any customer record by any staff member to be identified. Audits of access logs are conducted periodically.
  * Our employees undergo privacy and information security training on induction and are required to sign acknowledgements of their obligations in relation information security and appropriate use of our IT systems.
  * We have contractual arrangements in place with our agents, service providers and affiliates that require them to have comply with applicable privacy laws and iPrimus privacy policies. Our contractual arrangements with third parties who are outside Australia are designed to ensure that personal information transferred to those parties is afforded the same level of protection as would apply to the information in Australia.



## Can you access or correct personal information iPrimus holds about you?

You have a right to access personal information we hold about you. If your request is particularly complex or requires detailed searching of our records, there may be a cost to you in order for us to provide you with this information.

If you believe there are errors in the information we hold about you, you have a right to ask us to correct the information.

However, we are not required to provide access where we believe doing so would:

  * prejudice law enforcement or crime prevention activities;
  * pose a serious threat to health or safety;
  * have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
  * prejudice iPrimus in legal proceedings or negotiations with you;
  * reveal information connected with a commercially sensitive decision making process; or
  * be contrary to law.



If you wish to have access to information iPrimus holds about you, you should contact iPrimus Customer Service.
