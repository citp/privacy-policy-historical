# Privacy Policy | iProspect | Digital Performance on a Global Scale

iProspect is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of all visitors to our website. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us information about yourself. Yet, there are times when we do need to collect your personal information to provide services you’ve requested from us. Our privacy policy outlines how we collect and use your personal information.

**What information do you collect?**  
We collect your personal information, which includes, but is not limited to: your first and last name, email address, physical address, contact information, title, industry and other information.

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously. We do log your IP address to give us an idea of which part of the website you visit and how long you spend there. Your IP address is not linked to any personal information unless you have shared this information through a form on our website.

We do use “cookies” to collect information about how you use our site. Cookies are small packets of information stored by your web browser based on the websites you visit. These cookies do not contain personal information about you, but allow us to know how many times you visit our website or related websites.

**When do you collect my information?**  
We collect your information when you register for a whitepaper, case study, webcast, or download content, attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, or ask to be included in an email or other mailing list.

**What do you do with the information?**  
Because iProspect is a global company, we may share your personal information with our other global offices. All such entities are governed by this privacy policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.

Your personal information is never shared outside iProspect without your permission.

**What about third-party sites?**  
Our website does link to other websites. We do not share your personal information with them and are not responsible for their privacy practices. Once you have left our website, we recommend you read the privacy policies of these third-party websites.
