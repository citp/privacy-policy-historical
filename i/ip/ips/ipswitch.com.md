**WEB VISIT INFORMATION**

When you visit our website, our server logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, and the time and duration of the pages on our website that you view. Ipswitch uses “cookies” on its own behalf so that we can better serve you with tailored information when you return to our site. Cookies are identifiers that a web site can send to your browser to keep on your computer to facilitate your next visit to our site.

Ipswitch uses a third party vendor to help measure and analyze the effectiveness of its websites and how visitors use its websites. To do this, tracking techniques (e.g., cookies) are used to collect information, including the pages visited and navigation patterns, which help us learn how visitors use our sites, and what information is of the most interest to visitors to our website. Web-visit information may include the following:

  * _Web Beacons_ : A Web beacon is a small image we place in our Web-based e-mail communications. Web beacons allow us to access our cookie to tell us whether you have viewed our e-mail. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, the Web beacon will provide us only with information that an email has been viewed, but we will not be able to identify the visit with your browser.
  * _User Surveys_ : Your participation in surveys is optional, although we may require your participation as a condition to a trial use of our software. We use this information to help us improve our software, plan marketing initiatives, and develop new products that may interest you.
  * _Shopping Cart_ : We use cookies to identify you as a previous visitor to our Web site and keep track of items in your shopping cart. We may tie the cookie to any personal information we have about you.
  * _Software Reporting_ : Some of our products may transmit system, device or other product usage related information back to us. Depending on the application, this information may be anonymous or it may be associated with you.

Ipswitch may use the personal information you provide us for a variety of purposes, including support, authentication, marketing, and may share information for sales and marketing with our affiliates. We may also use your personal information to inform you of special offers, upgrades and other Ipswitch products and services that may be of interest to you. We may also provide you with materials concerning the products and/or services of other third parties we think may be of interest to you.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES**

If you provide personal information to Ipswitch, you agree and consent to Ipswitch’s storage and usage of this information anywhere that Ipswitch and its affiliates maintain offices (around the world), for a variety of purposes, including those described here. We will not disclose your personal information except as follows:

  * To protect Ipswitch and others, we may release personal information and IP addresses when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our software licenses and other rights, or to protect the rights and safety of others. This may include exchanging information with law enforcement agencies, or with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * To persons who help us provide our products and services to you. Ipswitch stores the personal data of customers and web site visitors indefinitely and may maintain and process such information directly or indirectly in one or more databases in the United States or elsewhere. We may provide personal and other information to third parties who work for us, such as companies that verify credit card information, process credit card payments, fulfill orders, provide customer service, analyze customer data, remove repetitive information from customer lists, and provide marketing services. Any such company or third party is required to maintain the confidentiality of that information and is prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than as authorized by us.
  * As part of a sale of our assets or a merger of our company. We may in the future sell all or part of our assets or be involved in a merger. It is customary for user information to be included with the transferred assets in these types of transactions.
  * To the Bureau of Export Administration. We are required by law to furnish a report to the United States Bureau of Export Administration stating the names and addresses of all non-U.S. businesses or organizations (but not individual consumers) who purchase online or register any of our software that contains an encryption feature.



We may share non-personally identifiable aggregate statistical information about our users with third parties.

**CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES**

Ipswitch may also disclose such personal information if required by law or if Ipswitch believes that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a warrant, subpoena, or other court order) or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ipswitch, our customers or the public. We may also disclose user information when necessary to enforce our Terms of Use.

Ipswitch does not embed advertising (adware) in any of our software, for two principal reasons. First, adware can be used to monitor your use of software (such as sites selected or files used) or to provide demographic data about you to third parties.

These links to other sites do not imply affiliation or endorsement of any linked site in any way.

The Website may make discussion boards, groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personally identifiable information.

**CHILDREN**

This Website is not directed at persons under 18 years of age and our content and other services are not written, intended, or designed for persons under 18 years of age. We do not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from such individuals. Where appropriate, Ipswitch will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on the Website. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us at the mailing address or e-mail address listed at the bottom of this policy if he would like this information deleted from our records.
