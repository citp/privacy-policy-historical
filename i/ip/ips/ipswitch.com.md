# Privacy Policy — Ipswitch.com

Ipswitch is committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information collection and use practices for our Website.

**WHAT INFORMATION DOES IPSWITCH.COM COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED?**

When you place an order, download an evaluation, join a discussion list, subscribe to a newsletter, or contact us for support (technical or customer), we ask for your contact or billing information which is used for internal operations and/or to provide you with updated information on our products.

  * When you download an evaluation or a white paper, we may forward your contact information to a registered Ipswitch value-added reseller who may contact you. Other than for this purpose, we do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.
  * If you contact us for technical support, we may invite you afterwards to let us know how we’re doing by participating in an online survey.
  * Users may opt-out of receiving future marketing mailings; see the opt-out section below.



**CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES**

We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure may be required by law or if we receive legal process.

**HOW DOES IPSWITCH USE MY E-MAIL ADDRESS AND CAN I OPT-OUT OF RECEIVING IPSWITCH E-MAIL MESSAGES?**

_Download an evalaution:_ We ask for your e-mail address before downloading a free product evaluation. If at anytime you decide that you do not want to receive further marketing messages from us, each e-mail will include a link to our [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/remove.asp). Your contact information may be forwarded to an authorized Ipswitch reseller in your area, in which case you may need to follow-up with them. Unsubscribing will not interrupt any ongoing conversations you may be having with Ipswitch.

_Contacting us for technical or customer support:_ Your e-mail address will be used to respond to your query. In some cases, we may invite you to participate in an online survey to let us know how we are doing.

If you are using the same e-mail address for multiple items above, the e-mail usage information for ‘downloading an evaluation’ takes precedent over all other e-mail usage information.

[You can also remove yourself from our marketing list.](https://web.archive.org/remove.asp)

If you opt out or unsubscribe, we may, in compliance with the United States CAN SPAM Act of 2003, run our suppression list (addresses not to be emailed) against another list of names for an Ipswitch mailing or provide our suppression list to a third party for such verification.

When you opt-out or unsubscribe, you are doing so from our marketing messages. We may continue to send you transactional messages relevant to our business relationship. Transactional messages include information on product updates and upgrades, Service Agreement and subscription expirations and renewals, responses to inquiries, surveys and other information related to the product you downloaded or purchased.

**CAN I CHANGE/MODIFY MY CONTACT INFO?**

To modify your contact information previously provided, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/company/contact/).

**ADWARE POLICY**

Ipswitch does not embed advertising (adware) in any of our software, for two principal reasons. First, adware can be used to monitor your use of software (such as sites selected or files used) or to provide demographic data about you to third parties. Second, we consider it very important not to compromise the quality, speed, and ease of use of our software by displaying ads in it.
