          <p></p><li><a name="1"></a><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong></li>
          <p><strong>Personal Information </strong> is any information that is identifiable with you. This information may include but is not limited to your name, mailing address, phone numbers, email address, identification numbers and, in certain circumstances, your opinions and individual preferences. Personal Information, however, does not include (i) your name, business title or business address and business telephone number and fax in your capacity as an employee of an organization; and (ii) depending on the jurisdiction, publicly available information. However, if in your capacity as an employee of an organization you participate in one of our surveys, your responses will be treated as Personal Information. <strong></strong></p>

          <li> <a name="2"></a><strong>How do we collect your Personal Information?</strong><br>
            <p>
          We will always collect your Personal Information by fair and lawful means (for example, when you respond to one of our surveys). We collect your Personal Information where we have obtained your consent to do so or as otherwise permitted by law. </p>

One of the primary purposes for which we collect your Personal Information is to conduct marketing and social research through conducting surveys. We may also use your Personal Information as otherwise permitted by law. If you provide us with sensitive personal information such as health or financial information, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal information. </p>
