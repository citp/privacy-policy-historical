			<h1 align="left">Privacy Policy Statement</h1>
			<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have 
			developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, 
			use, communicate and make use of personal information. The following 
			outlines our Privacy Policy. When accessing our Website, <strong>
			Evergreen Media</strong> will learn certain information about you 
			during your visit. Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web 
			site utilizes a standard technology called cookies (see explanation 
			below, What Are Cookies?) and Web server logs to collect information 
			about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies 
			and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the 
			pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited 
			just before and just after our Web site, your IP address. </p>
			<p><strong>DoubleClick Cookie</strong> </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve 
				ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.</li>
				<li>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its 
				partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your 
				sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
				<li>Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for 
				interest-based advertising by visiting the
				<a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">ads preference 
				manager</a>. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of 
				a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based 
				advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">
				aboutads.info</a>.)</li>
			</ul>
			You can read more about Google's Advertising and Cookies here:
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/">
			http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a> 
			<p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong> </p>
			<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an 
			anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's 
			computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a 
			part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each 
			Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's 
			preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser 
			only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to 
			you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. </p>
			<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
			<p>Your computer uses IP addresses every time you are connected to 
			the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers 
			on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are 
			automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and 
			profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web 
			pages you request) can be sent to you. </p>
			<p><strong>Email Information</strong> </p>
			<p>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain 
			the content of your email messages together with your email address 
			and our responses. We provide the same protections for these 
			electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of 
			information received online, mail and telephone. </p>
			<p><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong></p>
			<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of 
			administering our business activities, providing customer service 
			and making available other items and services to our customers and 
			prospective customers. <strong>Evergreen Media</strong> will not 
			obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit 
			our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us, nor 
			will such information be sold or otherwise transferred to 
			unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the 
			time of collection. We may disclose information when legally 
			compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe 
			that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
			<p><strong>A Special Note About Children</strong></p>
			<p>Children are not eligible to use our web site and services and we 
			ask that minors (under the age of 13) do not submit any personal 
			information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this site only in 
			conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or 
			guardians. </p>
			<p><strong>How Do We Protect Your Information and Secure Information 
			Transmissions? </strong></p>
			<p>Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For 
			this reason, we request that you do not send private information to 
			us by email. However, doing so is allowed, but at your own risk. 
			Some of the information you may enter on our Web site may be 
			transmitted securely via a secure medium known as Secure Sockets 
			Layer, or SSL. Credit Card information is never transmitted via 
			email. <strong>Evergreen Media</strong> may use software programs to 
			create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as 
			assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our 
			site, what information is of most and least interest, determining 
			technical design specifications, and identifying system performance 
			or problem areas. For site security purposes and to ensure that this 
			service remains available to all users, <strong>Evergreen Media</strong> 
			uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify 
			unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise 
			cause damage. </p>
			<p><strong>Policy Changes</strong> </p>
			<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time 
			with or without notice. However, please be assured that if the 
			Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal 
			information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a 
			manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, 
			without your prior consent. We are committed to conducting our 
			business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that 
			the confidentiality of personal information is protected and 
			maintained. </p>
			<p><strong>Contact</strong> </p>
			<p>If you have any questions regarding this Policy, or your dealings 
			with our web site, please contact us. </p>
