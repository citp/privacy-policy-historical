      COLLECTION AND USE</b> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">iPetitions collects 
        information at different points on our website. The two main points at 
        which we collect information are when new <b>members</b> join iPetitions 
        and when outside users <b>sign</b> a petition powered by iPetitions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Members</b>: When 
        you become a member of iPetitions, you provide us with your name, email 
        address, country, and zip code. iPetitions is the sole owner of this information 
        and we will not sell, share, or rent this information with any other company 
        or individual in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
        From time to time, we may share your information with others on an aggregated 
        basis. We will not share information in such a way that it can be linked 
        to an individual. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sign:</b> When 
        you sign a petition powered by iPetitions, you will be asked for your 
        name, and you may be asked for your email address as well as certain demographic 
        information. Some of this information may be optional, but we encourage 
        you to provide it as it will allow us to better customize your experience. 
        The information you provide when you sign a petition is stored on our 
        servers but is the exclusive property of the petition host, who is a member 
        of iPetitions and who has agreed to the terms of this privacy policy. 
        As with the information you supply iPetitions, hosts will be asked not 
        to sell, share, or rent this information with any other company or individual 
        except in an aggregated form. There is one exception to this rule, however, 
        and that is when the petition is presented to its designated recipient. 
        At such time, the recipient will receive a disaggregated list of names 
        with some or all of the information they provided when they signed the 
        petition. This is because a petition is far more likely to be effective 
        when its recipients receives a list of signatures rather than simply an 
        aggregated number of signatures. No individual or organization other than 
        the designated recipient will receive this disaggegated information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please be aware that 
        this applies only to petitions powered by iPetitions on iPetitions' servers 
        (these petitions will have a URL of the form: http://www.ipetitions.com/petitionname.html). 
        Petitions sponsored by external organizations but using our software may 
        have different privacy policies. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ad Services:</b> 
        In addition, some user information is collected by third-party ad services. 
        Users always have a choice of whether to supply this information and in 
        no case is the information collected without their knowledge. iPetitions 
        does not maintain any control over the information supplied to these ad 
        services and this information will be used in accordance with the privacy 
        policies of these outside services. iPetitions uses these services in 
        order to allow us to keep supplying free and subsidized petition services. 
        We have screened external privacy policies to ensure that personal user 
        information is not misused, but we encourage users with concerns to contact 
        us directly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <b>Exception:</b> iPetitions may disclose user or signer information when 
        we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary 
        to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
        violating our Membership Agreement or may be causing injury or interference, 
        intentionally or unintentionally, to iPetitions' rights or property, other

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This website takes 
        every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit 
        sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both 
        online and off-line. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When our registration/order 
        form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number 
        and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected 
        with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure 
        page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers 
        such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, 
        as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While we use SSL encryption 
        to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our 
        power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, 
        not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our 
        offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
        job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
        are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, 
        ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 
        Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees 
        are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
        and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.</font></p>
