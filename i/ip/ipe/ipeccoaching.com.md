The ELI is available through an iPEC Certified Professional Coach and the SCOPE assessment is available on our mobile application (“ **App** ”) available for free download on mobile and/or tablet devices.

  4. **DATA RETENTION**



We keep Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer. Generally, we maintain student records for a minimum of seven years, subject to applicable laws and regulations and legitimate business needs to retain data for longer periods. 

If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**Legitimate Interest**. “Legitimate interests” means our interests in conducting our business and developing a business relationship with you. This Privacy Policy describes when we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests, what these interests are and your rights. We will not use your Personal Data for activities where the impact on you overrides our interests, unless we have your consent or those activities are otherwise required or permitted by law.

**Data Transfers.** We rely on our EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification to transfer Personal Data that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to iPEC in the U.S. (for more information, please read the “Privacy Shield” section below).

**Privacy Shield**

iPEC and its subsidiary, New England Coaching, comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. iPEC has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks, and to view our certification page, please visit https://[www.privacyshield.gov/.](http://www.privacyshield.gov/) 

**General**. We rely on our Privacy Shield certifications to transfer Personal Data that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. and we process such Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“ **Privacy Shield Principles** ”), as described below.

**Notice And Choice.**  This Privacy Policy provides notice of the Personal Data collected and transferred under the Privacy Shield, the purposes for the transfer and the choice that you have with respect to such Personal Data. It also provides information about other Privacy Shield Principles that are set forth below.

**Accountability for Onward Transfers.  **We may be accountable for the Personal Data that we transfer to third-party service providers (described in the “Sharing and Disclosure of Information” section above). If such service providers process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are responsible for the harm caused.

**Security.  **We maintain security measures to protect Personal Data as described in the “Security” section of this Privacy Policy.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.**  We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, and that it is accurate, complete and current for as long as we retain it. Our data retention practices are described in the “Data Retention” section of this Privacy Policy.

**Access.**  EU users have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. Please see the “Your Rights” section above for more information on the rights of users in the EU (and, to the extent applicable, users in Switzerland). When we process Personal Data as a data processor on behalf of our coaches, we will process such requests pursuant to our contract with the relevant coach and our coach’s instructions.

**Recourse, Enforcement,  Liability**. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at [privacy@ipeccoaching.com](mailto:privacy@ipeccoaching.com). 

iPEC has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (ICDR/AAA), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit [www.icdr.org](https://www.icdr.org/) for more information or to file a complaint. The services of ICDR/AAA are provided at no cost to you.

If your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under certain conditions a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. For additional information, please visit: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.

We are subject to investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Frameworks.

  * **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**



iPEC is based in the United States. The information collected through the Site and the App will be stored on and transferred to the offices of iPEC and its authorized third-party business vendors located globally, including in the United States and Canada, and processed globally for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that the countries concerned may not provide the same legal standards for protection of your Personal Data that you have in the EEA. Canada has been considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data (Commission’s Decision 2002/2/EC). We rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses to transfer personal data we receive from our EU-based authorized licensees. We are also certified to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks for the transfer of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. (for more information, please read the “Privacy Shield” section above).

iPEC’s Site and communications may contain links to other sites not operated or controlled by iPEC, including Social Media Sites (“ **Third Party Sites** ”). The information that you share with Third Party Sites will be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of the Third Party Sites and not by this Privacy Policy. By providing these links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed these sites. Please contact the Third Party Sites directly for information on their privacy practices and policies. iPEC is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites not affiliated with iPEC. 

  * **SECURITY**



Our Site, systems, apps and services use physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect information collected online including firewalls to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

  * **CHANGE TO THE PRIVACY POLICY**



Our services and our business may change from time to time. As a result we may change this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do we will post an updated version on this page, unless another type of notice is required by the applicable law. By continuing to use our Site or providing us with Personal Data after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy, or notified you if applicable, you consent to the revised Privacy Policy and practices described in it.
