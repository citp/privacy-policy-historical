# Privacy Statement | iPetitions

## INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

iPetitions collects information at different points on our website. The two main points at which we collect information are when new members join iPetitions and when outside users sign a petition powered by iPetitions.

**Members:** When you become a member of iPetitions, you provide us with your name and other information, email address. iPetitions is the sole owner of this information and we will not sell, share, or rent this information with any other company or individual in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. From time to time, we may share your information with others on an aggregated basis. We will not share information in such a way that it can be linked to an individual.

**Sign:** When you sign a petition powered by iPetitions, you will be asked for your name, and you may be asked for your email address as well as certain demographic information. Some of this information may be optional, but we encourage you to provide it as it will allow us to better customize your experience. In addition, we store your IP address in our database. The information you provide and your IP address are stored on our servers but can also be accessed by the petition host, who is a member of iPetitions and who has agreed to the terms of this privacy policy. As with the information you supply iPetitions, hosts will be asked not to sell, share, or rent this information with any other company or individual except in an aggregated form. 

There are three possible exceptions to this rule, however, and those are when 1) a petition host submits a petition to its intended recipient; or 2) on the "Signatures" section of the petition. In the second case, your email address will never be publicly visible, and you have the option when signing a petition of asking that your name also not be displayed. In the first case, it is up to the discretion of the petition host as to what information he or she may submit to the petition's intended recipient. Petition hosts may choose to submit emails and names (as well as other information) as such information is likely to enhance the credibility of a petition.

Please be aware that this applies only to petitions powered by iPetitions on iPetitions' servers (these petitions will have a URL of the form: http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/some_petition). Petitions sponsored by external organizations but using our software may have different privacy policies.

**3) The third exception:** iPetitions may disclose user or signer information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary for legal reasons. We may do so in response to a specific legal query, or even without such a query if we have reason to believe that sharing such information may be: in the interests of public or private safety; necessary to prevent or remedy an illegal or potentially illegal act (in any jurisdiction of the world); necessary to prevent harm to iPetitions, our members, users, or any other member of the public anywhere in the world; or any other reason which we believe to be valid or necessary. In the event we share information in response to a specific legal query or request (including but not limited to a court order, police request, or subpoena), we may choose solely at our own discretion to waive the requirement of service of summons and respond to a verbal, emailed or other request. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN IPETITIONS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SHARING INFORMATION IF WE HAVE SHARED THE INFORMATION WITH THE BELIEF (WHETHER THAT BELIEF LATER PROVES FOUNDED OR UNFOUNDED) THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR LEGAL OR OTHER REASONS.

Please be aware that these exceptions and policies (as well as those contained elsewhere in this Privacy Statement) apply only to petitions powered by iPetitions on iPetitions' servers. Petitions sponsored by external organizations but using our software may have different privacy policies.

**Ad Services:** In addition, some user information is collected by third-party ad services. Users always have a choice of whether to supply this information and in no case is the information collected without their knowledge. iPetitions does not maintain any control over the information supplied to these ad services and this information will be used in accordance with the privacy policies of these outside services. iPetitions uses these services in order to allow us to keep supplying free and subsidized petition services. We have screened external privacy policies to ensure that personal user information is not misused, but we encourage users with concerns to contact us directly. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT IPETITIONS CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY PRIVACY VIOLATIONS CONDUCTED BY THIRD PARTY SITES OR APPLICATIONS THAT WE USE ON OUR SITE.

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support.
