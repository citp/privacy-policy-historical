              At some IPP Media sites, you can enter contests, vote in polls or 
              otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such 
              as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums 
              or communities. The types of personally identifiable information 
              that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail 
              address, telephone number, fax number and information about your 
              interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.<br>
              <br>
              At some other IPP Ltd. sites, you can submit information about other 
              people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail 
              address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a 
              gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might 
              submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally 
              identifiable information that may be collected about other people 
              at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, 
              and telephone number.<br>
              <br>
              At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide 
              us with the requested personally identifiable information will be 
              able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate 
              in the site's activities and offerings.<br>
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="contentBodytext">We also may collect certain non-personally 
              identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such 
              as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), 
              the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or 
              Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., 
              Raha.com, AOL).</span></p>
            <p class="bodyhead"><span class="storyHead">How We Use the Information</span><span class="contentBodytext"><br>
              We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill 
              your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond 
              to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, 
              programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.<br>
              <br>
              We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such 
              as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we 
              make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request 
              by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account 
              with us.<br>
              <br>
              From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our 
              products, programs, or services to them.<br>
              The information we collect in connection with our online forums 
              and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We 
              use this information to facilitate participation in these online 
              forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, 
              programs, or services.<br>
              <br>
              If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter 
              to our editors"), we may publish your screen name and other 
              information you have provided to us.<br>
              <br>
              We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that 
              we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to 
              enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use 
              this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well 
              as to offer you products, programs, or services.<br>
              <br>
              We may disclose personally identifiable information in response 
              to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a 
              subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a 
              law enforcement agency's request.<br>
              <br>
              Agents and contractors of IPP Ltd. who have access to personally 
              identifiable information are required to protect this information 
              in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for 
              example, not using the information for any purpose other than to 
              carry out the services they are performing for IPP Ltd.<br>
              <br>
              Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized 
              disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally 
              identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed 
              in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.<br>
              <br>
              Certain IPP Ltd. sites may disclose personally identifiable information 
              to companies whose practices are not covered by this privacy notice 
              (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory 
              databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products 
              or services to you. If a site shares personally identifiable information, 
              it is responsible to provide you information on how to opt out or 
              block such uses. <br>
              <br>
              We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside 
              records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or 
              services that may be of interest to you. <br>
              <br>
              Finally, the IPP Ltd. sites covered by this Privacy Notice will 
              not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided 
              to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also 
              providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated 
              uses.<br>
