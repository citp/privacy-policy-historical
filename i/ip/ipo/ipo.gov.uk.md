# Intellectual Property Office - Cookies and Privacy

Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task;
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested;
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.



You can manage these small files and learn more about them from [Directgov: Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them ](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/DG_197506?CID=Central&PLA=url_mon&CRE=managing_cookies "Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them").
