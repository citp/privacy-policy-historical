# IPO.com|Main|Privacy Policy

IPO.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy on the Internet. The following statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.

**Information We Gather**

_Contact Information_  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Registered users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and for other purposes. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

_Cookies_  
Our site uses "cookies" to deliver content specific to your interests and for other purposes. Cookies are used in our Research Center store to track a user's cart as that person shops on our site.

_Billing Information_  
For purchases in our Research Center store, all users must provide valid credit card and billing information at checkout. We do store the billing address information in our user database for tracking and statistical information. Credit card numbers ARE NOT stored in our database. After a purchase is authorized by the credit card provider, we only store the last four digits of the card for display purposes.

_Internet Demographic Information_  
IPO.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

**How We Use The Information**

_Contact Information_  
We use registered user contact information from our registration form to send the user information about our company and material from some of our partners. This includes e-newsletters, IPO Alerts, and other mailings related to our information and services. The registered user's contact information is also used to contact him or her when necessary, and is shared with other companies who may want to contact our users. We use our browser data to tailor visitors' experience at our site and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

IPO.com is co-branded among many other sites across the World Wide Web. User information is never disseminated to our partner web sites. The only information shared is unrelated to our registered user information.

_Cookies_  
We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. Some customer data is shared with the advertising companies.

**Contacting the Web Site**
