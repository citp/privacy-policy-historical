Additional personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. while completing an online contact form, as part of a registration, survey, competition, fulfilment of contract or an information request. This data is only collected and processed based on the original purpose of collection.

The legal basis for the processing of the aforementioned data categories is Art. 6 (1) f of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)).

###  **Performance of a contract**

For contractual reasons, we also need personal data to provide our services and comply with the obligations arising from contractual agreements concluded with you. This data is used e. g. for performing a (shipment) contract, managing customer data, handling payments and, as the case may be, assessing credit worthiness. Certain shipment data will also be provided to the authorities of the country of transit or destination for customs and tax clearance or for security screening, as required by the laws of such country. The information provided would usually include: shipper name and address, receiver name and address, description of the goods, number of pieces, weight and value of shipment.

Apart from an existing consent, we will process your e-mail address exclusively in order to provide you with information regarding DHL's own and similar products.

Legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. The processing of customer data for own direct marketing purposes is regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.

###  **Online presence and website optimization**

We use tracking software to determine how many users visit our website and how often. We do not use this software to collect individual personal data or individual IP addresses. The data is used solely in an anonymous and summarised form for statistical purposes and for developing the website.

###  **Use of Cookies**
