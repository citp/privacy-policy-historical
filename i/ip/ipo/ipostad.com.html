collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit
and/or transfer that personal information to third parties.  There is no way
you can modify this information and you have no right to do so.  Under the
terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any
information about our database.  In the event that the website, under advice of
counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit whatever
information is demanded by the website in insure that the website is releasing
information to the correct party.  Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this
website from complying.  While we take measures to ensure that outside parties
do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty
that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your
information.  (You should know that merchant service providers do not allow us
access to your credit card information.)� This Privacy Policy also is subject
to change without notice.  You are required to read it prior to using the
website.  By interacting with the website you agree to the terms and conditions
of the Privacy Policy.  By using the website or purchasing a product through
this website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to
address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration
