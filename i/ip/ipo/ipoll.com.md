iPoll Privacy Policy  
Last updated: 04/17/2013

iPoll is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. iPoll is a branded site owned and operated by Instantly, Inc., headquartered at 16501 Ventura Blvd., Suite 250, Encino, California, 91436, with its United Kingdom office located at 344-354 Gray’s Inn Road, London, WC1X 8BP. 

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website and services. By using this website and registering to our service you agree that your personal information will be shared with Instantly, Inc. in the United States where a lower level of privacy protection may apply than in your own country.

What personally identifiable information does iPoll collect from me?

iPoll collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of websites.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, iPoll asks for your name, email address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to iPoll and you can access the various protected areas of the site.

For a more detailed discussion about the collection of data through cookies, please see the section immediately below.

What are cookies and how does iPoll use them?

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, iPoll may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. Some areas on iPoll where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. This avoids you having to enter your login information many times in one day.

Currently, cookies are utilized by iPoll within the following four primary categories 1) business cookies which operate as a quality control and verification mechanism in connection with the survey process; (2) performance cookies so that traffic patterns and users on the iPoll website may be measured and optimized; (3) user cookies so that user information may be recorded so as to enhance performance and user experience on the website; and 4) targeting cookies which are utilized to measure web viewing for market research purposes.

If you do not wish to have your activity and browsing behavior tracked by iPoll, you may opt out by contacting our customer support team at support@surveyhelpcenter.com or selecting the opt-out button located on the “My Account” page. You can opt-out from the setting of such cookies by changing your settings within your browser. Furthermore you can set-up your browser so that the browser is asking you each time before a cookie is dropped on your device. Also you can delete all you cookies on your device within you browser. You can find all information about cookies, browser settings and cookie deletion on http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ If you have further question with regards to cookie settings please contact support@surveyhelpcenter.com 

In addition, from time to time, tracking mechanisms such as cookies or web beacons may be used by third party content and advertisings which you may choose to view while being on the iPoll site. You should review the privacy policies of the websites serving this content, as they may allow for the gathering of information to serve advertising on multiple third party websites over which iPoll has no control. Please consult the privacy policies of such third party websites for more information.

Who is collecting information and for what purpose?

iPoll collects valuable information, which assists in developing new products and services. When you are on a iPoll site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with iPoll or with any other third party with whom you elect to share such information, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than iPoll, the use of your data and personal information will be governed by appropriate confidentiality and security agreements between iPoll and such third parties. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or by electing not to participate in any given survey. 

Promotions that run on iPoll may be sponsored by companies other than iPoll or may be co-sponsored by iPoll and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared.

Any Sensitive Information (i.e. personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual) will be treated with additional care. If iPoll intends to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a different purpose than originally collected, then you will be expressly asked permission prior to any such disclosure or use.

Please be aware that iPoll advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit them. The information practices of those websites linked to iPoll are not covered by this privacy statement. Please consult the privacy policies of such third party websites for more information.

With whom does iPoll share my information?

As a general rule, iPoll will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or User Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors: iPoll may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If any personal data about you were ever to be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give iPoll permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer. 

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, iPoll may match user information with third party data. Also, iPoll discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

Other: iPoll may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating iPoll’s Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) iPoll’s rights or property, other iPoll users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. iPoll may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

Finally, if there is a sale of a majority of the shares or assets of the legal entities owning and operating iPoll, you agree that your personal information and data may be transferred or assigned to such new owners.

If personally identifiable information is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than iPoll, the use of such personal information will be governed by appropriate confidentiality and security agreements between iPoll and such third parties. Because iPoll surveys and solutions via mobile devices are not directed to children under the age of 13, we do not provide memberships to persons under age 13 for that purpose.
