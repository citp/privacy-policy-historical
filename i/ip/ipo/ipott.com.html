				<h2>Awareness</h2>
				<p class="content-txt">
					iPOTT provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every iPOTT.com, its subsidiaries' and affiliates' web pages. 
				 </p><br>

				<h2>What we collect</h2>
				<p class="content-txt">
					On some iPOTT web pages, you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information.
				</p>
				<p class="content-txt">
					In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. Some electronic newsletters record anonymous data about articles you have expressed interest in. 
				 </p>
				 <p class="content-txt">
					Some iPOTT.com web pages use cookies, a data analysis technique. To learn more, click here. <a href="#cookies" class="content-link">How iPOTT uses cookies.</a>
				 </p><br>
				 
				<h2>How we use it </h2>
				<p class="content-txt">
					iPOTT uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing, fraud protection, and are not retained for other purposes. 
				</p>

				<p class="content-txt">
					From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. 
				</p><br>

				<h2>Who we share it with </h2>
				<p class="content-txt">
					iPOTT will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other iPOTT entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in "how we use it". Such iPOTT entities and/or business partners, including those in the India and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.<br>
					Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of iPOTT products. 
				</p><br>			
				<h2>Choice</h2>
				<p class="content-txt">
					iPOTT will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. Local country laws and policies are applied.</p>
					<p>Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. For example, as part of iPOTT's commitment to offering you choice, we enable you to make online purchases directly from us or through our resellers. When you choose our resellers, we inform you that your registration and shopping basket data is being transferred to the reseller you selected. This notice is important because when you choose to make online purchases through our resellers, use of your registration and shopping basket data by the reseller is then governed by their privacy policy. Local country laws and policies are applied. 
				</p><br>
				
				<h2>Accuracy &amp; Access </h2>
				<p class="content-txt">
					iPOTT strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate.

To opt-out of iPOTT contact, provide your name, email and/or address and relevant information about subscriptions or registrations you may have with iPOTT. This opt-out will cancel all marketing and support communication and newsletters, including software driver subscriptions.

				 <h2>Oversight</h2>

					If you have comments or questions about our privacy policy, please <a class="content-link" href="http://www.ipott.com:80/jsp/contact.jsp">Contact us</a>.
				 </p><br>
					
				 <a name="cookies"></a>
				 <h2>How iPOTT uses cookies</h2>
				 <p class="content-txt">
					A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help us analyze web traffic or let us know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easy to shop by allowing you to drop things into a shopping cart; the cart itself is not the cookie, the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your cart versus others' in use at the same time. <br><br>
					iPOTT uses traffic log cookies to identify what pages are being used and which ones aren't. This helps us aggregate and analyze data about web page traffic and make improvements to iPOTT.com web sites to better meet customer needs. In this case, iPOTT uses this information only for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. That is the case of many of our support and information-sharing pages and forums. Denial of a traffic log cookie should not prevent you from using one of these sites. <br><br>
					A few iPOTT.com web sites use temporary cookies as part of the customer web navigation experience, tracking unique IDs for that particular web site session only. Examples are product registration sites. This cookie, by itself, only tells us that a previous iPOTT.com visitor has returned. If you deny the cookie, you can still use the site anonymously. When you register for the subscription service, it ensures that you are accurately identified and linked with your registration data.<br><br>
					Overall, cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. iPOTT wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We know that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our customers, we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our customers, so we respect these concerns. iPOTT works to continuously improve the iPOTT.com web experience and personal data privacy policy and practices.
