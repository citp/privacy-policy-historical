## 2\. Personal data:

**a) What is considered Personal Data?**

Under GDPR, Personal Data is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

**b) What is considered Special Category Data?**

Special Category Data is Personal Data which the GDPR says is more sensitive, and as such needs more protection.
