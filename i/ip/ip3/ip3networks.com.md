# Second Rule LLC

Second Rule LLC respects your privacy. We realize that the exciting growth of the Internet and online services raise questions concerning the nature, use and confidentiality of information collected about consumers. Second Rule LLC does not share, disclose or sell any personally-identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-Second Rule LLC marketing purposes. In the future, should Second Rule LLC decide to share such data with third parties for marketing, it will provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the Company not provide such information about them to third parties. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. 

Like most businesses today, Second Rule uses partners to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering services to you and so shares online data with those partners to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such partners must use that personally-identifiable information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. Second Rule LLC also shares such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks.

We also provide personally-identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with Second Rule LLC property or services, or with our customers' or others' use of them.

Second Rule LLC may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us - both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web site or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites.

At Second Rule LLC, we primarily use cookies to determine what products or promotions you are interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option to block them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, doing so may make some of our sites' features unavailable to you.

We use encryption, firewalls and other technology and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper use. For example, you will note that while using some features of the Second Rule LLC web site and online services, you will need to submit a password or some other type of authenticating information.

Second Rule LLC may use e-mail addresses you provide us online to send you e-mail related to Second Rule LLC products and services or if you have affirmatively indicated a desire to receive additional information. If at any time, you would prefer not to receive further marketing communications, please send an e-mail to: [sales@ip3.com.](mailto:sales@ip3.com)
