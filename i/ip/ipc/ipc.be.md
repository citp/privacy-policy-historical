**_If you are the sender or recipient of mail consignments, despatches, and items._**

(i) IPC may process personal data related to the movement of letters and goods across borders – usually in the postal system, as provided by, and transmitted to, the members and non-members of IPC. In principle, IPC only processes such personal data (such as your identification details, contact details, enquiries, signature, nature and physical description and barcode of postal items, customs data,  BIC and IBAN, as well as data relating to the delivery process) on behalf, and under the instructions of, postal operators using IPC' services, as data processor. 

(ii) IPC may, however, as data controller, in connection with those services, extract and process certain information relating to mail consignments provided by its members and non-members and processed through IPC's services for statistics, analytics and reporting purposes as defined by IPC. For such purposes, IPC only extracts and further processes non-personally identifiable information, i.e. only information relating to mail consignments not including the sender or recipient's identification details.

## Purposes for which We Process Personal Data

IPC processes the personal data detailed above for the following purposes:

(i) **Support of IPC members** : such as the eligibility, admission and ongoing management of members of IPC, the decision-making process within IPC, invoicing of members, dispute management and compliance with legal obligations;

(ii) **Management of IPC's contractors** : including the management of the contract with contractors, suppliers or vendors, invoicing, dispute management and compliance with legal obligations;

(iii) **Management of users of IPC's Sites and services** : including the creation and management of users' online accounts on IPC's Sites and/or services; the improvement of IPC's Sites and/or services; the provision of IPC's newsletter and other information (if requested by a user); 

(iv) **Reporting and analytics relating to postal services and consignments** [and other services]: the production and analysis of performance reports – in which personal data are aggregated and anonymised – for the use of members and non-members, and the provision of features associated with the movement of goods across borders, such as the despatch of a pre-paid return item.

## Legal bases of the Processing

The processing activities performed by IPC as described above are justified on the ground of the following legal bases:

(i) the processing is necessary for the **performance of a contract** between IPC and you or for the performance of a service requested by you, for example, when you register on IPC' s Sites for our services or to receive our newsletter (Article 6, 1, (b) of the GDPR); 

(ii) the processing is necessary for the purposes of the **legitimate interests** pursued by IPC (or third parties to whom personal data may be disclosed) without being overridden by your own interests and fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6, 1, (f) of the GDPR); such legitimate interests may notably encompass processing your personal data to respond to a query or request for information from you, e.g. to process your requests for information and/or comments on our services, for asking your feedback about your experience of our services, and, to the extent that you allow it, to inform you about services in which you are likely to be interested (e.g. to receive news updates from us); to support our members and non-members; to generate, extract, anonymize and process non-personally identifiable information to provide reporting and statistics on mail services;

(iii) the processing is necessary for **compliance with a legal obligation** to which IPC is subject (Article 6, 1, (c) of the GDPR) ; or

(iv) we have obtained your **prior consent** to the processing where such consent is required by law, such as to send you promotional communications about IPC.

If you do not provide the above mentioned personal data, we may not be able to provide you with the services you request from us.

## Sharing of Personal Data

Personal data related to the movement of letters and goods across borders is originated by a particular member/non-member and is destined to a particular member/non-member. IPC stores and processes this data and may appoint, after security vetting and signature of a contract with the necessary Data Protection safeguards, suppliers to process the data on its behalf. 

When required to achieve the above purposes and grounded on the legal bases described above, IPC may share Personal Data with:

(i) third party services providers acting on our behalf and under our instructions, that provide services to us, in particular web-related services providers and other IT services providers [located in the European Economic Area];

(ii) IPC members and non-member postal operators that have a legitimate interest to receive such information (in particular, reports and analytics) in relation to the performance of postal services;   
Except as expressly set forth herein, IPC shall not provide Personal Data about you to other third parties without obtaining your prior permission, unless it is required to do so under a statutory provision or court order. In particular, IPC may disclose Personal Data about you in the following circumstances:

(i) to respond to authorized information requests from law enforcement authorities or the judiciary or when otherwise required or permitted by law;

(ii) to respond to an emergency; or 

(iii) otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, visitors to the Sites or the public.

The above recipients shall be located within the European Economic Area or another country that is covered by an adequacy decision of the European Commission.

Only a limited number of individuals within IPC (e.g., IPC’s Security Officer, Director Technology, Head of Technology Operations) will be granted access to personal data about you on a need to know basis.

## How we protect Personal Data

IPC takes – and requires that any third party services providers and/or processor processing personal data on behalf and under the instructions of IPC takes – appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data about you against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, and against any other unlawful form of processing of information as defined by applicable Data Protection Laws. 

However, please note that no electronic transmission or storage of information is 100% secure. Therefore, despite the security measures that we have put in place to protect personal data about you, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of data will never occur.

## Links to other websites

Our Sites may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites operate independently from us. We are not responsible for any use of these websites nor for any data processing and privacy practices associated with such websites. We invite you to review these websites' privacy notices if you visit them or provide any personal data to them.

## How we may update this Privacy Policy

Except to the extent limited by applicable law, IPC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, and/or add to all or parts of this Privacy Statement, at any time. Any change to this Privacy Statement will be posted on this page and notified to you by e-mail (where appropriate or required by law and to the extent that we have your e-mail address). We shall indicate at the top of the Privacy Statement the date when it was most recently updated. 

## How long we may keep Personal Data

Personal data about you will not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes identified herein, generally for up to 10 years after the end of the contractual relationship with you (if any), unless shorter or longer retention periods apply as per applicable statutory obligations.

### Right to object

In certain circumstances as defined under applicable law, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of personal data about you by us and we can be required to no longer process personal data about you unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.  You also have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

### Right to withdraw consent

If you have declared your consent for any personal data processing activities as described in this Privacy Statement, you can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to withdrawal of the consent.
