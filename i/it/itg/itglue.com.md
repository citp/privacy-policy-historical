# Privacy Policy | IT Glue

Your privacy is very important to us. IT Glue respects your confidentiality and any information you provide to us will never be sold, shared, or rented to other organizations for commercial purposes.

This Privacy Policy applies to all personal data that may be stored and processed in connection with your use of the Service, and should be read alongside the IT Glue Terms of Service that can be read at <https://www.itglue.com/terms/>. Capitalised words and phrases that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set out in the Terms of Service.

For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is ITG Software Inc., whose head office is at 700 – 128 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC, V6B 1R8, Canada.We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes we make in the future will be posted on our website at <https://www.itglue.com/privacy-policy>. Please check back regularly to see any updates or changes.

You have the following rights as a data subject, by reason of the General Data Protection Regulation:

  * The right to request access to the personal data that we hold about you (also known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * The right to request rectification of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
  * The right to request erasure of the personal data that we hold about you (also known as “the right to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
  * The right to request restriction of processing about you. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * The right to object to processing. Where we are processing your personal data solely on the grounds that there is a legitimate interest to do so, and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground, then this enables you to challenge the processing. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
  * The right to data portability. This enables you to ask us to transfer your personal information to another party in certain circumstances.
  * Where our processing of personal data is based on your having given consent, you also have the right as a data subject to withdraw that consent at any time.
  * You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. In the United Kingdom, the supervisory authority is the Office of the Information Commissioner, full contact details for which can be found at https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/



If you wish to invoke any of the above rights, please contact us using the details set out in Section 12 below. Please include the words DATA PRIVACY REQUEST in the subject line of your email, or at the top of your email or letter.
