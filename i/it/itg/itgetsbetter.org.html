    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: May 10, 2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.	Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This website is owned and operated by the IOLA Foundation d/b/a It Gets Better Project (“ItGetsBetter”) (TM).  By accessing or viewing this website, uploading content to this website, and/or participating in or using any service offered on this website (collectively and individually the “Services”), you agree to this Privacy Policy.  Please review this Privacy Policy carefully as it forms a contract between you and ItGetsBetter.  From time to time, ItGetsBetter may decide to modify, add, or delete portions of this Privacy Policy.  If it does so, your continued use of the Services after any such changes have been made means you agree to such changes.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is part of, ItGetsBetter’s <a href="/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Use located here (“Terms of Use”)</a>, which also govern your use of the Services.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the definitions provided in the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.	Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter collects and stores information that you enter in connection with the Services.  To use some services, ItGetsBetter may collect limited personal information that can identify you or that can be used with other sources of information to identify you (“Personal Information”).  For example, the “Share Your Story” and “Take the Pledge” services require you to submit your email address, name, and zip code, and the “Contribute Online” service requires similar information as well as payment information such as your address and credit card number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.	Anonymous Information</strong></p>
<p>When you use the website, ItGetsBetter may also collect certain information that does not identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”).  For example, ItGetsBetter may collect your IP address, browser information and website domain name every time you use the Services.  ItGetsBetter may also collect information regarding user-traffic patterns and website usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.	Use of Cookies and Spyware</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter does not use or install spyware on your computer.  ItGetsBetter does not use spyware to retrieve information from your computer.  Like many websites, ItGetsBetter uses “cookies,” which are files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your browser. Cookies help ItGetsBetter identify users and optimize their website experience.  Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them.  ItGetsBetter recommends that you leave cookies enabled so it can offer you a better website experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.	Use of Your Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1.	Use of Anonymous Information</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter may use Anonymous Information to help it determine how its users interact with parts of the Services so it can improve the Services and make them more useful.  ItGetsBetter may also use or share with others Anonymous Information in any other manner that ItGetsBetter deems appropriate or necessary.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.	Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter’s Use of Your Personal Information.</p>
<p>ItGetsBetter may use your Personal Information to contact you about programs and opportunities related to the mission of ItGetsBetter.  For example, ItGetsBetter may use your Personal Information to contact you about new offers, newsletters, action alerts, press releases, information about ItGetsBetter programs, volunteer opportunities and donation appeals.</p>
<p>Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties</p>
<p>ItGetsBetter may share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties that are trusted, like-minded organizations.  ItGetsBetter may also exchange its support contact list for other non-profit organizations’ lists for targeted uses.  These practices are intended to allow ItGetsBetter and trusted, like-minded organizations to communicate with a broader audience about community events, policy concerns, fundraising endeavors, and other information that is likely to be of shared interest.</p>
<p>You may opt out from having ItGetsBetter share your Personal Information to non-affiliated third parties by sending ItGetsBetter an email with “Opt Out of Third Party Sharing” in the subject line to <a href="mailto:info@itgetsbetter.org">info@itgetsbetter.org</a>.</p>
<p>Third Party Agents</p>
<p>ItGetsBetter occasionally has third party agents that perform functions on its behalf, such as marketing, website development or hosting, web analytics, credit card processing, and fraud protection.  These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information.  They are contractually restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the website.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.	Public Forums</strong></p>
<p>When you contribute to a public area of this website, such as when you upload User Content, the User Content that you submit will be made available to the general public and will not be considered “Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy.  Accordingly, ItGetsBetter recommends that you use caution when submitting any sensitive information such as your full name, home address, phone number, or other information that would enable users to locate you or information about you.  ItGetsBetter also recommends that you preview all User Content prior to submitting it to ensure it contains no information that you are not comfortable sharing.  ItGetsBetter does not make Personal Information publicly available in connection with your User Submissions.</p>
<p><strong>5.4.	Legally Compelled Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter may disclose Personal Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so under law (and/or under a reasonable interpretation of the law), including, without limitation, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>
<p><strong>5.5.	Emergency Situations</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) conform to applicable law; (ii) protect and defend its rights or property, the website or its users, and (iii) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of ItGetsBetter, its users, and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.	Links and Other Websites</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only applies to the information collected while you are on the ItGetsBetter website.  The ItGetsBetter website may contain links to other websites.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that may be collected on those other websites.  For example, if you upload or share a video on this website, you must do so by means of your YouTube account.  Accordingly, when you are on the YouTube website, you are subject to YouTube’s privacy policy.  ItGetsBetter has no responsibility for the information that may be collected on other websites.  Accordingly, you should use common sense as you navigate the web, be aware when you leave this website, and read the applicable legal documents for each website you visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.	Transfer in the Event of Reorganization</strong></p>
<p>In the event that ItGetsBetter, any affiliate of ItGetsBetter, or substantially all of its assets, are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. For purposes of this policy, an “affiliate” of ItGetsBetter is an entity that is under the control of, or under common control with, ItGetsBetter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.	Security</strong></p>
<p>ItGetsBetter implements and maintains reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.  You understand and agree, however, that no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of ItGetsBetter to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, including in the case of your contacting ItGetsBetter by email or a “contact us” or similar feature on this website. Accordingly, though ItGetsBetter may take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to the Services, due to the nature of the internet, ItGetsBetter cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on its system or otherwise in its care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.  Storage and security of video User Content and any metadata associated therewith, is pursuant to YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you receive an email or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information that seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at <a href="mailto:info@itgetsbetter.org">info@itgetsbetter.org</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.	Users</strong></p>
<p>This website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.  ItGetsBetter does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you must immediately discontinue use of this website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.	Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy will be interpreted under the laws of the United States of America.  To the extent you are accessing this website from outside of the United States of America, you do so at your own risk. If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the other countries to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit Personal Information to ItGetsBetter, you consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.	Your California Privacy Rights.</strong></p>

To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@itgetsbetter.org">info@itgetsbetter.org</a> and include the phrase “1798.83 Privacy Request” in the email subject line.</p>
