### **Italy Chronicles’ Privacy Statement**

**Who We Are**

ItalyChronicles.com is run by Alex Roe who is based in Milan, Italy. You can contact him here: [Contact](http://italychronicles.com/contact/)

**Data Breaches Detected**

None – 24 May 2018.

#### **Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, ItalyChronicles.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ItalyChronicles.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ItalyChronicles.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ItalyChronicles.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ItalyChronicles.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ItalyChronicles.com does not use such information to identify its visitors however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

#### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ItalyChronicles.com’s website choose to interact with ItalyChronicles.com in ways that require ItalyChronicles.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ItalyChronicles.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, I ask visitors who use my commenting system when it is active to provide a name and email address. In each case, ItalyChronicles.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ItalyChronicles.com.

ItalyChronicles.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Where we send your data**

In the course of the operation of this website, web analytics data may be transferred to Google.com. This data has been anonymised using the Google Analytics [ga(‘set’, ‘anonymizeIp’, true)](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#anonymizeIp) feature. Furthermore, data added by visitors adding comments or by using this site’s contact system will be contained in a database located in the United Kingdom (in London) which is where this website is hosted. The group behind the hosting company is StudioPress which has an excellent reputation for security. Indeed, this site is protected by a security system that is always on except on rare occasions when the system is temporarily deactivated for technical reasons. The security system reactivates itself if it is not reactivated manually.

In addition, this website uses an https connection for the secure processing of user data as well as to protect visitor privacy and provide added security.

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

Backup copies of this website are carried out by Automattic’s VaultPress service.

**How we protect your data**

Google Analytics data is anonymised. Other data is encrypted using https. Security systems provided by this website’s hosting service help prevent unauthorised access to this website’s data.

In the event of a data breach, italychronicles.com’s owner Alex Roe will be advised by this website’s hosting company. If identifiable personal data has been taken in the period after 24 May 2018, all reasonable attempts will be taken to notify users or visitors affected either via email or via a message that will appear on this page.

In addition, to find out what, if any, personally identifiable data has been taken, the [Privacy Centre](http://italychronicles.com/privacy-2/) can be used to find out, what, if any, personally identifiable data relating to a visitor or user of this website has been acquired.

**What third parties we receive data from**

ItalyChronicles.com may used data from Amazon Afilliates schemes to determine the content of new posts. The data is interpreted manually, and does not contain any personally identifiable information. To determine what data Amazon,com and Amazon.co.uk holds on you, contact Amazon.

**What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data**

Automated decision making is used by the website’s top ten posts system which monitors post views and adjusts the list of the most popular posts. No personally identifiable information is collected during the process.

Automated decision making is used by this website’s related post system which is provided by Contextly, a third party service. [Contextly’s privacy policy is here](https://contextly.com/privacy/).

**Comments**

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
