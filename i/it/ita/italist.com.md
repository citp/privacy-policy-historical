And while it is necessary for us to collect certain personal information, we respect and protect your right to privacy as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to our websites (including italist.com), any mobile applications and related services (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites to which we link.

## INFORMATION COLLECTED

User Provided Information

Registration with us is mandatory in order to place orders and fully use the Services. During the registration process (whether on our website or through downloading the mobile application), we collect personal information such as your name, email address or social media username. Once you register, you have opted in to receive electronic communications from us.

We also collect personal information when you choose to use certain other aspects of the Services, such as making purchases; subscribing to our newsletter; electing to receive text messages about upcoming boutiques, promotions or events; or if you provide it in response to surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other requests. When you choose to use these additional features, we may require you to provide additional personal information such as your phone number, billing and shipping addresses and credit card information, and we may request additional personal information such as your shopping preferences and demographics.

We may collect other information that you submit to us or that you have consented to permit us to collect or third parties to share with us from time to time.

Automatically Collected Information

In addition, we automatically gather certain information about your use of the Services, such as your IP address, operating system, browser type and a date/stamp time for your visit. If you use our mobile applications, this may include information such as the GPS data (i.e., geolocation data) and device information for the hand-held mobile device on which the mobile application is installed. We may also access your calendar to enable us to create and modify events on your behalf. We may also collect other information that you have consented to permit your mobile phone or application to share with us from time to time.

We may also gather information about how you interact with the Services, such as how frequently certain areas of our website or mobile application are visited, what products are reviewed and selected, order history, shipping program status, and other site navigation data and patterns. This information helps us to understand your interests and which aspects of our Services you find interesting.

Involvement of Others in Data Collection

We may work with third parties to collect and analyze the information as described above and for other purposes described below.

If you access our Services through other websites on which we have "stores," we will collect and analyze the information described above that is obtained through your interaction with that website. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via other aspects of the Service. You are also subject to such "store's" terms of use and privacy policy in connection with these Services.

If you access our Services with your login credentials from a social networking site (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) or if you otherwise agree to associate your italist account with a social networking account (e.g., Instagram or Pinterest), we may receive personal information about you from such social networking site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of the social networking site. For example, Facebook may share with us your friend list, birthday, information about the interests of you or your friends or other personal information, in order to help us establish your account, tailor the Services to you and find other current or potential Service users that you know. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via other aspects of the Service. You are also subject to the social networking site's terms of use and privacy policy.
