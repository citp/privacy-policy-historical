<h4 id="privacy07">7. Sharing</h4>
<p>We sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to personally identifiable information. We also partner with third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We will not voluntarily disclose any information about individual users to third parties, except as described in this privacy policy, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of CareerJunction and its partner sites.</p>
<p>CareerJunction maintains relationships with outside service providers for some of the services offered through our site, for example PayU and Virtual Card Services (VCS).</p>
<p>The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format, where the CareerJunction border will surround the pages served by the service provider, or where pages have the look and feel of CareerJunction. In either case, the service provider is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on those framed pages is provided directly to those service providers, not to <a href="http://www.careerjunction.co.za">http://www.careerjunction.co.za</a> and is subject to their security and privacy policies.
