Such information is not gathered for association with identified interested parties but, by its nature, might allow users to be identified via further processing and association with information held by third parties.

Cookies are not used for the transmission of personal information and no persistent cookies (systems for tracking users) of any kind are used. 

The use of session cookies (which are not saved in a persistent manner on the user's computer and vanish when the browser is closed) is strictly limited to the transmission of the ID session (random number generated by the server) required for the safe and efficient browsing of the website. 

The session cookies used by this website do not make recourse to other IT techniques that might be detrimental to the privacy of browsing by users, and they do not allow the acquisition of personal data identifying the user.
