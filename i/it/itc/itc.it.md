Drupal - Session cookies  
Session cookies enable the website you are visiting to keep track of your movement from page to page so you don't get asked for the same information you've already given to the site. Sessions are established on the server by generating a unique identifier for a request and assigning this id to a persistent data store, ie. a record in a database table. This id is returned with the response and the browser accepts a contract to return this id to the server with every subsequent request. Usually the browser accomplishes this by means of a session cookie which, unlike normal cookies, will not be stored on the client, and are destroyed when the browser application exits. Instead of transferring sensitive information between client and server on every request--which could be exposed to prying eyes--the data is stored securely on the server, and only the identifying session id is transferred. Browsers follow an agreement to only return cookies to the server from whence they came and this data will not be shared between domains. In turn the server agrees to only expose session data to the identifying request and not to make this data available to other active sessions or i.o.w. other users currently with active sessions.
