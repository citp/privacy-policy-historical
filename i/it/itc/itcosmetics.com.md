**IT Cosmetics, LLC (the “IT Cosmetics”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Company’s website at**[www.itcosmetics.com](http://www.itcosmetics.com/)  **(the “Website”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.**

### 1\. **What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers IT Cosmetics’ treatment of personal information that IT Cosmetics collects when you access its Website or mobile services. IT Cosmetics’ Website and mobile services are intended for a US audience, and are governed under the laws of the United States. Do not use our Website or mobile services if you do not agree to the transfer and processing of your personal information by IT Cosmetics in the United States.

This policy does not apply to the practices of third party companies that IT Cosmetics does not own or control, to third party websites (even if linked to the Website), or to individuals that IT Cosmetics does not employ or manage. The Website contains links to other sites. IT Cosmetics is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information to public areas on the Website or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public.

### 2\. **What Personal Information Does IT Cosmetics Collect?**

As described in further detail below, IT Cosmetics may collect personal information from visitors to our Website or mobile services directly when someone signs up for our newsletter, creates an account on our Website, purchases our products, or otherwise contacts us. We may also collect information automatically through the use of cookies or other similar technologies. This information enables us to personalize and improve our services and your experience online, for marketing and promotional purposes, and to process customer orders and fulfill other customer requests.

_**Information You Provide to Us:**_ **** We receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way, including Personal Information you provide to us in registration or to complete an order on the Website, such as your name, birthday, email address, billing address, shipping address, and credit card number, as well as any information on your favorite products or other cosmetic preferences to personalize your experience. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.

_**Information Automatically Collected** : _ We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or obtain services from us. The types of information collected may include, without limitation, technical information such as the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet, the date and time you access the Website, the pages you access, and the internet address of the Website, if any, from which you linked directly to the Website, and other information about your use and interaction with our Website and mobile services.  Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. We use this information to facilitate the operation of our Website and mobile services, to personalize your online experience, and to improve our products and services. As part of this use of information, we may also provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Website and mobile services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Aggregate information would not identify you personally.

**_Cookies and other Tracking Technologies:_** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are automatically transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser, tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people, and to enable certain features on our Website and mobile services. IT Cosmetics and its third party service providers use cookies and other tracking technologies over time on our Website as well as across the web to help facilitate site features, deliver customized advertising, and to personalize your experience. Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol is not yet established, the choices we offer will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy independent of any Do-Not-Track signals.  

We also may use cookies and other technologies to receive confirmation when you open an email from us, if your computer supports this type of program. IT Cosmetics uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. 

 Most browsers have an option to reject or disable cookies, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you elect to disable cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website’s most attractive features.

**_Children’s Privacy._** IT Cosmetics’ Website and mobile services are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that a child under the age of 13 has registered for our Website, we will delete that information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at info@itcosmetics.com.
