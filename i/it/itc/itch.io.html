<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We at Itch Corp. (“<strong>Company</strong>”, “<strong>We</strong>”, or “<strong>Itch.io</strong>”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect or that you may provide when you purchase, download, install, register with, access, or use the Itch.io application (the “App”) or website (the “Website” and collectively with the App, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).

<p>We utilize payment processors who have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing information on or through them.</p>

<p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat your information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not download, register with, or use this Service.
