<h2>What Personal Information Does itDuzzit.com Gather?</h2>

<p>Here are the types of information we gather:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>General Information You Give Us:</b> When you register we ask for information such as your name
     and email address, and store any information you enter on itDuzzit.com or
     give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain
     information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of
     our features.</li>
 <li><b>Authentication Information You Give Us:</b> You may choose to use itDuzzit.com to
     make connections to accounts you have in other applications.  Typically, you will need
     to provide authentication information that enables itDuzzit to connect to these
     applications on your behalf.  itDuzzit.com stores authentication data you enter for
     your other applications, and you may subsequently update, changed, or delete the
     authentication data you have entered.  Once you have authenticated to another application,
     itDuzzit on your behalf may have access to retrieve and modify data in that application.</li>
 <li><b>Automatic Information:</b> We receive and store certain types of information 
     whenever you interact with us, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware
     attributes, and the page being requested. </li>
 <li><b>E-mail Communications:</b> We may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from itDuzzit.com if
     your computer supports such capabilities.</li>
 <li><b>Information from Other
     Sources:</b> We might receive information about you from other
     sources and add it to your account information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>We use this information to:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fulfill your order(s)</li>
 <li>Send you order confirmation(s)</li>
 <li>Assess the needs of your business to determine suitable products</li>
 <li>Send you requested product or service information</li>
 <li>Send product update notifications</li>
 <li>Respond to customer service requests</li>
 <li>Administer your account</li>
 <li>Respond to your questions and concerns</li>
 <li>Improve our web site and marketing efforts</li>
 <li>Conduct research and analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For 
instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally,  
you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to 
receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account by logging into www.itduzzit.com with your 
itDuzzit.com username and password, clicking on "Account", and then clicking on "Cancel Account".</p>

<h2>What About Cookies?</h2>

<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to your computer's hard drive through your
Web browser. itDuzzit.com sets and accesses itDuzzit.com cookies on your computer. This enables
itDuzzit.com to recognize you and your browser, and to enable you to access
duzzits and data that you have created on itDuzzit.com.</p>

<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell
you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
altogether. However, as cookies are required by itDuzzit.com, if you block 
or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use the site.</p>

<h2>Does itDuzzit.com Share the Information It Receives?</h2>

<p>itDuzzit.com is not in the business of selling information
about our customers to others. We share information only as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>itDuzzit.com Partners:</b>
     We may provide information to trusted partners working on behalf of
     or with itDuzzit.com under confidentiality agreements. These companies do not have any
     independent right to share this information.</li>
 <li><b>Business Transfers:</b>
     As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries or
     business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is
     one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises
     made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
     consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that itDuzzit.com or
     substantially all itDuzzit.com assets are acquired, customer information
     will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
 <li><b>Protection of itDuzzit.com and Others:</b>
     We release account and other personal information
     when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law such as to comply
     with a subpoena; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect 
     the rights, property, or safety of itDuzzit.com, our users, or others. This includes
     exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
     protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not
     include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally
     identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in
     violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
 <li><b>With Your Consent:</b>
     Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you
     might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not
     to share the information.</li>
</ul>

Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with,
view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. itDuzzit.com does not provide any 
personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted
advertisement.  If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving 
you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a>.  
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to 
receive generic ads. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement, you are 
consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet 
the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.</p>

<h2>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to
employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that
information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their
jobs.</p>

information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software,
which encrypts information you input.</p>

<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized
access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished
using a shared computer.</p>

<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or 
as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request 
that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us 
<a href="http://www.itduzzit.com/duzz/contact-privacy">here</a>.

to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer
information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.</p>

advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send
(or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly
to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.

or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of
their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or
control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information
practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by
this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about
their privacy practices.</p>

<p>itDuzzit.com may also display personalized third-party
advertising based on personal information about customers. Although itDuzzit.com does not provide any
personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving
companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized
advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in
the northwestern United States).</p>
