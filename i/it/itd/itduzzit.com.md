Typically, you will need to provide authentication information that enables itDuzzit to connect to these applications on your behalf. itDuzzit.com stores authentication data you enter for your other applications, and you may subsequently update, changed, or delete the authentication data you have entered. Once you have authenticated to another application, itDuzzit on your behalf may have access to retrieve and modify data in that application.
  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page being requested. 
  * **E-mail Communications:** We may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from itDuzzit.com if your computer supports such capabilities.
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information.



## We use this information to:

If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account by logging into www.itduzzit.com with your itDuzzit.com username and password, clicking on "Account", and then clicking on "Cancel Account".

## What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. itDuzzit.com sets and accesses itDuzzit.com cookies on your computer. This enables itDuzzit.com to recognize you and your browser, and to enable you to access duzzits and data that you have created on itDuzzit.com.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, as cookies are required by itDuzzit.com, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use the site.

## Does itDuzzit.com Share the Information It Receives?

itDuzzit.com is not in the business of selling information about our customers to others. We share information only as follows:

  * **itDuzzit.com Partners:** We may provide information to trusted partners working on behalf of or with itDuzzit.com under confidentiality agreements. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that itDuzzit.com or substantially all itDuzzit.com assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * **Protection of itDuzzit.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law such as to comply with a subpoena; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of itDuzzit.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.



itDuzzit.com may display targeted advertisements based upon personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. itDuzzit.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/).

## How Secure Is Information About Me?

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

itDuzzit.com works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us [here](http://www.itduzzit.com/duzz/contact-privacy). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?

itDuzzit.com may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.

These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

itDuzzit.com may also display personalized third-party advertising based on personal information about customers. Although itDuzzit.com does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States).
