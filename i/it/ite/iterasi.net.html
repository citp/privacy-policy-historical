	<h3>
	What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?
	</h3> 
	<p>
	ITERASI has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  This Privacy Policy discloses 
	ITERASI’s information gathering and dissemination practices for this website – www.iterasi.net (the “Site”).  By using this Site, you 
	agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
	</p>

	<h3>
	What information do we collect from users and how is it used?
	</h3> 

	<p>
	ITERASI is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in 
	ways that are different from what is disclosed in this policy.  
	</p>
	<p>
	ITERASI collects information from our users at several different points on our Site.
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Registration</u><br>
	Before you can post content on the Site or participate on the Site, we ask that you register with ITERASI and provide to us your 
	Username, E-mail address, Password, Password Prompt Question and Answer. We request this information in order to verify compliance 
	with the Terms of Service and federal, state and local laws and for identification purposes.
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Surveys &amp; Contests</u><br>
	From time-to-time, our Site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is 
	completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may 
	include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact 
	information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
	improving the use and satisfaction of this Site.
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Correspondence</u><br>
	If you correspond with us via e-mail, we may gather the information in a file specific to you.
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>URL and IP address</u><br>
	Like many other websites, ITERASI collects information about users' utilization and navigation of our Site. This information helps us 
	to design our Site to better suit our users' needs. For example, our Site will track the URL that you visited before you came to our 
	Site, the URL to which you next go and your Internet Provider (IP) address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our 
	server and to administer our Site. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. 
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Cookies</u><br>
	Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while visiting a Site. 
	Like most major websites, ITERASI uses cookies on certain pages of our Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other 
	things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you've registered, which 
	allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/log in ID less frequently while 
	visiting our Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Our cookies do not contain any content 
	specific information. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information although cookies may enable us to relate your 
	use of our  Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted. For example, it enables us to enhance 
	personalization on the Site, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. We will always given the choice of opting out 
	of receiving a cookie by checking the appropriate box. However, if you decide to opt out, your use of the Site may be slowed because 
	you will have to enter your log in ID and password at every session. 
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Google Adsense</u><br>
	We use third-party advertising companies, including Google AdSense, to serve ads when you visit our website. 
	These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) 
	about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 
	</p>
	<p style="padding-left:30px">
	Google, as a third party ad vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. 
	Google uses technology known as the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" target="_blank">DoubleClick DART cookie</a> to serve ads to you based on their visit to 
	your sites and other sites on the Internet.
	</p>

	<p style="padding-left:30px">
	If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this 
	information used by these companies, visit the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>. 
	</p>

	<p>
	We only collect the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us. While we may gather market data from other resources, 
	the scope of our knowledge about Personally Identifiable Information based upon your use of our Site is entirely up to you. The 
	information you give us allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve 
	our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content, layout and services. However, for these purposes, we only use

	What security measures does the Site employ?
	</h3>

	that encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us <b>and before we present stored information to you</b>.  In addition, 
	ITERASI uses standard industry practice to protect all of the visitor data we collect against unauthorized access. However, you 
	should keep in mind that this Site and our services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time 
	to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.  When users submit sensitive 
	information via the Site, your information is protected both on-line and off-line.
	</p>

	</h3>

	<p>
