<h3>
	What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	ITERASI has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  This Privacy Policy discloses<br>
	ITERASI’s information gathering and dissemination practices for this website – www.iterasi.net (the “Site”).  By using this Site, you<br>
	agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
	</p>
<h3>
	What information do we collect from users and how is it used?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	ITERASI is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in<br>
	ways that are different from what is disclosed in this policy.
	</p>
<p>
	ITERASI collects information from our users at several different points on our Site.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Registration</u><br><br>
	Before you can post content on the Site or participate on the Site, we ask that you register with ITERASI and provide to us your<br>
	Username, E-mail address, Password, Password Prompt Question and Answer. We request this information in order to verify compliance<br>
	with the Terms of Service and federal, state and local laws and for identification purposes.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Surveys &amp; Contests</u><br><br>
	From time-to-time, our Site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is<br>
	completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may<br>
	include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact<br>
	information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or<br>
	improving the use and satisfaction of this Site.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Correspondence</u><br><br>
	If you correspond with us via e-mail, we may gather the information in a file specific to you.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>URL and IP address</u><br><br>
	Like many other websites, ITERASI collects information about users’ utilization and navigation of our Site. This information helps us<br>
	to design our Site to better suit our users’ needs. For example, our Site will track the URL that you visited before you came to our<br>
	Site, the URL to which you next go and your Internet Provider (IP) address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our<br>
	server and to administer our Site. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Cookies</u><br><br>
	Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes while visiting a Site.<br>
	Like most major websites, ITERASI uses cookies on certain pages of our Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other<br>
	things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you’ve registered, which<br>
	allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/log in ID less frequently while<br>
	visiting our Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Our cookies do not contain any content<br>
	specific information. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information although cookies may enable us to relate your<br>
	use of our  Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted. For example, it enables us to enhance<br>
	personalization on the Site, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. We will always given the choice of opting out<br>
	of receiving a cookie by checking the appropriate box. However, if you decide to opt out, your use of the Site may be slowed because<br>
	you will have to enter your log in ID and password at every session.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><u>Google Adsense</u><br> <br>
	We use third-party advertising companies, including Google AdSense, to serve ads when you visit our website.<br>
	These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number)<br>
	about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px">
	Google, as a third party ad vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.<br>
	Google uses technology known as the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" target="_blank">DoubleClick DART cookie</a> to serve ads to you based on their visit to<br>
	your sites and other sites on the Internet.
	</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px">
	If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this<br>
	information used by these companies, visit the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
	</p>
<p>
	We only collect the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us. While we may gather market data from other resources,<br>
	the scope of our knowledge about Personally Identifiable Information based upon your use of our Site is entirely up to you. The<br>
	information you give us allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve<br>
	our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content, layout and services. However, for these purposes, we only use<br>
	your personal information on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.
	</p>
<h3>
	To whom does ITERASI disclose personal information?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	As a general rule, ITERASI will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose any of your personal data except when we have your<br>
	permission. However, ITERASI may disclose personal data in the following ways:
	</p>
<p>
	We may disclose your personal data to our third party contractors who perform services for ITERASI in order to complete or confirm<br>
	your transaction.  These contractors are permitted to use the personal data only for the purposes of such services.
	</p>
<p>
	We may gather aggregated data about you and disclose the results of such aggregated information to advertisers and for marketing or<br>
	promotional purposes. In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally<br>
	identify you.  Certain information, such as your password, are not disclosed to marketing advertisers in aggregate at all.
	</p>
<p>
	ITERASI may disclose the information obtained from you through this Site as part of a merger, acquisition or other sale of its assets<br>
	or business.
	</p>
<p>
	Moreover, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances, such<br>
	as illegal activity on our Site. ITERASI reserves the right to release personally identifiable information to law enforcement or<br>
	other government officials, as ITERASI, in our sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate.
	</p>
<p>
	Please be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the<br>
	Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
	</p>
<h3>
	How does a customer ‘opt-out’ of ITERASI promotional E-mail?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional E-mail at the time of registration. Promotional E-mail does<br>
	not include E-mail necessary for our Site’s services.  We ask that a customer uncheck a box to receive E-mail about special offers on<br>
	the registration form or at a later time, by contacting us at info@iterasi.com.
	</p>
<h3>
	What are the policies of linked Sites and other third parties?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. You should be aware that when you are<br>
	on the Site, you can be directed to other Sites that are beyond our control and ITERASI is not responsible for the privacy practices<br>
	of third parties or the content of linked Sites.  We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any<br>
	website.
	</p>
<h3>
	What security measures does the Site employ?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through use of this Site, ITERASI uses industry-standard, secure server software<br>
	that encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us <b>and before we present stored information to you</b>.  In addition,<br>
	ITERASI uses standard industry practice to protect all of the visitor data we collect against unauthorized access. However, you<br>
	should keep in mind that this Site and our services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time<br>
	to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.  When users submit sensitive<br>
	information via the Site, your information is protected both on-line and off-line.
	</p>
<h3>
	How can you correct or update your personally identifiable information?<br>
	</h3>

	You may view, correct or update your Personally Identifiable Information in our database that was provided by you by visiting the<br>
	following URL: www.iterasi.net and clicking on Log in.  For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons<br>
	such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement.
	</p>
<h3>
	How will I know about changes in the Privacy Policy?<br>
	</h3>
<p>
	ITERASI reserves the right to update this privacy policy from time to time. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be<br>
	apprised of any changes.  However, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy that<br>
	was in effect at the time the information was collected.  If at any point we should decide to use that information differently, we<br>
	will notify users by way of E-mail so that users can approve or disapprove of such use.
	</p>
