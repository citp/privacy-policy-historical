# Iterable Privacy Policy – Iterable

This Privacy Policy covers Iterable, Inc.’s (“Iterable”, “us”, or “we”) treatment of Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and how it may be gathered on the website located at [https://iterable.com](https://iterable.com/), any other applications and features (collectively, the “Site”), through the use of the services (the “Services”) and any PII customers and business partners share with Iterable. These privacy practices apply to Iterable’s customers and any internet users that visit the websites, applications or other features offered by Iterable’s customers (collectively, “Customer Sites”).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Any order forms or additional agreements to which users and customers agree, governing the provision of Iterable features, shall take precedence over the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the extent of any differences.

#### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMER SITE END USERS

This section describes our policies for internet users that visit Customer Sites.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ITERABLE**

In the course of providing the Services to our customers, Iterable collects both non-PII and PII about end users of Customer Sites. Iterable will not collect your password for any Customer Site or credit card information you have supplied to any Customer Site. We do not purchase or receive information about you from third parties (other than our customers).

Iterable also collects non-PII from Customer Sites you visit, including the following types of data:

Standard Data – common information found in every communication sent over the internet. Using this information, Iterable can infer information such as browser type (e.g., Google Chrome, Apple Safari); operating system (e.g,. Apple macOS or Microsoft Windows); browser language (e.g., Javascript); and internet service provider (e.g., AT&T or ComCast).

Clickstream Data – Iterable can infer how you use our Customer Sites and various pages on the internet.

**COOKIES**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser, tell us how and when pages on our Site are visited and by how many people. Like most internet sites, Iterable uses cookies to enhance our users’ and customers’ experience on the internet. These cookies do not collect PII, and we do not combine information collected to obtain additional PII.

Most browsers allow you to prevent new cookies from being accepted, to be notified when you receive a new cookie, or to disable cookies.

**DATA RETENTION**

Cookies set on behalf of Iterable expire after three years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.

**CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS**

The process for individual internet users to review and/or request changes to their PII collected by Iterable is outlined in the Additional Policies section below.

#### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM ITERABLE CUSTOMERS

This section describes our policies for end users of the Iterable Site and Services, Iterable customers, and corporate partners.

**INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US**

We receive and store any information you enter on the Site, through the Services or provide to us in any other way, with your consent. You have the option not to provide us with certain information. We use PII provided by you for such purposes as responding to your Service requests, customizing your content, communicating with you about our products and marketing our Services to you.

Further information may be required if you choose to purchase paid components of the Services, such as billing information. Iterable uses third party partners, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Zuora](https://www.zuora.com/), for credit card processing which may require and store your billing information.

**AUTOMATIC INFORMATION**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Iterable automatically receives and records “traffic data” on our server logs from your computer, including your geographical location and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, Iterable cookie information, and pages you request. Iterable uses this traffic data to analyze trends and administer the Site. Our service automatically collects usage information, such as the frequency of visitors to our Site and their components. This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users utilize different parts of the Site and Services.

**E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS**

Customers may be contacted via email regarding the Iterable Service or Site. For any requests or inquiries made through the[ Iterable Support Center](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), a record of information you provide will be retained in our response message(s). Additionally, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.

**COOKIES**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser, tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. Iterable.com cookies do not collect PII, and do not combine information collected through cookies to obtain PII.

#### SHARING OF PII BY ITERABLE

This section describes our policies for sharing PII received from either Customer Site end users or Iterable end users or customers.

We neither rent nor sell PII to anyone. Except as provided for in any additional agreement you enter into with Iterable, we share your personal information only as described below:

**THIRD PARTY USE OF PII**

Iterable may engage third party companies or individuals to provide the Services. In doing so, we may share PII for the following reasons; billing, processing payments, providing marketing assistance and customer service. These third party companies and individuals provide the same level of privacy protection as Iterable. Additionally, these third parties do not have any right to use PII collected from our Site or Services, beyond what is necessary to assist us.

**PROMOTIONAL OFFERS**

We may send offers to our customers on behalf of other businesses or provide our customers with the opportunity to notify end users directly of promotions by text message or e-mail.

**BUSINESS TRANSFERS**

If Iterable, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, PII would be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Iterable may continue to use your PII as set forth in this policy.

**PROTECTION OF ITERABLE AND OTHERS**

We may release PII when we, in our sole discretion, believe in good faith that release is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, protect the rights, property, or safety of Iterable, our employees, our customers, or others.

#### ADDITIONAL POLICIES

We may receive Customer Data, subject to the Privacy Shield and the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (“GDPR”). Iterable will be liable for all transfers of this Customer Data to a third-party service provider, acting as an agent on our behalf, if both (i) the agent processes the Customer Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and the GDPR, and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
