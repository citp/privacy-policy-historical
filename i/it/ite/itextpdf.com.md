3.4.      Currently iText is working with a marketing automation tool that automatically tracks if you open the email we sent you and click on certain links. Because we think this information is too intrusive, we are not even interested in this, we are investigating the possibilities of other tools. For the time being, we have implemented several data minimization measures (access control, physical security and privileged identity management). You can always contact us to get more detailed information about this.

3.5.      iText websites may include buttons, tools, or content that link to other companies’ services (for example, a Facebook "Like" button).

Please read that company’s privacy policy for more information.
