# ITtoolbox Privacy Policy

  
We at ITtoolbox know you take your privacy seriously. Information about our users is an important part of our business and it is necessary that we collect certain information if users wish to utilize advanced ITtoolbox features. We are not in the business of selling user information to others. We share information only as described below.  
  
**What this Privacy Policy Covers**  
This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that ITtoolbox collects when you are on any ITtoolbox site (e.g. ITtoolbox.com, OpenITx.com, Staffing.ITtoolbox.com), and when you use ITtoolbox services. This policy also covers ITtoolbox treatment of any personally identifiable information that ITtoolbox business partners share with ITtoolbox as well as what happens to personal information in the unlikely event that ITtoolbox sells or transfers its business assets.  
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ITtoolbox does not own or control, or to people that ITtoolbox does not employ or manage.  
  
**Information Collection and Use**  
ITtoolbox is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this privacy statement.  
  
**Creating a User ID**  
ITtoolbox allows members to create User IDs, providing a control for user information that is to be made public or private. This also allows members to identify themselves with their contributions to any ITtoolbox Web site. Each ID is unique to an ITtoolbox Knowledge Base. A User ID is valid for all forums in the community - Knowledge Bank, Job Bank, and General Discussion. During registration, a user is required to provide his or her contact information (such as name and e-mail address). It is optional for the user to provide employment information (such as employment type, employer name and industry); by doing so, we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. Once you register with ITtoolbox and sign in to our services, you are no longer anonymous to ITtoolbox administrators.  
  
**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is, in no way, linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by choosing the _Remember Me_ box when creating a new User ID or logging on, the user does not have to enter his or her password each time he or she visits that Web site. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site.  
Some of our business partners may use cookies within our network. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.  
  
**Log Files**  
To plan resource requirements and measure the success of certain site features, ITtoolbox uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the network, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
  
**Sharing**  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers to measure the success of services and campaigns. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.  
  
**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other IT-related Web sites. Please be aware that ITtoolbox is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by ITtoolbox Web sites.  
  
**Newsletters**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to any ITtoolbox newsletters, we ask for the user’s e-mail address. The user will be notified of receipt through a confirmation e-mail. E-mail addresses provided by users for newsletter subscriptions will not be sold or provided to third parties, except as noted in Business Transfers.

Periodically, ITtoolbox newsletter subscribers may receive ITtoolbox community updates. These messages are sent in order to share information about related ITtoolbox services. No personally identifiable information will be made public to third parties. No spam or off-topic messages will be distributed to the newsletters.  
  
  
**Alerts**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to any ITtoolbox alerts, we ask for the user’s e-mail address. The user will be notified of receipt through a confirmation e-mail message. E-mail addresses provided by users for alert subscriptions will not be sold or provided to third parties, except as noted in Business Transfers.

Periodically, ITtoolbox newsletter subscribers may receive ITtoolbox community updates. These messages are sent in order to share information about related ITtoolbox services. No personally identifiable information will be made public to third parties. No spam or off-topic messages will be distributed to the newsletters.  
  
  
**OpenITx Discussion Groups**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to a discussion group through OpenITx, we ask for the user’s e-mail address. E-mail addresses provided by users for mail list subscriptions will not be sold or provided to third parties, except as noted in Business Transfers.  
Periodically, the discussion groups may receive weekly sponsorship messages and/or ITtoolbox community updates. These messages are sent through ITtoolbox; therefore, no personally identifiable information is made public to third parties. No spam or off-topic messages will be distributed to the discussion groups.  
  
**ITtoolbox Staffing**  
We do not directly contact individual members of our audience regarding ITtoolbox Staffing opportunities unless they have requested that we do so by submitting their resume or applying for a position. We will not sell, loan, or otherwise distribute our resume database, except as noted in Business Transfers.  
  
**Free E-mail**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to ITtoolbox free e-mail, we ask for contact information, such as the user’s name. This contact information will not be sold or provided to third parties, except as noted in Business Transfers.  
  
**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time, our Web site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary; the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, address, and employment type), and demographic information (such as zip code, age). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information may be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this site.  
  
**Recommend this Knowledge Base to a Friend**  
If a user elects to use the ITtoolbox referral service for informing a friend about our Web site, we ask them for the friend’s name and e-mail address. ITtoolbox will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. ITtoolbox uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.  
  
**Security**  
ITtoolbox takes every precaution to protect our users’ privacy. When users submit sensitive information via any ITtoolbox Web site, your information is protected both online and offline.

Your ITtoolbox account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Access to any user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is heavily restricted within our company. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our system administrators) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. In addition, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security of ITtoolbox Web sites, you can send an e-mail to [Info@ITtoolbox.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20031206053241id_/http%3A//www.ittoolbox.com/privacy/info@ittoolbox.com) requesting further information.  
  
  
**Site and Service Updates**  
We may send registered users of ITtoolbox occasional e-mail announcements regarding changes or updates to our services. Users may request removal at any time from our list for any future updates by sending an e-mail to [Leave-ITtoolbox-Announce@OpenITx.com.](https://web.archive.org/web/20031206053241id_/http%3A//www.ittoolbox.com/privacy/Leave-ITtoolbox-Announce@OpenITx.com)  
  
**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as employment type or e-mail address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. To correct/update personal information, provide details of the requested change to [Webmaster@ITtoolbox.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20031206053241id_/http%3A//www.ittoolbox.com/privacy/webmaster@ittoolbox.com).  
  
**Business Transfers**  
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or business assets. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred assets. In the unlikely event that Information Technology Toolbox, Inc., sells Information Technology Toolbox, Inc., or one or more of its properties, user information will be one of the transferred assets.  
  
**With Your Consent**  
Other than as stated above, you will receive notice or be prompted to provide explicit approval when information about you may go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share information.  
  
**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will make these changes available from our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we are authorized to use their information. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
