<p>

<small>We know you take your privacy seriously.  Information about our users is an important 
part of our business and it is necessary that we collect certain information if users wish to 
utilize advanced ITtoolbox features. We are not in the business of selling user information to 
others. We share information only as described below.</small>

</p><p>


<font face="arial"><b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b></font></p><p>
<small>This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that 
ITtoolbox collects when you are on any ITtoolbox site (e.g.&nbsp; ITtoolbox.com, OpenITx.com, 
Staffing.ITtoolbox.com), and when you use ITtoolbox services. This policy also covers ITtoolbox treatment of any personally 
identifiable information that ITtoolbox business partners share with ITtoolbox and what happens 
to personal information in the unlikely event that ITtoolbox sells or transfers its business 
assets. 

</small></p><p><small>

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ITtoolbox does not own or control, 
or to people that ITtoolbox does not employ or manage. 

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Information Collection and Use</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>ITtoolbox is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, 
share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Creating a User ID</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>ITtoolbox allows members to create User IDs, providing a control for user information that is to be 
made public or private. This also allows members to identify themselves with their contributions to any ITtoolbox Web site.  Each ID is unique to an ITtoolbox portal.   A User ID is valid for all forums in the community - Knowledge Bank, Job Bank, and General Discussion.  During registration a user is required to provide his or her contact information (such as name and email address).  It is optional for the user to provide employment information (such as employment type, employer name and industry); by doing so, we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.   Once you register with ITtoolbox and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to ITtoolbox administrators.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Cookies</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about 
the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information 
while on our site.  For instance, by choosing the “Remember Me” box when creating a new User ID 
or logging on, the user does not have to enter their password each time they visit that Web site.  If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site.  

</small>

</p><p>

<small>Some of our business partners may use cookies within our network (for example, 
ITtoolbox Stocks service provider Stockpoint Inc.).  However, we have no access to or control 
over these cookies.</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Log Files</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>In order to track our sites’ usage to plan resource requirements and measure the success 
of certain site features, ITtoolbox uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the network, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to 
personally identifiable information.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Sharing</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers to 
measure the success of services and campaigns. This is not linked to any personal information 
that can identify any individual person.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Links</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ITtoolbox is not 
responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware 
of when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that 
collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to 
information collected by ITtoolbox Web sites.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Newsletters</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>If a user wishes to subscribe to any ITtoolbox newsletters, we ask for the user’s email 
address.  The user will be notified of receipt through a confirmation email.  Email addresses 
provided by users for newsletter subscriptions will not be sold or provided to third parties 
except as noted in Business Transfers.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>OpenITx Mail Lists</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>If a user wishes to subscribe to a mail list through OpenITx, we ask for the user’s 
email address.  Email addresses provided by users for mail list subscriptions will not be sold 
or provided to third parties except as noted in Business Transfers.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>ITtoolbox Staffing</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>We do not directly contact individual members of our audience regarding ITtoolbox Staffing 
opportunities unless they have requested that we do so by submitting their resume or applying for 
a position.    We will not sell, loan, or otherwise distribute our resume database except as
noted in Business Transfers.

</small>

</p><p><font face="arial"><b>Free Email</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>If a user wishes to subscribe to ITtoolbox free email, we ask for contact information, 
such as the user’s name.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a 
choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact 
information (such as name, address, and employment type), and demographic information (such as 
zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  
Survey information may be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction 
with this site.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Recommend This Portal to a Friend</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we 
ask them for the friend’s name and email address.  ITtoolbox will automatically send the friend 
a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  ITtoolbox uses this information for the sole 
purpose of sending this one-time email.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Security</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users 
submit sensitive information via any ITtoolbox Web site, your information is protected both 
online and offline.

</small></p><p><small>

Your ITtoolbox account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. 
Access to any user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
heavily restricted within our company.  Only employees who need the information to perform a 
specific job (for example, our system administrators) are granted access to personally identifiable 
information.  ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  In 
addition, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure 
environment.

</small></p><p><small>

If you have any questions about the security at our Web sites, you can send an email to 
<a href="info@ittoolbox.com">info@ittoolbox.com</a> requesting further information.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Site and Service Updates</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>We may send registered users of ITtoolbox occasional email announcements regarding 
changes or updates to our services.  Users may request removal at any time from our list for 
any future updates by sending an empty email (no subject and no body) to <a href="Leave-ITtoolbox-Announce@openITx.com">Leave-ITtoolbox-Announce@openITx.com</a>.
</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as employment type or 
email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  To correct/update 
personal information, provide details of the requested change to <a href="&#10;webmaster@ittoolbox.com">webmaster@ittoolbox.com</a>.

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Business Transfers</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>As we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell businesses or business 
assets. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred assets. 
In the unlikely event that Information Technology Toolbox, Inc., sells  Information Technology 
Toolbox, Inc., or one or more of its properties , user information will of course be one of the 
transferred assets. 

</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>With Your Consent</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>Other than as stated above, you will receive notice or be prompted to provide explicit 
approval when information about you may go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity 
to choose not to share information.
</small>

</p><p>

<font face="arial"><b>Notification of Changes</b></font>

</p><p>

<small>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will make these changes available from
 our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use 
personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was 
collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or 
not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance 
with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
