				<tbody><tr>
					<td>We at ITtoolbox know you take your privacy seriously. Information about our users is an important 
					part of our business and it is necessary that we collect certain information if users wish to utilize 
					advanced ITtoolbox features. We are not in the business of selling user information to others. We 
					share information only as described below.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b><br>
						This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that ITtoolbox 
						collects when you are on any ITtoolbox site (e.g. ittoolbox.com, Groups.ittoolbox.com, 
						jobcenter.ittoolbox.com), and when you use ITtoolbox services. This policy also covers 
						ITtoolbox's treatment of any personally identifiable information that ITtoolbox business 
						partners share with ITtoolbox as well as what happens to personal information in the unlikely 
						event that ITtoolbox sells or transfers its business assets. This policy does not apply to 
						the practices of companies that ITtoolbox does not own or control, or to people that 
						ITtoolbox does not employ or manage. 
				</td></tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
						ITtoolbox is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, 
						share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this 
						privacy statement. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Creating an ITtoolbox User ID</b><br>
						ITtoolbox enables members to create ITtoolbox User IDs, which allows them to control their 
						personal information and whether it should be made public or private. This also allows members 
						to identify themselves with their contributions to any ITtoolbox Web site and to manage their 
						ITtoolbox e-mail-based subscriptions. During registration, a member is required to provide his 
						or her contact information (such as name, e-mail address, state, country, and zip code), as well 
						as some basis demographic information (such as role, title, business focus/industry, company size, 
						purchasing influence, and company revenue). By doing so, we can provide a more personalized 
						experience on our site. Once you register with ITtoolbox and sign in to our services, you are 
						no longer anonymous to ITtoolbox administrators. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Cookies</b><br>
						A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the 
						user. Cookies that ITtoolbox creates that are stored on the user’s hard drive do not store 
						any personally identifiable information. Some of our business partners may use cookies within 
						our network. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Log Files</b><br>
						To plan resource requirements and measure the success of certain site features, ITtoolbox uses 
						IP addresses to analyze trends, administer to the network, and gather broad demographic 
						information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
						information.
				    </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Sharing</b><br>
						We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers to measure 
						the success of services and campaigns. This is not linked to any personal information that 
						can identify any individual person. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Links</b><br>
						ITtoolbox Web sites contain links to other IT-related Web sites. Please be aware that ITtoolbox 
						is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage our users to be aware 
						when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that 
						collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
						collected by ITtoolbox Web sites.

					<td><br><b>Newsletters</b><br>
						If a user wishes to subscribe to any ITtoolbox newsletters, we ask for the user’s e-mail address.

						users for newsletter subscriptions will not be sold or provided to third parties, except as noted 
						in Business Transfers.

					<td><br><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
						From time-to-time, our Web site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in 
						these surveys or contests is completely voluntary; the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this 
						information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, address, and employment 
						type), and demographic information (such as zip code, age, etc.). Contact information will only be used 
						to notify the winners to award prizes and to send survey results to participants. Survey information may 
						be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this site. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Recommend this ITtoolbox Knowledge Base to a Friend</b><br>
						If a user elects to use the ITtoolbox referral service for informing a friend about our Web site, we ask 
						for the friend’s name and e-mail address. ITtoolbox will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail 
						inviting them to visit the site. ITtoolbox uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this 
						one-time e-mail.

					<td><br><b>Security</b><br>
						ITtoolbox takes every precaution to protect our users’ privacy. When users submit sensitive information 
						via any ITtoolbox Web site, your information is protected both online and offline.
						<br><br>
						Your ITtoolbox account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Access to any 
						user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is heavily restricted within our 
						company. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our system 
						administrators) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept 
						up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. In addition, the servers on which we store personally 
						identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
						<br><br>
						If you have any questions about the security of ITtoolbox Web sites, please contact  
						<a href="/common/contact.asp?m=info"><img src="/images/IttbInfoEml.GIF" alt="info" border="0" style="margin-bottom:-3px"></a>

					<td><br><b>Site and Service Updates</b><br>
						We may send registered users of ITtoolbox occasional e-mail announcements regarding changes or updates 
						to our services. Users may request removal at any time from our list for any future updates by sending 
						an e-mail to <a href="/common/contact.asp?m=leave"><img alt="leave" src="/images/IttbLeave.gif" border="0"></a></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
						If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as employment type or e-mail address), 
						or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or 
						remove that user’s personal data provided to us. To correct/update personal information, please contact
						<a href="/common/contact.asp?m=web"><img alt="Web" src="/images/IttbWebEml.GIF" border="0" style="margin-bottom:-3px"></a>
						with details of the requested change.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
						We treat your personally identifiable information carefully.  We may use personally identifiable information 
						in order to offer services and functionality that are a part of our business.  In accordance, your personally 
						identifiable information will only be made available to other companies in the following circumstances:
						<ul>
						    <li>
						        We have your explicit consent to share such information.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						        We may employ companies to act as our agent to perform specific services on our 
						        behalf.  For instance, we may employ a company to distribute and manage e-mail 
						        messages on our behalf, such as in the case of newsletters and advertisements. 
						        These companies have agreed to keep user information confidential and to use it 
						        only to perform the service(s) we have employed them to perform on our behalf.

					<td><br><b>Business Transfers</b><br>
						As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or business assets. In such 
						transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred assets. In the unlikely event 
						that Information Technology Toolbox, Inc., sells Information Technology Toolbox, Inc., or one or 
						more of its properties, user information will be one of the transferred assets. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>With Your Consent</b><br>
						Other than as stated above, you will receive notice or be prompted to provide explicit approval 
						when information about you may go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose 
						not to share information. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><br><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
						If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will make these changes available from our home 
						page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
						circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable 
						information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify 
						users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we are authorized to use 
						their information. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the 
						information was collected.
