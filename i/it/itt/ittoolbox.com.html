						utilize advanced ITtoolbox features. We are not in the business of selling user information to 
						others. We share information only as described below.</td>
				</tr>

					<td><br><font face="arial"><b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b></font><br>
						This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that 
						ITtoolbox collects when you are on any ITtoolbox site (e.g.&nbsp;ITtoolbox.com, OpenITx.com, 
						Staffing.ITtoolbox.com), and when you use ITtoolbox services. This policy also covers ITtoolbox treatment of any personally 
						identifiable information that ITtoolbox business partners share with ITtoolbox as well as what happens 
						to personal information in the unlikely event that ITtoolbox sells or transfers its business assets.<br>
						This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ITtoolbox does not own or control, 
						or to people that ITtoolbox does not employ or manage.</td>

					<td><br><font face="arial"><b>Creating a User ID</b></font><br>
						ITtoolbox allows members to create User IDs, providing a control for user information that is to be 
						made public or private. This also allows members to identify themselves with their contributions to any ITtoolbox Web site.  
						Each ID is unique to an ITtoolbox Knowledge Base.   
						A User ID is valid for all forums in the community - Knowledge Bank, Job Bank, and General Discussion.  
						During registration, a user is required to provide his or her contact information (such as name and e-mail address).  
						It is optional for the user to provide employment information (such as employment type, employer name and industry); by doing so, we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.
						Once you register with ITtoolbox and sign in to our services, you are no longer anonymous to ITtoolbox administrators.</td>

					<td><br><font face="arial"><b>Cookies</b></font><br>
						A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about 
						the user.  Usage of a cookie is, in no way, linked to any personally identifiable information 
						while on our site.  For instance, by choosing the <i>Remember Me</i> box when creating a new User ID 
						or logging on, the user does not have to enter his or her password each time he or she visits that Web site.  
						If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site.</td>

						personally identifiable information.</td>

						From time-to-time, our Web site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  
						Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary; the user has a 
						choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact 
						information (such as name, address, and employment type), and demographic information (such as

						Your ITtoolbox account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. 
						Access to any user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
						heavily restricted within our company.  Only employees who need the information to perform a 
						specific job (for example, our system administrators) are granted access to personally identifiable 
						information.  ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  In 
						addition, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure 
						environment.<br><br>

					<td><br><font face="arial"><b>Business Transfers</b></font><br>
						As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or business 
						assets. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred assets. 
						In the unlikely event that Information Technology Toolbox, Inc., sells  Information Technology 
						Toolbox, Inc., or one or more of its properties, user information will be one of the 
						transferred assets.</td>
