# ItsYourTurn.com - Privacy policy

  
Your email address is required for registration, and is used to notify you when it's your turn to move. We **will NOT** sell or give out your email address to an outside party under any circumstances. Your email address will not visible to anyone else on our site except you. If you choose to give your email address to your opponent, you may do so by posting a private message with your move. Otherwise, no one visiting this site will have access to your email address, not even your opponents. 

Currently, we don't even sell advertising in our email-- all our email is for the player's benefit (usually notifying you when you have games where it's your turn, tournament notifications, or notices of games won or lost). However, if you set the "email notify" option to "NO", you will not receive any email from us, ever. 

Many players feel more comfortable if they can see a little information about you in your personal profile rather than just a user ID-- for example, the town where you live. However, this information is entirely optional-- you may choose to leave these fields blank. We will absolutely **not** sell this information to a third party as "market research". 

We do use cookies to track your user ID as you move from page to page. This is to prevent you from having to log on repeatedly as you navigate the site. Since you already have to log on, we know who you are, so the use of cookies does not affect your privacy in any way. 

Please do not discuss very sensitive subjects in your messages, even in your private messages. While we do make every effort to maintain the integrity of private messages, we cannot be liable for bugs in the program that may allow outsiders to read private messages. However, it is the policy of ItsYourTurn.com not to monitor, edit or disclose the contents of private messages other than what is technically necessary to process those messages. 

It is our policy not ask for personal information such as your street address or your phone number. Since we do not ask for this information, no one can discover this information via ItsYourTurn.com unless you explicitly post it (we strongly advise against doing this). If anyone asks you for this information claiming to be a representative of It's Your Turn, Inc., please notify us immediately. 

ItsYourTurn.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site.
