Security  
Your information is stored on iTulip.com Web servers hosted by Bluehost (http://www.bluehost.com) a Web hosting company based in the United States.  Bluehost uses various procedural and technical safeguards to protect information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect information, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. Bluehost employs many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.

Privacy of Children  
Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us--including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address.
