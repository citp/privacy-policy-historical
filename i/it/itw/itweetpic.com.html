This data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click.
 For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on.

 We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. 
iTweetpic may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. 
A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site.
 A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. 
</p><p>
We may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within iTweetpic's Sites, Services and Software.

</p><p>
Advertisements
</p><p>
The Services may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. 
These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider. The ad service provider may place or utilize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. iTweetpic is not responsible for the collection of these cookies and is not responsible for the actions of the ad service providers. iTweetpic does not sponsor, endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised by third parties on its site.

We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
