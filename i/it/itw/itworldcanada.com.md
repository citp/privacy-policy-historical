This Online Privacy Statement is a simplified version of IT World Canada's Privacy Policy. It is designed to inform you of our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information you may provide via IT World Canada's Web sites. 

Our Privacy Policy follows the _Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information_ and complies with federal and provincial privacy laws including the federal _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ (PIPEDA). A summary of the ten principles of fair information practices on which the Privacy Policy is based is included at the end of this Privacy Statement.

Please read this Privacy Statement completely before using or submitting information via this site.

You can also contact us at this address if you have a question about IT World Canada's handling of your information, if you wish to obtain a copy of information you have provided to us, or if you become aware that information you have provided is incorrect and would like us to correct it. Before we can provide information or correct any inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and other details that will help us to respond to your request. We will endeavour to respond within a reasonable timeframe.

**CONSENT**  
By using an IT World Canada Web site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Statement. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information, personal or otherwise, as described in this Privacy Statement.

**SITE REGISTRATION**  
The Web site ITWorldCanada.com provides news, news analysis and other information primarily intended to support those engaged professionally in the development, support, management and strategic application of Information and Information Technology (I&IT) in a business environment.

IT World Canada does not charge a fee for visitors to access the site's content; instead, as with many Web sites, revenue is generated through advertising and sponsorships. Our advertisers and sponsors have a reasonable expectation that visitors to the site are genuine and meet certain minimum qualifications in the field we serve. Much of the site's content is, therefore, offered only to registered users. Information collected through the registration process is used by IT World Canada to verify the professional profile of visitors.

**Cookies used in registration**  
As part of the registration process we use a browser feature called a "cookie". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a small text file. The cookie we send as part of the registration process allows the site to recognize that a visitor is a registered user and permit access to restricted sections of the site on future visits.

For a more detailed explanation of our use of cookies, please see the section, _Information We May Place Automatically On Your Computer''s Hard Drive_ , found later in this statement.

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**  


* * *

We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns. Personally identifying information is collected by IT World Canada only when you specifically and knowingly provide it. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**  
Beyond the site registration described previously, IT World Canada collects and uses your personal information primarily for the purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested from us, including the delivery of the publications _CIO Canada, ComputerWorld Canada, Network World Canada and CIO Government Review_ and related content; delivery of electronic or direct-mailed newsletters; and, event registration confirmations, updates and other information related to IT World Canada products, events and seminars.

The information we collect is also used to communicate with you about your subscriptions and to provide you with information related to other IT World Canada and its sister IDG companies and the IDG Network publications and services.

All e-mails sent to subscribers clearly identify the source of the e-mail as IT World Canada, its publications or IDG.

Subscribers may elect not to receive e-mail from third parties when e-mail information is collected, and in response to any e-mail received. Subscribers may change their preferences at any time by e-mail to IT World Canada [circulation@itworldcanada.com](mailto:circulation@itworldcanada.com) or by calling the circulation department at (613) 475-3217

If you have indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from selected IT World Canada sponsors or advertisers, your personal information would also be used by IT World Canada to contact you or to send you e-mail materials and other mailings on their behalf. Your personal information is never shared with third parties. The information submitted by them is fully screened by IT World Canada and must, in our judgement, be of value to the IT Community. However, you always have the option to tell us not to send offers for other products or services. 

If you enter a contest or participate in other promotional activities offered by IT World Canada, your personal information will be used to administer the promotion, including the use of your name and selected other information for the purposes of contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion. 

IT World Canada may also contact you from time to time to conduct research and surveys in our ongoing effort to improve our product and service offerings, or to invite your editorial comments for articles being developed for publication. 

IT World Canada will not release your personal information to a third party without your authorization unless required to by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process serviced on our Web site.

IT World Canada will only ask you to provide personal information that we need, when we need it. We will always explain why we need the information and what we intend to do with it.

We will seek your prior consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifying information and you can refuse such consent. You may also withdraw your consent at a later time by giving us reasonable notice. We will notify you in advance of any change in our intent for the use or disclosure of your personally identifying information. 

Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.

**DISCLOSURE**  
In order to effectively provide the products and services you have requested, IT World Canada may share your personal information with selected third parties who act on our behalf as suppliers or service providers. Examples include bonded mailing houses for processing and labelling items, including publications, prior to mailing; and, Canada Post and other distributors and carriers. We provide only the information required to perform the requested service. Information provided to third parties in these circumstances may only be used for the stated purpose. It is our practice to require third party suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IT World Canada''s policies.

In addition, the information collected to service your subscriptions is made available -- on IT World Canada's premises only -- for review by the Canadian Circulation Audit Bureau (CCAB), the official auditing body for magazines. The auditors may also contact randomly selected subscribers in order to verify the publisher''s circulation statements.

**SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION**  
From time to time we may supplement information you give us via our Web site with information we acquire from other sources, such as information to validate your address, or company information available through sources such as business directories. This is to help us maintain consistency and accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.

Please note, however, that blocking or disabling cookies will limit your access to non-restricted content sections, and erasing cookies will require that you re-register if you wish to access content in restricted sections of the site.
