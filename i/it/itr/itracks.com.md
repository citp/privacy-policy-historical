Itracks Privacy Statement

Interactive Tracking Systems Inc. (hereafter known as Itracks) takes the privacy of those using our sites and products very seriously. Itracks is a provider of online tools for the market research industry. As such, we may from time to time gather information about clients and the public to ensure we are providing the best services possible. All information collected is held with the strictest confidence and is stored within Itracks internal servers. 

To help you protect your privacy, we provide this notice to explain our practices of collecting online information and give you important information about your role in this collection.

What Type of Information is Collected? 

At Itracks.com, the Research Center, and other online products, you may have the option to order products or demos, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services (like our online newsletter), or participate in one of our online forums (Online Focus Group or Bulletin Board Focus Group).

At these pages we may or may not ask for information including name, address, email, phone and fax numbers, corporate information, interest in products/areas, and other information directly related to Itracks' services. You may, in the case of the Research Center, be asked to submit information about other people as well including their name and corporate affiliation for administrative purposes. 

Itracks also collects information that is considered non-personally identifiable, including the type of browser and operating system you are using. This information helps us create the best websites and products for the broadest range of users.

What Does Itracks Do With the Information? 

Itracks uses the information you provide to best fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to adequately respond to inquiries, as well as offering you other Itracks products and services that we have a strong reason to believe may be of interest to you. Information will also be used within the Online Focus Group or Bulletin Board Focus Group forums to facilitate your participation in these services.

Your information will never be passed on to a third party without your express consent. Itracks will also use this information for correspondence purposes (e.g., to let you know about special offers) and to facilitate the dissemination of such products as our online newsletter. The information you provide about others is for the sole purpose of providing access to areas you have predetermined within the Research Center. 

Any content that is submitted for inclusion within our newsletter (e.g., corporate news) may be published with your name and company worked for, unless you explicitly request otherwise. Non-personally identifiable information may be used to help us with the design and content of our site as well as for personalization of some services. This information may be used in the aggregate to analyze aspects of site usage.

Our Policy Concerning Children 

Itracks will never knowingly collect information from any individual under the age of 13 years without the express, written permission from the parents or legal guardian of said child. Itracks adheres to all Canadian, US and International laws regarding Internet use by minors.

Notification of Changes 

Itracks will notify you directly if there are any material changes to this Privacy Statement. Any changes in our privacy statement will be posted 30 days prior to that change.

Links 

Itracks may occasionally offer options that allow visitors to voluntarily link to outside sites. Itracks is not responsible for the content or effect of the privacy policies of these other sites.

Our Commitment to Security 

Itracks has implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access of the information provided. For full details regarding these safeguards please contact [ info@itracks.com](mailto:info@itracks.com).

Legal Notices 

Under the laws of the Government of Canada, we may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

Itracks will take all necessary measures to ensure that there are no unauthorized disclosures of information. However, we cannot assure you that, in unforeseen circumstances, information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Statement. 

Itracks is not in any way responsible for use or misuse of Itracks' tools by clients and/or resellers.
