# Privacy – itison

### Safeguarding your rights

The privacy of our users is important to us and we take care to safeguard it. This policy explains how we use your personal information and elaborates on our Data Protection notice (which is displayed at the point of user registration).

### What information do we collect?

When you register as a user, we will collect the information necessary to provide the service which includes your name and an e-mail address. You will also be asked to provide your location and address, but you can register without providing these details. Once you are registered, you can revisit your profile at any time to amend these details or to provide additional details.

We will also collect information from you if you complete any other forms on our site or if you contact us with comments or specific requests.

### What do we use personal information for?

We want to provide a service which is personalised to each of our visitors. We also want to give you control of what you receive as a result of registering with **itison.com**.

From time to time we may also run deals in partnership with third parties who might then want to contact you. But don’t worry; if they do we’ll always ask your permission first, otherwise we’ll never share your details.

### Information collected automatically

We automatically collect information about your visit to our site. This information is used to make your visit to our site more efficient, and to help us follow browsing preferences on our site so that we can make regular improvements. Our external web host may also automatically log your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.

### Cookies

Like most sites, itison.com uses small text files called cookies to allow you to shop with us and to help us improve your experience.

### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that your browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc) downloads in much the same way as it displays images and video. The cookie allows us to remember certain things about your visit, such as: if you've signed in, what's in your shopping basket and so forth.

When you visit a page in your browser the cookies from that site are sent back to the server to allow it to change its response accordingly. The information held in a cookie cannot be sent to any site other than its original source.

### How does itison use cookies?

As an online shopping site, we require cookies to be enabled on your browser in order to securely conduct your purchase and show you details of past purchases. These essential cookies are also used to record that you are signed in and details of any recent error messages that you may need to be shown.

If these cookies are not enabled by your browser you won't be able to sign in or purchase items from itison.

### Anonymous analytic cookies

In order to improve our services and monitor for problems, we use anonymous analytic cookies to follow visitors on our site.

These cookies tell us if you've visited our site before, what pages on our site you've seen and if you have taken certain actions (signing in, purchasing an item, etc). The information held by this system is anonymous and cannot identify an individual user.

### Third party social network cookies

To allow you to share pages with your social networks more easily some pages of our site include content from sites such as Facebook and Twitter. These social "buttons" may use cookies to facilitate your interaction with their sites and to track the performance of the buttons. The data held by these cookies is entirely invisible to itison and are never shared with our site.

### How can I turn cookies on or off?

Most modern browsers will allow you to control which cookies you want to accept for any particular website. Although the exact mechanism will vary between browsers you will usually find a "cookies" or "privacy" section under the "Help" menu of your browser's toolbar.

For more information on how your browser can help you filter cookies, please refer to the user guide.
