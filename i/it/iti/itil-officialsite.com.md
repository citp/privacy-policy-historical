## Cookies

Cookies are small files that are often created when you visit a website, and which are stored in the cookie directory of your computer. A cookie often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies do not damage your computer. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You do not have to accept cookies. You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

If you would rather not allow our storage or access to cookies that may contain your aggregate information then you should make appropriate arrangements to deactivate the cookie function on your web browser.

We may collect the domain name and email address of visitors to this website and those that communicate with us via email. We may also collect other aggregate information, e.g. information about the pages users access or visit and the transactions they perform there and any other information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We can also identify the web browser that the user is using and the way in which the user has accessed our website, e.g. via a particular hyperlink or link contained within a marketing email. The information we collect in this way is used for internal review and improvement purposes, e.g. to improve and/or customise the content, and/or layout of our websites for our users or each individual user. This information is not shared with other organisations for commercial purposes.
