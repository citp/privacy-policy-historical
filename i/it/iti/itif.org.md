# Privacy Policy | The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. ITIF will never disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party unless required to do so by court order, law or governmental agency.

  * **Email addresses:** Our newsletter subscribers’ email addresses are stored in an online database. We use these addresses to send ITIF announcements, which subscribers can opt out of. We also reserve the right to use these addresses to contact our subscribers at other times. 


  * **Website transactions:** When a visitor requests pages at our site, the server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name and public IP address. The server may collect this and other basic internet capability information in order to send you the appropriate web content and aggregate information on what pages users access or visit. This information may be used for statistical and operational purposes. Visitors should be advised that ITIF’s website links to other sites, each of which is beyond ITIF’s control. Because of the nature of the Internet, ITIF cannot be responsible for the content or privacy policies of the websites to which it links.


  * **Financial transactions:** ITIF accepts financial support online. Those transactions are processed by a third party, which safeguards our supporters’ personal and financial information according to strict standards of security and confidentiality. 


  * **Other information:** ITIF maintains an offline database of members, supporters, media, subscribers to printed products and publications, and others. Examples of information recorded in the database include names, telephone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses. That information is gathered through personal relationships and forms on this website. From time to time, we notify people in the ITIF database if we think they may be interested in new events, publications or other offerings. 



The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation reserves the right to change the policy on use of information collected. Any changes in policy will be noted in a revised privacy policy statement and will be posted at least 30 days prior to implementation.

If you have a question or comment about ITIF’s information practices, please email us at [mail@itif.org](mailto:mail@itif.org).
