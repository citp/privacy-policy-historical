                    iYogi reserves the right to monitor on-line and   off-line sessions between user and a Technical Support Executive for quality   control of the Service provided to the Customer by Technical Support Executive.   In addition, we may record on-line and off-line sessions conducted on the Web   site for user reference and to assist in resolution of disputes and/or potential   complaints. The session records will also be used to improve the Service, build   a support knowledge base, and/or conduct internal market research. Session   record data will not be correlated with personally identifiable data about   individual customers.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="headingblue">e) Cookies</span><br>
                    A cookie is a   message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message   in a text file. The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly   prepare customized Web pages for them. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to   any personally identifiable information while on our site and cannot infringe   the privacy of our customers.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="headingblue">f) Log Files</span><br>
                    We use IP   addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and   gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not   linked to personally identifiable information.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="headingblue">g)   Sharing</span><br>
                    We will share aggregated demographic information with our   partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that   can identify any individual person.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="headingblue">h) Surveys &amp;   Contests</span><br>
                    From time-to-time our site requests information from user   via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is   completely voluntary and user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose   this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as   name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).   Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey   information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and   satisfaction of this site.<p></p>
                  <p><span class="headingblue">2) SECURITY</span><br>
                    This Web site takes every   precaution to protect information of users. When user submits sensitive   information via the Web site, user information is protected both on-line and   off-line.<br>
                    When our registration form asks User to enter sensitive information   (such as credit card number), the information is encrypted and is protected with   the best of the encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our   registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft   Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when User is   just 'surfing'.<br>
                    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information   online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.   All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned   above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to   perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service   representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our   employees use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When   they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user   information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and   privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added,   our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on   privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.   Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are   kept in a secure environment.<br>
                    <br>
                    In situations that are required by law, we   may disclose some information about our users to law-enforcing officers.</p>
                  <p><span class="headingblue">3) SUPPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION</span><br>
                    In order for   this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is   necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from   Third party sources.<br>
                    For example, to determine our user's creditworthiness,   we may use their name and other related information to request a credit report.   Once we determine user creditworthiness, this document is destroyed. </p>
