We require certain information and permissions from you to provide the Services. 

Some information we collect may be provided by the user directly such as when requested by a form or on the phone by a technician. Other technical information might be collected or accessed by or through our diagnostic and related tools as our computers work with yours to provide the Services.

iYogi technicians are trained in the use of this software and we take steps to limit access to confidential or sensitive information stored on user computer or network, avoid deliberate destruction of information on user computers or networks, and help avoid system problems. iYogi maintains specific internal policy and technical controls to limit how and whether our remote access tools may be used to assist you.
