	<h3>EARTHQUAKE, TSUNAMI & NUCLEAR UPDATE:</h3>
	<p>The number of customers whom have expressed concern as well as asking IBC Japan to make donations on their behalf to the Japan Red Cross to assist in the relief effort has been overwhelming and greatly appreciated. The death toll from the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that triggered a massive tsunami to hit 500 kilometers of Japans Tohoku northeastern coastline on March 11, 2011 as of 9 p.m (noon GMT) March 29 2011 topped a total of 11,004 people. There are still 17,399 people unaccounted for in six prefectures.</p>
	<p>Electricity has now been restored at the Fukushima Nuclear power facility and radiation levels within 30 kilometers of the plant are reported as being "low and under control". Along with Nissan and other automobile manufacturers IBC Japan will be testing its vehicles for radiation prior to shipping however it should be noted that the risk of finding any sort of radiation contamination to our vehicles is highly unlikely.</p>
	<p>IBC Japans policy has always been to not purchase flood damaged vehicles for any reason whatsoever. It is IBC Japans sincere desire to service you our valued customers for all of your immediate and future vehicle needs. Our strict Quality Control inspections continue to lead the industry and will continue to do so for years to come.</p>
	<p>Although the loss of life and property has been of a magnitude never seen since WWII, the relief efforts where swift - water, food, electricity and fuel is gradually being restored to normality and in time we believe that Japan, its industries and its people will fully recover.</p>
	<p>IBC Japans operations are now fully operational and happy to report that none of our staff or their families and friends reported any loss of life or was there any damage to any of our inspection facilities or vehicles. Once again thanking you all for your kind words of encouragement, prayers, donations and thoughts during this difficult time.</p>
