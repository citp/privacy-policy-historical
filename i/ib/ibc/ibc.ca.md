# Privacy Statement

Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) is the national trade association for non-government property and casualty insurers in Canada. The protection of individual privacy is an IBC priority and applies to both:

  1. Information that IBC collects directly from individuals; and
  2. Information under IBC's custody that is reported to IBC by various insurance entities – insurers, brokers and others.



Therefore, IBC has adopted a comprehensive management plan that addresses all aspects of information privacy and security, including accountability, authorization, data collection, usage and disclosure. For more information about IBC's privacy practices, please [click here](http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/PrivacyPolicy/Privacy_brchr_FA_Apr2010.pdf).
