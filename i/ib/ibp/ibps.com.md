At Kalahare your privacy is of the utmost concern to us. That is why we are dedicated to caring for your personal information and are firmly committed to assigning it the highest level of security and confidentiality. The following describes details on information gathering on this site and our use of your information.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

Kalahare collects shopping specific customer information in an attempt to provide the best on-line shopping experience. The company collects information such as the name, address and phone number of the customer. Also included are information used for billing and shipping of customer purchases. These and other necessary personal information are collected on forms when voluntarily submitted to us on the site and are used for customer processing. While some of the information collected is necessary, others are left to the customer’s discretion. However, failure to provide required information may lead to an inability to process orders or use particular site features. We do not share your customer contact information with third parties for promotional purposes. 

#### Processing

In order to efficiently process and ship customer orders, it may be necessary to share client information with intermediaries such as product manufacturers and shipping/postal services. The information is used strictly for these purposes. E-mails are also used to send information about the ability or inability to process orders, shipping details and general correspondence to the customer.

#### Security

Security measures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. User information collected while registering is collected on secure servers. When purchases are made on our website, shoppers are transferred to a secure server using SSL technology (“Secure Sockets Layer”) supported by most major browsers during which their information is encrypted to complete the transaction with their credit card. We do not have access to your credit card information, nor do we store it on our computers.  


#### Purposes of law

####  Accessing and Updating Your Information

Kalahare customers have the right to personally edit and update their on-site information. Simply by logging on to their account profile a customer can edit name, contact or other information. Information dealing with past purchases cannot be deleted but will be deactivated by the company depending on specific client account activity.
