# IBM Privacy

IBM is a member of the TRUSTe program. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the IBM Web site. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe mark, you can expect to be notified of:

  * What information is gathered/tracked
  * How the information is used
  * Who information is shared with

   
**Personal information** |   | 

Personal information At IBM, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit IBM on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.

If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.

We have implemented these practices for the IBM Home Page (www.ibm.com). We are also instructing our employees around the world to include information on privacy practices everywhere information is collected on the IBM Web, tailored to what that portion of the site does and reflecting the practices outlined here.  
   
  
**Information security and quality** |   | 

We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner.

The IBM site contains links to other Web sites. IBM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.  
   
  
**Cookies** |   | 

There are various technologies, including one called "cookies", which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some IBM pages use cookies or other technologies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. For more information, please see "[How to work with Cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/cookies.phtml)".

IBM is also supporting the development of some technologies that will let you manage and control the release of your personal information wherever you go on the Internet.
