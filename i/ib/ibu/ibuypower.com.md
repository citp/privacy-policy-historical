# iBUYPOWER Computer - Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 18, 2011

iBUYPOWER.com (“iBUYPOWER” or “We” or “Us”) respects your privacy. We know that you care how your information is used and distributed, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our Privacy Policy. **By visiting iBUYPOWER.com and/or Dr. I Forum, you are accepting the privacy guidelines as described below.**

**What Personal Information Is Gathered?**  
The information gathered from customers is used to provide services to you, communicate with you about information you request, help us target specific offers to you, and/or help us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at iBUYPOWER. The types of information we gather are:

  * **Information You Give Us** : We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way (e.g. name, telephone numbers, shipping and billing addresses). The information you provide is mainly used for purposes such as responding to your requests, processing your order, customizing future shopping for you, and communicating with you. NOTE: We store credit card information in a separate, secure, and controlled accounting database to facilitate orders only. This database is NOT accessible through the Internet or from outside sources. However, upon request, we will gladly remove your credit card details from our database.
  * **Automatic Information (Cookies):** Like many websites, we use “cookies” to receive and store certain types of information whenever your Web browser accesses iBUYPOWER or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of iBUYPOWER on other websites. Examples of what type of information are automatically collected include what pages you view, the links you click, the materials you access, and other actions taken within our website. ****
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information (e.g. updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, credit history information from credit bureaus, etc). ****



**What About Cookies?**  
These cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you. If you wish to disable the usage of cookies, you can easily do so by clicking the “help” button on the toolbar of your web browser and following the provided instructions. However, because these cookies enable you to successfully sign in, add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, and other essential website features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If left disabled, iBUYPOWER will be unable to accept your online order.

**Do We Share the Information Collected?**  
Our customers’ information is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We only share customer information with: 

  * Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf (e.g. fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service). They have access to personal information, but they may not use it for other purposes.
  * Business Transfers: As we continue to grow and develop our business, we might sell or buy business units, or engage in transfers, acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control or similar transactions. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice.
  * Protection of iBUYPOWER & Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20130415015323id_/http%3A//www.ibuypower.com/Others/Terms.aspx) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, safety of our Site, our users, or others. This includes: exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * With Your Consent: You will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
