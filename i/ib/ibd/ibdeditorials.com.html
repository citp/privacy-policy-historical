<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
  This Web site takes every precaution to protect our
  users' information both online and offline. Any sensitive
  information submitted via the Web site is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
</p>
<p>
  
While we use SSL encryption to protect
  sensitive information online, we also do everything in
  our power to protect user-information off-line. All of
  our users' information is restricted in our
  offices. Only employees who need the information to
  perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access
  to personally identifiable information. 

Our employees
  must use passwords to access this information.
  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our
  security and privacy practices. 

Every quarter, as well
  as any time new policies are added, our employees are
  notified and/or reminded about the importance we place
  on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our
  customers' information is protected. 

Finally, the
  servers that we store personally identifiable
  information on are kept in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions about the security at our
  Web site, you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:help@IBDeditorials.com">help@IBDeditorials.com</a>.
</p>
<h4>Phishing</h4>
<p>
  Phishing is a term used to describe a type of Internet
  scam in which inauthentic e-mails that appear to be
  coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt
  to trick you into providing confidential information.
  These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often
  imply that your account is about to be closed unless
  immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to
  click on a link that leads you to a webpage that
  simulates that of the legitimate source, but is really a
  page specially designed to get you to input your
  confidential information such as account number,
  password, social security number or credit card number.
  The thieves then use that information to commit fraud
  and identity theft against you.
</p>
<p>
  The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up
  a website providing information warning consumers about
  the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself.
  To learn more about phishing, please click on the
  following link: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm');">www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
  Please know that IBDeditorials.com takes
  the privacy of our users and members very seriously. If you
  are ever in question about the legitimacy of an e-mail
  from IBDeditorials.com, please contact customer service at: (800)
  831-2525. If you believe you have been the victim of a
  scam, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade
  Commission at: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/');">www.consumer.gov/idtheft/</a>.
  If you have any additional questions about the security
  at our Web site, you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:help@IBDeditorials.com">help@IBDeditorials.com</a>.
</p>

  information board.
