##  3.1 Ways we collect data

We collect information in the following ways:

  1. **Information you give us**. For example, when you engage with us by registering for an event, becoming a member or otherwise provide us with personal information. When you register, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address and telephone number to store with your account.
  2. **Information we get from your use of our website and services**. We collect information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you visit our websites or view and interact with our content.
  3. **Information from third parties**. We may also receive information about you from third parties. This can include information such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, your geographic location (for mobile devices), credit/debit card details.

  4. **Information from Research**. We may also obtain information about you from your company website and other public sources such as LinkedIn. We will notify you when we receive your data and you will be given the opportunity to opt out of all communication and to remove your data immediately.



##  3.2 Sensitive Personal Data

Data Protection law recognises that certain categories of personal information are more sensitive. This is known as sensitive personal data and covers health information, race, religious beliefs and political opinions. We do not usually collect sensitive personal data about you unless there is a clear reason for doing so, such as any dietary requirements when attending a conference (which may infer religious beliefs) or where we need this information to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support to enable you to participate in an event.

##  7. Legal basis for processing personal data

In most instances, we collect and use your personal information by relying on the legitimate interest legal basis. This is because when you, for example, request to receive services or products from the IBA, we have a legitimate organisational interest to use your personal information to respond to you and there is no overriding prejudice to you by using your personal information for this purpose. This is also the case where we process your donations in support of IBAHRI and the IBA Foundation's objectives, for our internal administrative purposes, and where we need to take steps to protect our network security or risk of fraud.

In some instances, we will rely on obtaining your consent to our use of your personal information. This is the case, for example, where we seek to obtain your consent to receive email marketing about the IBA.

##  8. Marketing – It’s your choice

We want to ensure you receive the level of information about the IBA that is right for you. It is always your choice as to whether you want to receive information about our work and the ways you can get involved. If you do not want us to use your personal information in these ways please indicate your preferences on the form on which we collect your data, in the MyIBA Manage Preferences option or contact us at [member@int-bar.org](mailto:member@int-bar.org). You will always receive communication about your account and membership renewal.

You may opt-out of our marketing communications at any time by clicking the ‘Opt-out/unsubscribe’ link in at the end of our marketing emails. You can also change any of your contact preferences at any time (including telling us that you don’t want us to contact you for marketing purposes by telephone, or by post) by contacting our Membership Services Team on +44 (0) 20 7842 0090 or [member@int-bar.org](mailto:member@int-bar.org). If you do opt out, we will retain your details on a suppression list to help ensure that we do not continue to contact you.

##  8.1 Email Marketing

If you actively provide your consent to us along with your email address, we will contact you for marketing purposes by email. By subscribing to IBA emails or opting in to email communication from IBA, you grant us the right to use the email for both email marketing purposes and advertisement targeting.

##  8.2 Post/telephone marketing

If you have provided us with your postal address or telephone number we may send you direct mail or telephone you about our work unless you have told us that you would prefer not to receive such information.

##  8.3 IBA Members’ Directory

One of the benefits of membership is that you can be listed in the IBA Members’ Directory. If you would like to opt out of appearing, choose ‘Manage Profile’ from the My IBA Home menu, and select ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ under ‘Make your Profile Public’ to make your profile accessible or inaccessible through ‘Members Directory’. Note that only current Members, Group Members, and Corporate Members have access to the Members’ Directory.

##  8.4 Photography and Filming

Certain sessions and/or social functions may be photographed and/or filmed and some of this content may be used for future IBA marketing materials, member communications, products or services. Should you have any concerns with regard to this, or do not wish to be featured in any of these materials please contact the IBA Marketing Department at [ibamarketing@int-bar.org](mailto:ibamarketing@int-bar.org).

##  9. Data Retention

In order to comply with accounting regulations, we keep records for all individuals who have purchased goods or services from the IBA (e.g. conference registration, IBA membership) for 7 years, and will continue to send you marketing information about related conferences or about IBA membership during that period.

If you register your interest for a conference, but have not yet attended one, we retain your contact details for up to 3 years and will send you marketing information about related conferences or about IBA membership.

If you applied for membership but never completed your application, we will leave the invoice available to you until the end of the calendar year. We would then suspend your membership and keep your record for up to 3 years after that; we will continue to send you marketing information about related conferences or about IBA membership.

You can opt out at any time by emailing [member@int-bar.org](mailto:member@int-bar.org) or logging into your My IBA and going to Manage Preferences.

##  10\.  Your rights to your personal information

Under the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the following rights:

**1\. The right to be informed** \- this is fulfilled through this notice.

**2\. The right of access -** you have the right to obtain confirmation that your data is being processed and access to your personal data. This is so that you are aware of and can verify the lawfulness of the processing. If you request the information, we will provide a copy of the information free of charge. However, we will charge a ‘reasonable fee’ when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive. This also applies to additional copies of the same information. The information will be provided without excessive delay, and at the latest within one month of receipt. This period can be extended by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous. If this is the case, we will inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary. The information will be sent as a password-protected PDF. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because they are repetitive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information; or refuse to respond. Where we refuse to respond to a request, we will explain why to you, informing you of your right to complain to the supervisory authority and to a judicial remedy without undue delay and at the latest within one month.

Should you wish to exercise these rights, we require you to prove your identity with two pieces of approved identification. Please address requests to the Operations Director, International Bar Association, 10 St Bride St, London, EC4A 4AD and we will respond within 30 days, of receipt of your written request and confirmed ID. Please provide as much information as possible about the nature of your contact with us to help us locate your records.

Further information can be found in our Data Subject Access Request [policy](https://web.archive.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=DFC70E36-59B8-46E5-BBC6-EE1743564503) and [form.](https://web.archive.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=E5DE7FC1-91BB-4A6F-8B3E-4A29FF7C9FD5)

**3\. The right to rectification** \- to amend your personal information log in to MyIBA, choose ‘Manage Personal Details’, where you can amend all your personal data. If you are unable to log in to MyIBA, it may mean that your membership status does not grant you access to members’ area of the website. If you need to inquire about your level of access or if you wish to remove your data, please contact the Membership Services Team, [member@int-bar.org](mailto:member@int-bar.org), and they will assist you.

If we have disclosed the personal data in question to third parties, we will inform them of the rectification where possible. We can also inform you about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where appropriate.

**4\. The right to erase** \- this is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. The broad principle underpinning this right is to enable you to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. If you would like us to erase you from our database, please email [member@int-bar.org](mailto:member@int-bar.org). If we have disclosed the personal data in question to third parties, we will inform them about the erasure of the personal data, unless it is impossible or involves disproportionate effort to do so.

**5\. The right to restrict processing** \- individuals have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data. When processing is restricted, we are permitted to store the personal data, but not further process it. We are able to retain just enough information about the individual to ensure that the restriction is respected in future e.g. your name and email address on an email marketing suppression list. 

The right to restrict processing applies in the following circumstances:

  * Where you contest the accuracy of the personal data, we will restrict the processing until we have verified the accuracy of the personal data.
  * Where you have objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests), and we are considering whether our legitimate grounds override yours.
  * When processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead.
  * If we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.



If we have disclosed the personal data in question to third parties, we will inform them about the restriction on the processing of the personal data, unless it is impossible or involves disproportionate effort to do so. We will inform you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing.

**6\. The right to object - y** ou have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests (including profiling) and direct marketing (including profiling). The objection must be on “grounds relating to his or her particular situation”. We will inform you of your right to object in the first communication you receive from us. We will stop processing personal data for direct marketing purposes as soon as we receive an objection.

**7.** **The right to data portability** \- you have the right to obtain the data that the IBA processes on you and use it for your own purposes. This means you have the right to receive the personal data that you have provided to the IBA in a structured machine readable format and to transmit the data to a different data controller. 

This right applies in the following circumstances:

  * where you have provided the data to the IBA
  * where the processing is carried out because you have given the IBA your consent to do so
  * where the processing is carried out in order to perform the employment contract between you and the IBA
  * where processing is carried out by automated means. No membership data is processed using automated means so this right does not apply.

##  11. Rights in relation to profiling and remarketing

##  11.1 Profiling

We may collect, and our third party providers of advertisements and content may collect, information about where you are on the internet (e.g. the URL you came from, IP address, domain types like .co.uk and .com), your browser type, the country and telephone area code where your computer is located, purchase history, the pages of our website that were viewed during your visit, the advertisements you clicked on, and any search terms that you entered on our website ("User Information"). We may collect this information even if you do not register with us.

The IBA uses remarketing on other websites to present you with products and services we think may be of interest to you, based on your browsing history. Third-party vendors, including Google, Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter, may show IBA adverts on sites across the Internet.

We do have relationships with carefully-selected and monitored suppliers who may also set cookies during your visit to be used for remarketing purposes, to show you different products and services based on what you appear to be interested in. These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

##  12. Recipients – Information and Disclosure

The IBA may disclose your personal information in the following circumstances:

  1. To suppliers or service providers only to provide the products or services you've requested from us where, for example, we use a separate company to deliver goods to you.
  2. To third parties who provide a service to us and are data processors. This would include our trusted partners that work with us, and other entities that act as fundraisers for IBA, sell IBA products or provide IBA information and marketing (subject to your communication preferences and our internal policies and procedures). We require these third parties to comply strictly with our instructions and data protection laws and we will make sure that appropriate controls are in place. We enter into contracts with all of our data processors and regularly monitor their activities to ensure they are complying with IBA policies and procedures.
  3. Where we are under a duty to disclose your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation (for example, to government bodies and law enforcement agencies), or in order to enforce or apply our rights (including in relation to our website or other applicable terms and conditions) or to protect the IBA, for example in cases of suspected fraud or defamation.
  4. To IBA Officers, to assist with the running of the IBA.

##  13. International transfers of personal information

As the IBA is a global association, we have regional offices in Sao Paulo, Seoul and Washington, They transfer, process and store the data hosted in the EU in order to provide IBA services at a more local level. If they use any data regarding European Economic Area (EEA) citizens, they sign a data sharing agreement.

We also use suppliers (such as conference venues) outside the EEA. This means that your personal information is transferred, processed and stored outside the EEA. This includes countries that the European Union authorities do not consider provides and adequate level of protection for personal data. However, we take steps to put in place suitable safeguards to protect your personal information when processed by the supplier such as entering into the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses. If you would like to receive further information about our safeguards, please contact [dataprotection@int-bar.org](mailto:dataprotection@int-bar.org)
