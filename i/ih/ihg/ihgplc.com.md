# Privacy Statement - Services - InterContinental Hotels Group PLC

The privacy and security of your information is very important to us. Whether you are booking a room or are a member of one of our loyalty programmes, we want you to trust that the information that you have provided to us is being properly managed and protected.

We have prepared this Privacy Statement to explain more about who we are and how we collect and manage your information.

##  Who we are 

This Privacy Statement is issued by the InterContinental Hotels Group of Companies (collectively referred to as “IHG”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy Statement), which includes the direct and indirect subsidiaries of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and covers information collected and used by us in the course of our business. When we mention "IHG", "we", "us", or "our" we are referring to the relevant company in the InterContinental Hotels Group that processes your personal information.

Your information may also be collected and used by IHG-branded hotels. In most cases these hotels are independently owned and their use of your information is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.

If you would like to learn more about IHG and our relationship with our IHG-branded hotels, click below.

We are a global hospitality company with IHG-branded hotels in nearly 100 countries. We predominantly franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent third-party owners. We also operate a number of programmes that are related to our hotel business such as IHG Rewards Club, which is our core loyalty programme.

We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, third-party owners. Most hotels operating under IHG’s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel (referred to as “Franchisees” or “Franchised Hotels”). If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will share your information with that hotel. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will be governed by their own privacy practices and is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.

### Information we collect and how we use and share it

We collect and use personal information if you make a booking through our reservation system, stay at an IHG-branded hotel, participate in one of our loyalty programmes such as IHG® Rewards Club or interact with us through our corporate site. We generally collect this information directly from you, but in some cases we may collect your information from other sources. For example, we occasionally run promotions where we ask IHG Rewards Club Members to refer a friend to the IHG Rewards Club. In these cases we always ask members to make sure anyone they refer is happy for their personal information to be passed to us, and to direct friends to read this privacy policy if they want to find out more about how we use their information. We also collect information through our third party service providers' use of technologies such as pixels, web beacons, tracking tools and similar technologies. For more information please click here.

You do not have to provide us with your information although in some cases, if you do not, it may mean that you are unable to use our services. For example, we may be unable to complete any booking you may wish to make, or you may be unable to participate in our loyalty programmes.

To learn more about how we collect, use and share your information, please click the relevant section below.

**Information we collect:** We collect information from you when you make a booking through our reservation system or stay at an IHG-branded hotel. Information collected during the course of the reservation and during your stay may include: 

  * Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality and payment card information; 
  * Information relating to your membership in one of our services or programmes or those of our programme partners such as your IHG® Rewards Club number or frequent flier number; and 
  * Information such as stay and room preferences made during the course of your reservation such as your preferred room type and specific requests to the hotel. 



This information may be provided to us directly when you make a reservation through one of our global reservation offices, through our websites, directly at the hotel or through our mobile applications. In some cases we will receive this information from a third-party, such as when you book through an online travel agency or if information is provided directly to one of our Franchisees. 

**How we use this information:** We use the information collected from you primarily to fulfil your hotel reservation. Prior to your stay this may include sending your information to the hotel or sending you pre-stay communications. Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your experience. 

In some instances where we have your consent or where permitted under applicable law, we may send you marketing communications (which may include text messages or calls placed using autodialer technology) for products and services that we believe would be relevant for you. We also may use information related to your stay to display targeted advertisements on our websites or on third-party websites or to send you more relevant messaging. Additionally, we use this information for purposes of aggregated trend and statistical analysis to evaluate and improve our products and services, plan new hotel locations and services and other market research. 

**Who we share your information with:** We will share your information with the hotel you are staying at to fulfil your reservation. We may also share your information with third-party service providers to provide services in relation to our business as well as to help us improve our products and services. For example, we might use a third party or a third-party product for the purposes of market research and data analytics, or share data with online partners we work with, so we, or our online partners on our behalf, can communicate with you and serve advertisements through their platforms or on other websites or platforms. In certain instances, subject to local consent requirements, third-party service providers may also assist us with various marketing campaigns. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also share your information with third parties, including our IHG® Rewards Club partners and other third parties, to extend special offers about their own products and services to you. These parties have agreed to comply with our privacy requirements. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our global customer care offices or the [IHG Privacy Office](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/privacy-office). 

We also share your stay information with other third parties in circumstances such as: 

  * when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees, the public or IHG property; 
  * when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process; or 
  * in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction. 



**Information we collect:** We collect information from you during the course of your membership in any of our loyalty programmes and services, including our core loyalty programme, IHG® Rewards Club. Information collected during the course of your enrolment and participation in these programmes may include: 

  * Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality, birthday and payment card information; 
  * Your membership number and pin as well as details of your memberships with any of our programme partners such as our airline or car rental partners; 
  * Information that you choose to provide in your loyalty profile, such as your personal stay and destination preferences; and 
  * Marketing preferences, including how you prefer to be contacted by IHG as well as what types of information you are interested in hearing about. 



This information may be provided to us directly through our global reservation and customer care offices, through our websites, via social media, directly at the hotel or through our mobile applications. In some cases we may receive this information from a third party, such as one of our Franchisees. We may also collect information from other sources, such as publicly available information, to help identify what types of marketing information you may be interested in hearing about. 

**How we use this information:** We use your information to operate and provide services in connection with our loyalty programmes. We also use your information to improve our products and services. 

This may include: 

  * Enrolment in the loyalty programme; 
  * The order and delivery of merchandise that you have redeemed online; 
  * Sending you updates, account statements and other information relating to your participation in one of our programmes or services; 
  * Sending you marketing communications (which may include text messages or calls placed using autodialler technology) in relation to the products and services offered by IHG or its third-party partners or affiliates; 
  * Providing you with personalised advertisements or communications for IHG products or services that we believe may be relevant for you; and 
  * Analytics, statistical analysis and other research. 



Although provision of much of the information requested is voluntary, the failure to provide certain information may impact and/or prevent our ability to offer you certain services.  

We occasionally run promotions where we ask IHG Rewards Club Members to refer a friend to the IHG Rewards Club.  In these cases, we always ask members to make sure anyone they refer is happy for their personal information to be passed to us, and to direct friends to read this privacy policy if they want to find out more about how we use their information.

**How you can manage your marketing preferences** **:**  You can manage your preferences and decide what marketing communications you would like to receive from us in our online preference centre. You can find out more [information here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190522093643id_/https%3A//www.ihgplc.com/en/services/privacy-statement?accordion=accordion4_tab1).

In addition you can opt out of collection of your personal information for use in targeted advertising.  Please click here for more information on how to do this.

We also recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms as well as your preferences within your Rewards Club account.

**Who we share your information with:** During the course of your participation in our loyalty programmes, it may be necessary to share your information with third parties such as our third-party partners and service providers for the purposes of operating the programme and to provide you with the products and services that you have requested. We also use third-party service providers to assist us with managing, carrying out and improving our advertising. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also share your information with third parties, including our IHG® Rewards Club partners and other third parties, to extend special offers about their own products and services to you. These parties have agreed to comply with our privacy requirements. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our [global customer care offices](https://www.ihg.com/hotels/gb/en/customer-care/) or the [IHG Privacy Office](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/privacy-office).

  * Information relating to your registration for corporate news such as your name, email address, profession, country/region and email service preferences for news; and 
  * Information relating to the receipt of shareholder documents such as your initials, surname, postcode, shareholder account number, email address and password for shareholder communications. 



This information may be provided to us directly when you sign up for corporate news or shareholder documents on our corporate site. 

**How we use this information:** We use the information collected from you to provide you with corporate news and shareholder documents for which you have signed up. For corporate news, you may change your communication preferences in accordance with the “Managing your communication preferences” section below 

**Who we share your information with:** We may share your information with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our corporate site and our shareholder functions. These services may include the provision of shareholder documents. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our [global customer care offices](https://www.ihg.com/hotels/us/en/customer-care/contact-us) or the [IHG Privacy Office](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/privacy-office).




We will also share your information with other third parties in circumstances, such as:

  * when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees, the public or IHG property;
  * when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process; or
  * in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction.



There are other times when we collect and use personal information, for example if you choose to participate in one of our competitions or sweepstakes, sign up to receive our newsletters or other special offers and promotions, download one of our mobile applications or participate in one of our other services. In these instances, we will collect information from you for running and administering the respective competition, sweepstakes or service that you have elected to participate in. The information collected may include personal details such as your name and address as well as certain demographic information. In each case, we will collect, use and secure your information in a manner consistent with the general principles set out in this Privacy Statement unless we tell you otherwise. 

We also collect information from you when you browse our website, use our mobile applications or participate in certain services at an IHG-branded hotel. In these instances, information such as your country information, internet protocol (“IP”) address, media access control address and other characteristics about your system or device may be automatically collected.

**The legal basis for processing your personal data:** We are committed to collecting and using your information in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

We will only collect, use and share your information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this. This may be because:

  * you have provided your consent to us using the personal information; 
  * our use of your information is necessary to perform our contract with you, for example, making and managing your booking and operating and providing services in connection with our Loyalty Programme in accordance with the terms of our agreement with you;
  * our use of your information is necessary to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or otherwise meet our legal responsibilities;

If you would like to find out more about the legal basis for which we process personal information, please contact [our offices](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/privacy-office). If you have provided your consent to our processing of your information you can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting the [IHG Privacy Office](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/privacy-office). 

###  Data transfer 

As we operate via a global network of corporate offices, reservation and service centres, data centres and hotels, it may be necessary to transfer your information to a country outside of the country where it was originally collected or outside of your country of residence or nationality. The information that you provide us during the course of a reservation or through the provision of any other services may be transferred to any of our IHG-owned or affiliated entities and hotels around the world for the purposes of carrying out or facilitating these services. It will also be necessary to transfer this information to third parties, including, without limitation, our Franchisees, partners and third-party service providers.

Where we transfer information which originates in the European Union ( **"EU"** ) to a country outside of the EU, we will take steps to make sure such transfer is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights:

  * transfers within the IHG Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the IHG Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the IHG Group;
  * where we transfer your data outside of the IHG Group including to other companies providing us with a service, we will obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your information. Some of these assurances are well recognised certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States of America;
  * we will only transfer personal information to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights; and
  * any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully validated before personal information is disclosed.



###  Using our websites, mobile applications and other technology 

We and our third-party service providers use cookies, pixels, web beacons, tracking tools and other similar technologies on our websites, mobile applications and in other areas of our business to collect information and provide you with the services that you have requested or participate in and to provide targeted advertising. Subject to local consent requirements, we may use this and other information we collect, such as a hashed email address, to help us and our third-party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.). We, and our third party service providers, also may use the cross-device tracking and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices. We also use the information that we collect to improve our products and services as well as your experience when visiting our websites and using our mobile applications. For more information on these subjects, please click the relevant section below.

We may receive information about your location during the course of and for the purpose of providing you the services described above through your use of our websites and mobile applications. For example, if you are using our mobile applications and have consented to sharing your location information with us, this information might be collected through GPS or Bluetooth technologies to enable us to provide certain services to you such as customised offers and promotions. In addition to your use of our websites and mobile applications, we may also receive location information from wireless networks or cellular towers in proximity to your mobile device, through your Internet protocol (“IP”) address or through your use of other services we provide at our hotels. We may also have access to location information that you provide to us through your use of social media, such as when you “tweet” your location. Your location preferences can be set or modified at the device level or through modifying your settings with the relevant social media platform.

We receive information about you when you use our mobile applications. Some information such as your device manufacturer, type and operating system version are collected automatically, while other information is only collected if you choose to provide it, such as your location information. Where we process and use your personal information in connection with any mobile applications, we will do this in line with the general principles outlined in this Statement unless we tell you otherwise. 

If you use our mobile app, we also send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information. 

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile applications on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application. 

We may use information from online sources, such as websites, social media and information sharing platforms. This information may be used to help tailor and improve our services and communicate with you effectively, as we know many of our customers use a range of media channels to communicate and share information. 

We may use various social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button on our websites and mobile applications. Certain information may be shared or otherwise provided to us through your use of these features in conjunction with our services and programmes. Subject to your account and privacy settings, we may also be able to see information that you post when using these social media platforms whether or not you are using one of our services. In some instances, depending on the circumstances, we may contact you on these social media platforms. The information you post on social media sites as well as the controls surrounding these disclosures are governed by the respective policies of these third parties. 

Where we use information from these sources, we will respect any permissions you have set about how you would like your information to be used for each source. 

We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms To learn more about opting out of certain types of targeted advertising, please see the “Managing cookies and opting out” section below.

**Third-party cookies:** As described above, we use a number of third-party service providers to help us manage, carry out and improve our advertising. These parties set cookies at our direction to help us collect information and provide you with advertisements that we believe would be relevant for you.

**Targeted advertising:** We and our third-party service providers may serve targeted advertisements through the use of first-party or third-party cookies, pixels and web beacons when you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or visit third party websites. In some instances, these cookies may be persistent cookies. As described in the using our websites, mobile applications and other technology section above, we and our third party service providers may also use cookie and other information to try to identify other devices and web browsers that you may use so we and our third-party service providers may serve targeted advertisements to those devices. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you as well as improve our own products and services, including the functionality and performance of our websites and mobile applications. To learn more about opting out of certain types of targeted advertising, please see the “Managing cookies and opting out” section above.

Our websites are not intended for children and we do not intentionally solicit or collect personal information from individuals under the age of 18. If we are notified or otherwise discover that a minor’s personal information has been improperly collected, we will take all commercially reasonable steps to delete that information. In limited instances, we may have a campaign or programme targeted towards children. In these instances details on the information practices will be presented within the terms and conditions of the programme or campaign.

###  Retaining your information in our systems 

We generally only keep your information for as long as is reasonably required for the reasons explained in this privacy policy. In some cases we keep transactional records (which may include your information) for longer periods if necessary to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. We will also retain information if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation.

We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to the records we hold.
