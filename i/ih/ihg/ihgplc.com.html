<p>This privacy policy explains the way in which InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and its subsidiaries may use the information collected from or provided by you via our website at <a href="http://www.ihgplc.com">www.ihgplc.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Use of your personal information</h2>
<p>InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and its subsidiaries are committed to the online privacy of all its users. This policy statement is designed to give a clear explanation of InterContinental Hotels Group's data processing practices. For your protection, we are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and have given all appropriate notifications to the Information Commissioner. </p>
<p>We may use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>to provide information requested by you, or to record or respond to feedback you provide on our website</li>
    <li>to consider your suitability for employment, both for a specific post or role you are applying for or for other positions we think you may be suitable for (this may include sending your personal information to our offices and subsidiaries worldwide)</li>
    <li>to contact you regarding your application, for example to inform you of the progress of your application or request further information</li>
    <li>to administer this website and help us improve our services, including statistical analysis </li>
</ul>
<p>We may share non-personal aggregate statistics (group) data about our site visitors' traffic patterns with partners or other parties. However, we do not sell any information about individual users. </p>

<h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
<p>In order to consider your application or provide you with the information which you have requested, your personal information may be transferred or shared with our Group companies and offices, and other professionals or third parties who act for or with us. Details of our offices can be found on this website.</p>
<p>We may share, transfer or disclose the information in our databases and server logs to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this website, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a joint venture or collaboration, financing, sale, merger, corporate reorganisation, dissolution or similar event.</p>
<p>We may also release personal information to regulatory or law enforcement agencies, if they require us to do so. We may also disclose your information where we are permitted and requested to do so by law.</p>
<p>If we or our business merges with, or is acquired by, another business or company (or is considering either of these possibilities) we may share your personal information with the prospective owners of the business or company and their advisors. If a merger or acquisition actually happens, you should receive notice of this.</p>
<p>It is possible that your personal information may be transferred to recipients outside the European Economic Area to countries which do not have any or equivalent data protection laws to those of the United Kingdom and you consent to us doing so. Where appropriate, before disclosing personal information to a third party, we require the third party contractually to take adequate precautions to protect that personal data and to comply with applicable law.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree (or your browser agrees automatically if you have set it up in that way), your browser adds that text in a small file. </p>
<p>A cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets website operators know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easier to shop, by allowing you to place things into a shopping basket; the basket itself is not a cookie; the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your basket versus others in use at the same time. </p>
<p>We have included a full list of the cookies used on ihgplc.com below, along with a definition of what the cookie is used for. InterContinental Hotels Group PLC will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. </p>
<br>
<h3>How to control and delete cookies</h3>
<p>We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit that you and InterContinental Hotels Group PLC gain from their proper use is worthwhile.</p>
<p>You can delete the files that contain cookies – those files are stored as part of your internet browser. If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by ihgplc.com, or indeed any other website, or if you wish to receive notification of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. Please be aware that declining or denying cookies may prevent you from being able to use the website to its highest capability.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" rel="external" class="external_nofile" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new browser window.">www.aboutcookies.org</a> which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your computer as well as more general information about cookies. For information on how to do this on the browser of your mobile device you will need to refer to your manual.</p>
