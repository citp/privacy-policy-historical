We recognize that our customers' privacy is important and we take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we use identifiable information regarding our customers and members that is acquired through your use of our Web site. It does not apply to any other information you may choose to provide us in any other context (e.g., by mail, in person, over the telephone, etc.). Primarily, we collect such information for the purpose of providing you with an outstanding service experience. We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties. 

By providing us with your personal information and by using this Web site, you accept this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **Information We Collect:** You may visit our site without providing any personal information. However, if you choose to use our services or request that we send information to you, you may be asked to supply personally identifiable information (such as your name, title, company name, industry, address, email address, and telephone numbers). For example, we use forms on this site to allow you to contact us directly via email. We use the information provided in your email to respond to your questions or comments. We may also store your comments for future reference. Similarly, we use the information you choose to provide us to allow you to receive e-mail updates or to receive further information about our company. Providing this information is completely voluntary; we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. In addition to the personally identifying information discussed above, anonymous information is collected for every visitor to this site. This includes pages viewed, date and time, and browser type. We do not make any association between this information and a visitor's identity. Certain personal information is collected for internal marketing strategies and fraud detection. This information will not be sold or shared with any third parties, nor do we keep this information longer than 24 months.

 **Ordering Gift Cards:** In addition to collected opt-in and anonymous information mentioned above, visitors of IHOP.com who purchase IHOP gift cards through our online ordering system will have information collected about them. General shipping and billing information is collected in order to process the transaction. Geophysical data such as IP (Internet Protocol) address information (City, State, Country, Latitude and Longitude) is also collected.

 **Who We May Share Your Information With:** We may share your information with third party intermediaries for the purpose of providing you the services and information you request. For example, we may provide your personal information to vendors processing our outbound email communication or to shipping companies (e.g., FedEx, U.S. Mail, etc.) to deliver you the materials you request. Naturally, if we are required by court order, a lawfully issued subpoena, or are otherwise required by law, we will disclose your information to the extent so required. 

**How We Notify You of Changes to This Policy:** We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time and will notify users of this Website by posting the amended terms on the Website. 

**Security Disclaimer:** It is commonly known that information transferred over the Internet is never 100% secure. For example, such information may be viewed by a third party while in transit or may be unlawfully accessed by a third party who hacks into an otherwise protected computer. Consequently, although we endeavor to protect the privacy of your private information, you acknowledge that there are security and confidentiality risks associated with the Internet which are beyond our control and that the safekeeping of information exchanged between us over the Internet cannot be absolutely guaranteed.
