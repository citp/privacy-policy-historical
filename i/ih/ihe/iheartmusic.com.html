        also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on
        the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security
        purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers

        content from another server.
    </p>

        Except as described here, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share
        non-Personal Information, such as aggregate data and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share your information as disclosed at the time you
        provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Notice and in the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf</strong>
        We may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners) such as service providers
        that host or operate our Platforms, analyze data, process transactions and payments, fulfill orders or provide customer service; advertisers; sponsors or
        other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions, contests, sweepstakes, surveys or provide marketing or promotional assistance and
        "powered by" partners or partners in co-branded sites. Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates,
        sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Agreement To Have Your Personal Information Shared</strong>
        While on our Platforms, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent
        to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. If you agree to have your Personal
        Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy
        policy and business practices of that third party.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Business Transfers</strong>
        We may share your Personal Information with other entities and our affiliates primarily for business and operational purposes. In the event that Clear
        Channel is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that
        transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Legal Disclosure</strong>
        We may transfer and disclose your information to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law or a
        governmental authority requires it; to verify or enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to
        respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect our rights or property or security of third parties, visitors to our Platforms or the public.
    </p>

    <h3>4.	INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES</h3><a name="thirdparties"></a>
    <p>
        We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Clear
        Channel, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to
        participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third
        party website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Usage Information and Personal
        Information such as lists of your friends, "likes", comments you have shared, groups and location. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to
        post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive
        information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about
        you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or
        interactive service. We may supplement the information we collect about you through the Platforms with such information from third parties in order to
        enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and/or to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of
        interest to you.
    </p>

    <h3>5.	YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS, CHOICE AND ACCESS.</h3><a name="access"></a>

    <p>
        You may always direct us not to share your Personal Information with third parties (other than our service providers), not to use your Personal Information
        to provide you with information or offers, or not to send you newsletters, emails or other communications by: (i) modifying your registered user
        information on the Platforms; (ii) sending us an email at privacy@iheartradio.com; (iii) contacting us by mail at Clear Channel Digital Customer Service,
        200 E. Basse Road, San Antonio, TX 78209; or (iv) following the removal instructions in the communication that you receive. Your opt-out request will be
        processed within 30 days of the date on which we receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to modify, verify, correct, or delete any of your Personal Information collected through the Platforms, you may edit your registered user
        information or contact us at the above address or email. In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal
        Information you have submitted through the Platforms. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability
        arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your
        information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will retain your information (including geo-location
        data) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your
        information to provide you services contact us at privacy@iheartradio.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by our social media
        partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the
        appropriate social media site.
    </p>

    <h3>6.	ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT-OUT.</h3><a name="advert"></a>

    <p>
        We may use third party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with
        information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you
        give us permission). Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content
        personalized to your interests which they infer from your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited. In doing so, the provider collects or
        has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information. The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is
        subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by
        visiting the TRUSTe Preference Manager at http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you
        will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
        Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing
        activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The TRUSTe Preference Manager provides a tool
        that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides a mechanism to opt out of receiving cookies from those companies.    <strong><em></em></strong>
    </p>

    <h3>7.	CHILDREN.</h3><a name="children"></a>

    <p>
        The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13
        years of age. If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the
        parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we
        will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
    </p>

    <h3>8.	SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.</h3><a name="security"></a>

    <p>
        We take information security seriously; however, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note
        that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Platforms and provide us with your information at your
        own risk.
    </p>

    <h3>9.	OTHER SITES.</h3><a name="othersites"></a>

    <p>
        The Platforms may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners that may use
        our logo(s) as part of a co-branding or co-marketing agreement. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their
        content, products, services or privacy policies or practices. These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect
        data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of
        any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking page).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Platforms may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Remember that any information that you disclose in these areas
        becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Notice.
    </p>

    <h3>10.	CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.</h3><a name="consent"></a>

    <p>
        The Platforms are governed by and operated in, and in accordance with the laws of, the United States, and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of
        the United States. Clear Channel makes no representation that the Platforms are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of any other nation.
        Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you
        are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and
        processed in the United States. By using the Platforms, or providing us with any information, you (a) acknowledge that the Platforms are subject to the
        laws of the United States, (b) consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other
        applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a
        citizen, and (c) waive any claims that may arise under those laws.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the
