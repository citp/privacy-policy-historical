# Privacy Policy

We value our customers and will make every effort to respect your privacy. 

Effective on 02/18/2004

**TRUSTe Licensee**  
iHerb is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.iherb.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have any questions regarding this privacy statement please do not hesitate in contacting us. Email your questions to [info@iherb.com](mailto:info@iherb.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through the _TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process_ at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve users concerns

**Information Collected and How it is Used**  
If you opted to register with us you are asked for a login id and a password to establish the registration. Once registered you may input Name, and address to facilitate ordering and reordering from iHerb. However, registration is not required to order from us.

  
During the order process you will be asked for shipping information, name, address, telephone number, email, and choice of payment method. This information is collected in order to process your purchase and shipping purposes. Upon completion of the online order, a confirmation of your order will be sent via email to the email address you supplied. If you opted to rate us you will get another email in 2 weeks from Yahoo with a rating form.

  
iHerb is hosted by Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information, but may only use this information in the aggregate. If you accessed this store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Please see the [Yahoo! Privacy Policy](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/) for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information.

Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Disclosure to Third Parties**  
We use third party service providers such as credit card processors and delivery companies to assist us in fulfilling your order. These companies use your information to authorize payment and to deliver your order to you.

  
Otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, or transfer your personal information to third parties. The information you give us is confidential, and will not be sold or given to any individual or company or organization. **This is our simple promise to you.**

**  
Newsletter**  
If you did not opt-out of receiving our newsletter after placing an order with us or if you signed up to receive it while visiting our site, we provide a way for you to unsubscribe from it if you no longer wish to receive it. If you wish to unsubscribe from our newsletter, you may do so by following the unsubscribe instructions within the newsletter or you may email us at [info@iherb.com](mailto:info@iherb.com).

**Cookies**  
Yahoo! Stores will place a cookie whenever you place an item in your shopping cart. The cookie is used to maintain the shopping cart and make ordering products easier. Your browser needs to accept cookies, otherwise the shopping cart will not function properly. See Yahoo's privacy statement for more information on how Yahoo uses cookies [Yahoo! Privacy Policy](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/).

iHerb.com does not set cookies on its Web site.

  
**Security**  
When you submit personal information on our Web site, we will protect your information both online and offline. 

  
When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted on the Yahoo Store platform, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in secured facilities. iherb.com's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [info@iherb.com](mailto:info@iherb.com).

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**  
If you need to correct or update your personal information (such as your email address), or you no longer desire our services, you can let us know by emailing our customer support at [info@iherb.com](mailto:info@iherb.com) or calling **888.792.0028**.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we change our privacy policy, we will post a notice of the change on our homepage, so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, it will be disclosed. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Web site 30 days prior to implementing the change. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner

  
**Legal Disclaimer**  
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process served on our Web site.
