# iHerb.com - Privacy Policy

**In a nutshell:**   Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at iHerb

When you submit personal information on our website, your information is protected both online and offline. We can only access your credit card (but not your actual credit card information) to issue credits, never for actual charges. Only you can produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account. 

While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon of your web browser becomes locked. This indicates that the connection between your web browser and our web server is secured. While on a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https'. 

When you submit sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry —(Secure Socket Layer). 

We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it. 

And as always, iHerb.com will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other parties. And we will never share it unless required by law.

Information Collected and How it is Used

If you opted to register with us you are asked for a login ID and a password to establish the registration. Once registered, you must input your name and address to facilitate ordering and reordering from iHerb. Registration is required to order from us. 

During the order process, you will be asked for shipping information name, address, telephone number, email, and choice of payment method. This information is collected in order to process your purchase and is for shipping purposes only. 

Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Disclosure to Third Parties

We use third party service providers such as credit card processors and delivery companies to assist us in fulfilling your order. These companies use your information to authorize payment and to deliver your order to you. Otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, or transfer your personal information to third parties. The information you give us is confidential, and will not be sold or given to any individual or company or organization. This is our promise to you. 

Newsletter

If you did not opt out of receiving our newsletter after placing an order with us or if you signed up to receive it while visiting our site, there is a way for you to unsubscribe from it if you no longer wish to receive it. To unsubscribe from our newsletter, you may follow the unsubscribe instructions within the newsletter or email us at [info@iHerb.com.](mailto:info@iHerb.com)

Live Chat

iHerb.com uses Live Chat in order to provide an immediate means of asking questions concerning purchase on iHerb.com. Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Sessions and Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use session ID cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. iHerb Store will place a temporary session when you place an item in your shopping cart. The session is used to maintain the shopping cart and make ordering products easier. 

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

Security

When you submit personal information on our website, we will protect your information both online and offline. 

When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it. For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited access, secured facilities. iHerb.com's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@iHerb.com](mailto:security@iHerb.com). 

Correcting/Updating Personal Information

If you need to correct or update your personal information (such as your email address), or if you no longer desire our service, you can let us know by emailing our customer support at [info@iHerb.com](mailto:info@iHerb.com) or calling 951.616.3600.

Notification of Changes

If we change our privacy policy, we will post a notice of the change on our homepage, so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we would disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Web site 30 days prior to implementing the change. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. 

Legal Disclaimer

We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process served on our website.
