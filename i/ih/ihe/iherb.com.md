# iHerb.com - Privacy Policy

**In a nutshell:**   
Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at iHerb.   
Since our inception back in 1996, iHerb has never shared, rented, or sold any customer information to any other party-- and never will. 

When you submit personal information on our website we will protect your information both online and offline. 

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it. For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited access, secured facilities. iHerb.com employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. 

And as always, iHerb.com will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other parties. And we will only disclose your information to the extent we are required to do so by law or a court order.

iHerb takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no data transmitted over the internet or stored on a server can ever be 100% secured. Therefore, while we strive to protect your privacy and personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted or disclosed to us online. We are not responsible for the disclosure, destruction or theft of your personal information.

If you opted to register with us, you established a password for your account, in which case your online account information will be protected by your password. We suggest that you do not share disclose your password to anyone. You are responsible for the confidentiality of your account and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and password. We suggest creating challenging passwords such as those with alphanumeric combinations. 

**Secure Ordering**

When you submit personal information on our website, your information is protected both online and offline. We can only access your credit card (but not your actual credit card information) to issue credits, never for actual charges. Only you can produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account.

While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon of your web browser becomes locked. This indicates that the connection between your web browser and our web server is secured. While on a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https'. 

When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software which meets or exceeds industry standards - (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

 **Information Collected for Ordering**

When you register with us will provide a login ID and a password to establish the registration. Once registered, you must input your name and address to facilitate ordering and reordering from iHerb. Registration is required to order from us.

During the order process, you will be asked for shipping information name, address, telephone number, email, and choice of payment method. This information is collected in order to process your purchase and is for shipping purposes only.

 **Non-Personal Information Collected**

Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

This information is kept for internal use only to enhance your service and is not shared with others.

 **Live Chat**

iHerb.com uses Live Chat in order to provide an immediate means of asking questions concerning purchase on iHerb.com. Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **Disclosure to Third Parties**

We use third party service providers such as credit card processors and delivery companies to assist us in fulfilling your order. These companies use your information to authorize payment and to deliver your order to you. Otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, or transfer your personal information to third parties. The information you give us is confidential, and will not be sold or given to any individual or company or organization except as required by law or court order. This is our promise to you.

 **Newsletter**

If you did not opt out of receiving our newsletter after placing an order with us, or if you signed up to receive our newsletter while visiting our site, there is a way for you to unsubscribe if you no longer wish to receive our newsletter. To unsubscribe, follow the unsubscribe instructions within the newsletter or email us at info@iHerb.com.

 **Sessions and Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use session ID cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. iHerb Store will place a temporary session when you place an item in your shopping cart. The session is used to maintain the shopping cart and make ordering products easier.

 **Third Parties**

You may have cookies placed on your computer by third party websites that refer you to the Site. Although we do not share your personal information with these third party websites, they may be able to link certain non-personally identifiable information we transfer to them with personal information they collected from you previously. Read the privacy policies of each website you visit to understand their privacy practices. Note that each time you click on links to third party websites; you are subject to the third parties privacy policies.

While we support our customer's privacy protection, iHerb disclaims all liability for third party actions, including without limitation actions with respect to use or disclosure of personal information by third parties.

 **Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

 **Correcting/Updating Personal Information**

If you need to correct or update your personal information (such as your email address), or if you no longer desire our service, you can let us know by emailing our customer support at info@iHerb.com or calling 951.616.3600. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we change our privacy policy, we will post a notice of the change on our homepage, so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we would disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Web site 30 days prior to implementing the change. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. You are encouraged to review this page regularly.

If you reside outside the United States, by using our site you consent to the transfer, processing and use of your information outside your country.
