**Jan 08, 2004** \- iHigh.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [http://www.ihigh.com](http://www.ihigh.com/). 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you will still be able to access our site, but it will not be personalized and you may see the same banners repeated in several areas. 

Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. 

## Links

This site contains links to other web sites that may set cookies. iHigh.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We recommend that you view the privacy policies of other web sites that link to and from our site. 

## Order Forms

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications and bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

## Registration

Our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (like their name, email, address, and phone number), and demographic information (like their title, age, high school name, and student body size). Places where personal information is collected include our "Contact Us" form (where we ask for name, company, email, address, and fax and phone number), and our "Be an iHigh SID" form (where we ask for name, school, email, address, and phone number). This information is used to contact the visitor in order to respond to specific requests for information, or to send information to the visitor on how they can become an iHigh School Information Director (SID). This information is not shared with advertisers or any affiliate company. 

We also ask for personal information in our "Join iHigh.com" form (where we ask for name, title, email, phone number, address, high school name, mascot name, and student body size). We use this information to send the user a confirmation letter and information about our company via email. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor regarding weekly updates and suggestions on how to improve their site, as well as to provide technical support. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

## Contests

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their name, email, address, and phone number), and demographic information (like their school name, gender, grade, and age). This information is collected by our marketing department and we use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. 

If there is any change in the way iHigh intends to use this personal information, we will notify users at least 30 days in advance of our intention and, if applicable, provide users with an opportunity to opt out of these changes.
