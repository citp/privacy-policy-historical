                    information that it collects through iHire, LLC Web Sites. This Privacy Policy applies
                    only to data gathered on any web site under iHire’s control (collectively, the "Sites"
                    as is defined in the Terms and Conditions), and does not apply to any other information

                    for the Sites, which apply to this privacy policy. Please review this Privacy Policy
                    periodically as we may update it from time to time. Each time you visit the Sites
                    or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described
                    in this Privacy Policy at that time. If we materially change our practices with

                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to operate the Sites in an efficient and effective manner and provide users
                    with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, iHire
                    may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email
                    address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users
                    with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our Sites
                    (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information based
                    upon your behavior on the Sites and use this information to do internal research
                    on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect
                    and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a User has
                    just come from (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), the URL a User goes to
                    next (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), a user's computer browser information,
                    mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, text that is typed and Users
                    IP address. You agree that iHire
                    may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you
                    that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings,
                    services, advertisements, educational or other career development opportunities),
                    or provide administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the
                    Sites. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information
                    via email, facsimile or by any other mode of communication provided by you. If you
                    do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any
                    further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.
                    iHire may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its
                    users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous
                    information to prepare reports that it provides to its Users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We do not sell our Users' personally identifiable information to anyone for any
                    reason if the User has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private.
                    iHire reserves the right to retain Users’ personally identifiable information, resumes,
                    cover letters and any other documents indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute
                    personal information (such as their email address, facsimile number or resume) via
                    the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and
                    used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which
                    iHire is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at the Sites by following a
                    link from a iHire affiliate or other affiliate’s web site. If so, please be aware
                    that iHire may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may
                    use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iHire may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure
                    is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law
                    enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of iHire or other users of the
                    Sites. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a
                    third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of
                    iHire. Such disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without
                    notice.

                <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    California law permits its residents to request and receive information about a
                    business’ disclosure of certain categories of personal information to other companies
                    for their use in direct marketing. If you are a California resident and a user of
                    any of the Sites, you can request a copy of this information from iHire by sending
                    an email to customerservice@ihire.com or a letter to iHire at 41 East All Saints

                <h3>Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Employers</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Never give out your social security number to a prospective employer </li>
                    <li>
                        Never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction of
                        any sort
                    </li>
                    <li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. eye color, marital
                        status, etc.) over the phone or online
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Other Privacy Features On the Sites</h3>
                <p>
                    You never need to provide personally identifiable data to search for jobs on our
                    Sites. Logging into the Sites is always optional for you (although logging in does
                    give you access to more information and prospects).
                </p>


                <h3>Post a Resume</h3>
                <p>
                    Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of Employers with open positions
                    each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for
                    you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the
                    Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access
                    and edit your existing resume. Posting your resume gives you the most visibility
                    to the broadest Employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our
                    Candidate Database. Any registered Employer user who purchases access to the database
                    can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your
                    resume).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers,
                    recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties
                    who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your
                    resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or
                    privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly,
                    you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.
