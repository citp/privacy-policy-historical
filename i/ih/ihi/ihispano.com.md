iHispano.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. In addition to providing its users numerous privacy features, iHispano.com has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate in writing our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our site [www.ihispano.com](http://www.ihispano.com/).

iHispano.com collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis.

We do not sell our users' personal information to anyone for any reason. We do not display personal information without our users' permission. When posting resumes, our users decide which companies may have access to their resumes. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which iHispano.com is not responsible.
