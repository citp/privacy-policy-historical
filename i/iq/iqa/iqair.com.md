# Privacy Policy | IQAir North America, Inc.

IQAir has drafted this document, which details how we gather and disseminate information, in an effort to demonstrate our strong commitment to online privacy. Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy policy.

### Use of Internet Protocol Address

We use your Internet protocol (IP) address for several reasons: to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information.

### Use of Registration Information

Our site's registration area requires customers to supply contact information, such as name and e-mail address, and demographic information, such as your ZIP code. We use this information to send you promotional materials from our company. However, users may opt out of these promotional e-mail messages at any time. (See Opt Out/Opt In, below.)

### Use of Order Information

When you place an order, IQAir requests information such as contact information, Social Security number, credit card number and demographic information. The contact information you provide is used to send you orders, company information and promotional material. You can opt out or opt in at any time. (See Opt Out/Opt In, below.) Your financial information is used for the sole purpose of billing you for products and services. Your Social Security number is used to identify you, and demographic data is collected to personalize future visits by displaying the content we feel would interest you most.

### Security

The IQAir web site has been designed with your needs for privacy and security in mind. We follow stringent procedures to protect our servers from attack and use encryption techniques to protect potentially sensitive data. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, for all e-commerce transactions and for all users under a subscription plan, to protect the confidentiality of your personal and transaction information. SSL uses an encryption process to avoid unauthorized access or copying of information across the Internet.

### Children's Guidelines

We do not collect or use any online contact information or identifiable off-line contact information about a child without parental consent. We do not distribute personally identifiable information about children without parental consent. We do not give children the ability to post or distribute personal information without prior consent. We do not entice children with games or contests that would encourage them to disclose personal information.

### Opt Out/Opt In

IQAir allows users to opt out of receiving e-mail from us or our partners. To opt out of our mailing list you can reply to the email you received.

### Disclaimer

This site contains links to other sites. IQAir is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these sites.
