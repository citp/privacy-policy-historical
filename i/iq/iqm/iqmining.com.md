Depending on how you have configured your browser, when you access our website, a small file - a "cookie" - may be created by our server and stored on your computer. The cookie contains a unique session identification number and is used to:

  * Keep track of your online order or change.

  * Ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to where you are located.

  * Personalize your experience by alerting you to features and information that might interest you.




A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. If you arrive at our website with your browser configured to disable cookies, you will not be identified until you register and sign-in. Please be advised that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on this website, such as registering for classes or downloading our trading platform.

**Aggregate Information:**

|    
  | 

We collect certain aggregate information, such as tracking the Internet address of the domains from which you visit our site and analyzing this data for trends and statistics, tracking your IP address (the number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are using the Web), and tracking your browser type.

|    
  | 

We use this aggregate information to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to gather broad demographic information. None of this information is connected with your personal information. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information provided during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of clients).

|    
  |   |    
  | 

**Use of IP Addresses:**

|    
  | 

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our website. When clients request pages from our website, our servers log the requesting clients' IP addresses. We normally will not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that clients' sessions will be logged, but client identity remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a client when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, website, or any person, or where it is otherwise authorized and required by law.

|    
  |   |    
  | 

**Use, Disclosure and Retention:**

|    
  |

|    
  |  We may disclose the personal information to: |    
  |

2- A company or individual engaged by us to perform functions on its behalf, such as research or data   
    processing.  
3- A credit reporting agency.  
4- A public authority or agent of a public authority, if in our reasonable judgment, it appears that there is   
   imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the   
   information.  
5- Where you consent to such disclosure or it is required or authorized by law.

|    
  |   |    
  | 

We may use and disclose employee personal information for a variety of purposes related to commencing, managing or terminating an employment relationship.

|
