To contact us regarding a privacy issue, please send an e-mail to [copro@industrialquicksearch.com](mailto:copro@industrialquicksearch.com). Where applicable, please be sure to include the site, or product so that we may better serve you.

**Technical Information**

We collect information about the services you use and how you use them (e.g., viewing a technical video, visiting an advertiser’s page on our site, or reading an article in the News & Analysis section). This information includes:

**Device Information** We collect device-specific information (e.g., hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information).

**Logging Practices** Industrial Quick Search, Inc. automatically records the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of visitors. The IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer on the internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, the IP address that we collect may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because, with some broadband connections, your IP address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer.

We track pages visited on Industrial Quick Search, Inc.’s websites, the amount of time spent on those pages, and the types of searches done on them. 

Industrial Quick Search, Inc. also captures and stores information that you transmit. This may include:

  * Browser/Device type/version
  * Operating system used
  * Media Access Control (MAC) address
  * Date and time of the server request

**Local Storage** We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.

**Cookies and Web Beacons** Cookies and web beacons are electronic placeholders that are placed on your device by websites to track your individual movements on that website over time. Industrial Quick Search, Inc. uses both session-based cookies (which last only for the duration of the user's session) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device and provides information about the session you are in and waits for the next time you use that site again).

These cookies and web beacons provide useful information to Industrial Quick Search, Inc., enabling us to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of our sites, allows us to track usage behavior, and to balance the usage of our websites on all Industrial Quick Search, Inc. web servers.

Tracking cookies, third-party cookies, and other technologies such as web beacons may be used to process additional information, enable non-core functionalities on the Industrial Quick Search, Inc. website and enable third-party functions (such as a social media "share" link). We may also include web beacons and other similar technology in promotional email messages to determine whether the messages have been opened.

**Third-Party and Co-branded Web Sites** Some Third-Party Content made available through other organizations is maintained on the website of the content provider, and not on the Industrial Quick Search, Inc. site. This means that when you click through to that Third-Party Content, you will be leaving the Industrial Quick Search, Inc. website. It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website owned and operated by Industrial Quick Search, Inc.

Industrial Quick Search, Inc. websites may contain links to other websites. Industrial Quick Search, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.
