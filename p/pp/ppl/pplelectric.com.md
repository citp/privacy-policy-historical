“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive. The use of cookies is now an industry standard and Users will find them on most major websites including this Site. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your web browser and may enable us to recognize you as the same User who was at our Site in the past, and relate your use of the Site to other information about you, such as your Site usage information and Personal Information. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Site, such as by storing your username so you can log in easily, keeping you logged into the Site after you have provided your password, or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information and detect and prevent fraud. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Site or its features. 

As is the case with many Websites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit our Site, and we may associate that with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider.

**Social Networking**

We maintain presence on several social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter and we also incorporate some third party social networking features onto our Site. Through these platforms and features, we receive some Personal Information about you, and this Privacy Notice applies to that information as well. In addition, third party social networking platforms have their own privacy policies that explain how the third parties that provide them will use and protect your information. In accordance with those policies (and your privacy settings within your social networking accounts), information about your activities on our Site may be published to your social network. 

Our Site may include features and functionalities that allow you to share information with us that you have already provided to a third party social networking platform.  For example, you may be able to create an account on our Site or log-in to our Site using your Facebook account or other third party credentials.  If you do so, then Personal Information or other data that you have provided to that third party will be made available to us, pursuant to the third party’s terms and conditions, and you consent to our use of that information in accordance with this Notice.  The information we receive from that third party may depend on the privacy settings you have on the third party site. 

We also may include tools on our Site that allow you to share and/or publicly post content or information from our Site to your profile on a third party social network.  Third party social networking platforms and blogging platforms have their own privacy policies that explain how they will use, protect and share your information, including any information you share on those platforms from our Site, and we encourage you to read those policies.
