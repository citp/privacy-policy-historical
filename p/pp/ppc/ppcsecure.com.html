			<br>

			<h4>Other Ways We May Use Your Information</h4>

			<br>
			<br>
			PPCSecure may also be forced to release personal or account related information to comply with law enforcement, judicial proceedings, or legal matters, to enforce the terms of any of our user agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of PPCSecure, our staff, our clients, or others.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Privacy policy for Visitors to Websites using PPCSecure to track data</h3>
			<br>

			<h4>Purpose of this privacy policy</h4>
			<p>PPCSecure has created this privacy policy to specifically outline what kind of data we collect, how that data is used, and what measures we use to protect and control access to your information.</p>	
			
			<h4>Personal data is not collected or stored </h4>
			<p>PPCSecure does not collect or store any type of personal contact information from the visitors to our client's web pages. Visiting a website with our software installed or services in use will not result in the collection of names, phone numbers, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses or any other type of personal data.</p>	


			<h4>Collection of end-user data</h4>
			<p>If you are a visitor to any client's website using the services of PPCSecure, or you click on one of our client's internet advertisment links, you should fully expect that the following data will be collected and stored: Your IP address, browser type, general geographic location, unique user ID tag generated by a cookie installed on your computer, time of your visit, and the referring webpage or referring search engine, along with whichever keywords you used to find the client's website.</p>				

			<h4>How your data is stored</h4>
			<p>The data collected from your visit to a client's website using PPCSecure's services may be stored at a central server owned or leased by PPCSecure. The data may be stored for a period of up to ten (10) years. The server is located in a secure facility and is protected by strong passwords and physical protection.</p>	
			
			<h4>How your data is used</h4>
			<p>PPCSecure's purpose in collecting your usage data is to clearly identify repeat visitors from the same source in an effort to prevent malicious use of our client's pay-per-click advertisements. No third party other than the specific PPCSecure client or PPCSecure staff will be provided access to your data at any time. Some or all usage data may also be used to create reports which will then be submitted to search engines to obtain a refund or recompense for the PPCSecure client.</p>	
			
			<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
			<p>It is the policy of PPCSecure to use cookies only in an effort to identify repeat visitors from certain PPC Search Engines. The cookie never collects or includes personal data such as the visitor's name, phone number, e-mail address or physical address. It may, however, include unique computer-based information used to positively identify a specific computer on the internet.<br> 
			<br>
			PPCSecure also uses tracking code on our servers to track anonymous information about visitors' activity. This code contacts PPCSecure's servers, receives a response, and submits information to PPCSecure about the visit.</p>	
			
			<h4>Modifications to This Privacy Policy</h4>
			<p>If PPCSecure makes any changes to the way we use your personally identifiable information, we will update this page. We may do so without notice or prior warning. You should check this page every time you visit our website to ensure you are always aware of our current privacy policy.</p>
