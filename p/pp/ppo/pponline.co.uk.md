**Cookies in use – improving our service**

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small files that get put on your computer by websites as you surf them. Typically, they contain just two pieces of information: a site name and unique ID.

We think all the cookies used on our websites are innocuous but that’s for you to judge.

**Anonymous tracking**

We use three cookies on our websites – all are anonymous. They simply collect some basic data to help us manage our sites properly. The information we learn helps us to:

  * Personalise and improve our products, offers and your experience.
  * Manage orders, process payments, and deliver products and services.
  * Display appropriate content, products, services and promotional offers on our websites.
  * Communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers.
  * Prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our websites.
  * Update our records and maintain your account details.
  * Generally improve our websites, platform and customer service.



**The free websites**

We have two cookies at _**Better Soccer Coaching**_. To repeat, they are anonymous.

One collects information in your browser bar, such as the term you used in your Google search, so the website can properly direct you to the page you want. The next time you close your browser this cookie will stop working. It’s a type of cookie known as a “Session” cookie.

The second cookie checks to see whether you’ve visited the site before. If you haven’t, it will show you the box asking you to sign up or click “No thanks” before you can go to the content pages. It’s what they call a “Persistent” cookie, meaning it will have an expiry date. For instance, this one lasts for 90 days. we use it so you don’t have to keep clicking “No thanks” every time you come to the website.

**When you buy stuff (please[click here](http://peakperfor.wpengine.com/PrivacyPolicy.aspx#Security) to read about our website security)**

The websites where you can subscribe to our publications, or buy manuals or DVDs also use a cookie. [Click here](http://www.greenstarmedia.net/) to see a list of all these sites.

The purpose of the cookie on my order pages is to ensure every stage of the purchase runs smoothly and securely. In fact the cookie we use is a “Secure” cookie, which means any information you give us is always encrypted and no one else using the internet can see the data.

**Google and other third party cookies**

Our websites also use Google Analytics (just like virtually everybody else’s) a service provided by Google. They gather anonymous data of how people are using the sites and then provide us with statistics on things like which pages have been viewed most often. This information is really helpful to us in improving our websites. However, you can opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics at:

<http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>

There are many great free things to add to websites these days– from Twitter buttons, YouTube video clips, to Facebook share links. Collectively they can make websites more interesting to you as a site visitor (and hopefully beloved customer). But many of these also come with cookies – that’s the “price of free”.

I understand they collect data anonymously unless you are already logged into their service. How this information is used will depend on your privacy settings with them. I am told that in many cases opting-out of Google Analytics will opt you out of these cookies too.

**Don’t want any cookies?**

While I’d love to offer a cookie-free version of my websites, I simply don’t have the resources to provide and maintain one.

You can remove any cookies already on your machine within your browser settings. The “Help” or “Tools” menu on most web browsers will tell you how to manage, disable and delete your cookies. Here you should also be able to stop receiving cookies from any website in future. However, this may affect how you are able to view websites and the features they can offer you.

If you have your cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

**Your personal information and privacy**

We take pride in being honest, fair, respectful, and courteous to all our customers. We respect your privacy and treat your personal information carefully and sensibly. Any information you provide to us will only be used to better serve your needs and enhance your experience of our websites.

**The emails we send you**

**Protecting your information**

We will never sell, rent or loan customers’ personal information and will only share it with companies who require it to fulfil orders. For instance, with banks and credit card providers, or national and international courier and postal services. These companies then only have access to the information they need to perform their functions. They may not use the information for other purposes and only process it in accordance with our privacy policy and as permitted by the UK’s Data Protection Act.

We would release personal information only if we understood that this would be required to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Green Star Media, our customers, employees, agents and others.
