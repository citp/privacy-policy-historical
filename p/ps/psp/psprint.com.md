| Privacy Policy |

[PsPrint.com](http://www.psprint.com/) is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of our customers. We do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose information about our clients to any other party except as required to process and ship purchases. 

Information Collection

PsPrint is the sole owner of the information collected on [http://www.psprint.com](http://www.psprint.com/). PsPrint collects information from our users at several different points on our website. We use this information to improve the customer experience. 

Registration

In order to use My PsPrint, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give a name and email address. We use this information to contact the user about our services even if they have not placed an order.

Order

We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for credit card authorization and to fill customers orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

Cookies are used by both the My PsPrint and the PsPrint order section in order to uniquely identify users, associate user files with orders, and to enable the shopping basket. Our site cannot be used with cookies turned off.

Log Files

Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This data is not linked to personally identifiable information.

Communications from the Site

Special Offers and Updates:  
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. If you do not wish to receive future emails, send an email to[ remove@psprint.com](mailto:remove@psprint.com).

Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. Both our production and customer service staff use email and phone information to communicate with customers about issues pertaining to their orders.

Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.

Third Party Intermediaries

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Business Transitions

If PsPrint should go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information is to be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [remove@psprint.com](mailto:remove@psprint.com).

Links

Our sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

Supplementation of Information 

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement on the homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.

If customers have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change.
