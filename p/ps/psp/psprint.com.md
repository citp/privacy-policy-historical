# Learn the privacy policy of online printing company PsPrint.

PsPrint is committed to protecting our customers’ privacy. We do not share, sell or otherwise disclose information about our customers to any other party except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies only to [www.psprint.com](https://web.archive.org/) and describes how Deluxe Small Business Sales Inc. doing business as PsPrint ("PsPrint.com", "PsPrint", "we", "us", "our") collects and uses the information you provide on our site. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of the information you provide to our site, and how you can access and update this information. The terms "we", "our", and "us" in this Privacy Policy refer to PsPrint, a Deluxe company, and its affiliates.

#### Information Collection

PsPrint, a Deluxe company, is the sole owner of the information collected on [www.psprint.com](https://web.archive.org/). PsPrint collects information from our users at several different points on our site. We use this information to fulfill your order, send you requested product or service information, respond to customer service requests, send you marketing communications, administer contests, surveys, or sweepstakes you may have entered, and improve the customer experience while on our site. We reserve the right to disclose information about you as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may purchase additional data about our customers from third party sources and combine it with the information we have already collected in order to assist us with our marketing activities.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. PsPrint does not store this information after sending this one-time email.

#### Registration

In order to use PsPrint, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give a name and email address. We use this information to contact the user about our services even if they have not placed an order.  We also collect credit card information if a user places an order on the site.

#### Communications from the Site

Special Offers and Updates: Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals via email offers or direct mail. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. If you do not wish to receive future emails, please see the Choice/Opt-out section below.

#### Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. Both our production and customer service staff use email and phone information to communicate with customers about issues pertaining to their orders.

#### Social Media

Our site includes social media features such as Facebook "Like" and "Share This" buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

#### Blog and Testimonials

Our site offers a publicly accessible blog. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. For testimonials, we obtain the customer's consent prior to posting their name along with their testimonial. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit through testimonials. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us via one of the methods listed below.

#### Cookies and Other Technologies

A cookie is a small data text file that our server sends to your computer and that your computer sends back to us each time you visit our website.  Cookies are used by PsPrint in order to uniquely identify users, associate user files with orders and to enable the shopping basket. You can disable and/or delete cookies by controlling your browser settings. If you do disable cookies, our site will not recognize you, and you may not have access to all portions of the website.  
In addition, we and our partners use technologies similar to cookies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Choice/Opt-out Section below.

We also partner with third parties to display advertising on our website, some of which is based upon your browsing activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

#### Log Files

Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This data is not linked to personally identifiable information.

#### Security

We are committed to protecting your information. Security measures are in place on this site to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We offer industry-standard security measures available through your web browser. When you are on this site, the sensitive information you provide such as credit card and financial information is encrypted with secure socket layer (SSL) technology and scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches us. Please remember that email, which is different from the encrypted sessions above, is not secure. Therefore, we ask that you do not send sensitive information such as credit card or account numbers to us via an unsecured email message.

#### Information Disclosure and Your Choices

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, an email service provider to submit email communications to you on our behalf, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

If PsPrint should go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information is to be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section.

#### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email, emailing us at [remove@psprint.com](mailto:remove@psprint.com) or by following the unsubscribe instructions within the email. Users who no longer wish to receive our direct mails can opt out on this page <https://www.psprint.com/myaccount> by clicking the the 'Remove Me' button under the DIRECT MAIL OFFERS heading.

#### Links

Our site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this site.

#### Notification of Changes

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy on the homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. If we are going to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will post a prominent notice on our site notifying users prior to the change becoming effective.

If customers have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.

#### Access to Correct/Update/Deactivate

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or request that it be deleted/deactivated by accessing your PsPrint account or by contacting us at the address listed in the Contact Information section.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
