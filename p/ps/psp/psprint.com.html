<a href="http://www.psprint.com"><u>PsPrint.com</u></a> is committed to maintaining
the confidentiality of our customers. We do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose
information about our customers to any other party except as required to process
and ship purchases. This privacy statement only applies to <a href="http://www.psprint.com">
    www.psprint.com</a>. This privacy policy describes how Deluxe Corporation ("PsPrint.com", "PsPrint,"
"we," "us," "our") collects and uses the information
you provide on our site. It also describes the choices available to you regarding
our use of your personal information relating to your business and how you can access
and update this information.<p></p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Information Collection</p>
<p>
    PsPrint is the sole owner of the information collected on <u><a href="http://www.psprint.com">
        http://www.psprint.com</a></u>. PsPrint collects information from our users
    at several different points on our site. We use this information to fulfill your order, send you requested product or service
    information, respond to customer service requests, send you marketing communications,
    administer contests surveys or sweepstakes you may have entered, and improve the
    customer experience while on our site.
    We reserve the right to disclose information about you as required by law and when
    we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with
    a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our site.
    We may purchase additional data about our customers from third party sources and
    combine it with the information we have already collected in order to assist us
    with our marketing activities.</p>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will
ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend
a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. PsPrint does not store this
information after sending this one-time email.
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Registration</p>
<p>
    In order to use My PsPrint, a user must first complete the registration form. During
    registration a user is required to give a name and email address. We use this information
    to contact the user about our services even if they have not placed an order.</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Communications from the Site</p>
<p>
    Special Offers and Updates: Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services,
    special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we
    present the option to not receive these types of communications. If you do not wish
    to receive future emails, please see the Choice/Opt-out section below.</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Customer Service</p>
<p>
    We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. Both
    our production and customer service staff use email and phone information to communicate
    with customers about issues pertaining to their orders.</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Social Media</p>
<p>
    Our site includes social media features such as Facebook "Like" and "Share
    This" buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are
    visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
    Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our
    site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of
    the company providing it.</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Blog and Testimonials
</p>
<p>
    Our site offers a publicly accessible blog. You should be aware that any information
    you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access
    them.
</p>
With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish
to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us via one of the methods
listed below.
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Cookies and Other Technologies</p>
<p>
    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about
    the user. We use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored
    on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can
    be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
    Cookies are used by both the My PsPrint and the PsPrint order section in order to
    uniquely identify users, associate user files with orders, and to enable the shopping
    basket. Our site cannot be used with cookies turned off.
</p>
<p>
    Our third party advertising partner, Conversant Media, employs a software technology 
	called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on 
	our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with 
	a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online 
	movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer 
	hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the 
	period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs 
	to our customers' personally identifiable information. To learn more about our advertising 
	company's use of clear gifs, please go to http://www.conversantmedia.com/
</p>
<p>
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out."
</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Log Files</p>
<p>
    Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol
    (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
    platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer
    the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information
    for aggregate use. This data is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Security</p>
<p>
    We are committed to protecting your information. Security measures are in place
    on this site to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information
    under our control. We offer industry-standard security measures available through
    your web browser. When you are on this site, the sensitive information you provide
    such as credit card and financial information is encrypted with secure socket layer
    (SSL) technology and scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches us. Please remember
    that e-mail, which is different from the encrypted sessions above, is not secure.
    Therefore, we ask that you do not send sensitive information such as credit card
    or account numbers to us via an unsecured e-mail message.</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Information Disclosure and Your Choices</p>
<p>
    We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that
    are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information
    to third parties.</p>
<p>
    We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, an email service provider to
    submit email communications to you on our behalf, and a credit card processing company
    to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store
    or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
If PsPrint should go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information
will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the
business transition, the users' personally identifiable information is to be used
in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given
choice consistent with our notification of changes section.
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Choice/Opt-out</p>
<p>
    Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used
    for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information.
    Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications
    may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the
    subject line in the email, emailing us at <a href="mailto:remove@psprint.com">remove@psprint.com</a>
    or by following the unsubscribe instructions within the email.
</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Links</p>
<p>
    Our site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible
    for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware
    when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website
    that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
    solely to information collected by this site.
</p>
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Notification of Changes</p>
<p>
    If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement
    on the homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware
    of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if
    any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy
    under which the information was collected. If we are going to use users' personal
    information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we
    will post a prominent notice on our site notifying users prior to the change becoming
    effective.</p>
If customers have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated
their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information
be used in this new manner.
<p class="paragr_heading">
    Access to Correct/Update/Deactivate</p>
<p>
    If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you
    may correct, update, amend, or request that it be deleted/deactivated by accessing
    your My PsPrint account or by contacting us at the address listed in the Contact
    Information section.</p>
<p>
    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed
    to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to
    comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
