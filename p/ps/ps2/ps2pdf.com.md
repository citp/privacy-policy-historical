## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices.

We collect information to enable the online converter to work, to monitor site activity and to plan for growth and upgrades. 

The primary information we collect is:

  * Name of files submitted to us
  * Size of files (including number of pages)
  * Conversion error messages
  * Network addresses of users



Our automatic processes are designed to delete files converted on our site within 30 minutes of being converted.  In addition our security checks are designed to only allow the same computer that uploaded a file to us to download the converted file.  On rare occasions to insure quality we might view a  converted file on our servers.  Such a viewing will not change when that file will be deleted from our servers nor will we disclose the file contents.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer e-mails we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use cookies to provide additional security for downloading of converted documents and to track unique visits.  Some of our advertisers use cookies.  The Cookies themselves tell us nothing about you personally.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to modify our marketing efforts.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

At times we may share statistical data and conversion error messages with outside parties. This information will be grouped together such that individual conversion data will not be identifiable.

Files downloaded from this site may have a "PDF Producer" string embeded in them giving the version of the converter program that was used as well as the fact that it was converted on the ps2pdf.com website. 

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an e-mail.

We may update this policy from time to time.
