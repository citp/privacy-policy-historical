####  1\. What information is collected on this site?

In order to provide you with certain services on our Site, we may need to collect different types of information. In particular, we occasionally may need to collect certain types of personal information (information that may be used to personally identify or contact you) in order to provide you with particular features, services, or offers. Here's a summary of the kinds of information we collect at the PSE Site, and how we collect that information:  


 **A. Passive Collection**  
Our software automatically collects certain information from your computer when you log on or move about our Site. This information is not linked to any other personal information you tell us, it just gives us a broad picture of who is on our Site and which areas your users are visiting. It is our way of learning what's important to our users and what isn't, and improving our Site to make it more interesting and useful for you. It also enables us to provide improved security and efficiency on our Site. The two main ways in which this general information is collected are through "log files" and "cookies."

 **(i) Log Files**  
Log files are records of user activity collected to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad types of information for aggregate use. The kinds of general information we collect in the log files includes: 

  * The IP address of your computer  

  * How many people visit our Site  

  * Which pages of our Site are visited most often

**(ii) Cookies**  
PSE also uses "cookies" to gauge how users interact with our Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies cannot execute code or deliver a virus to your computer. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information, it merely helps the Site to be more efficient. Typically, a cookie enables your computer to load Web site files faster on subsequent visits. We also use cookies to track a user's path for security purposes, as well as to target your interests in an effort to enhance your experience on our Site. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. If you reject a cookie, you may still use our Site, however, you may be limited in your use of certain areas. Please note: some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on our Site and we have no access to or control over these cookies.

 **B. Active Collection**

####  3\. What Information is Shared with Third Parties?

We will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this policy without first obtaining your authorization

We may disclose personal information you provide to independent contractors, service providers and consultants who are engaged by or working with PSE, consistent will all applicable laws and regulations. We may also use credit card processing companies to process payments for goods and services, outside shipping companies to ship orders and credit bureaus to check credit histories. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services and will share information with them in order to facilitate their provision of services. For example, when the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information necessary for the third party to provide these services. PSE may also contract with outside companies to administer our mailing lists or provide other services. Your personal information may be shared with an outside company for the sole purpose of administering the products, services and programs you have selected. PSE makes an effort to ensure, but does not guarantee, that all third party partners agree to the same high level of privacy safeguards that PSE itself provides to its users.

Additionally, we may share aggregated information (i.e. information we collect that does not allow you to be personally identified or contacted, for example demographic and site usage information) with third parties such as partners and advertisers without your authorization. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

As noted above, information collected by Nexus Energyguide on behalf of PSE on this Site or on co-branded pages is the sole property of PSE but may be used by Nexus Energyguide for the purpose(s) for which it was collected.

PSE reserves the right to share information with third parties if we are required to do so by law or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of PSE, its customers, or the public..

####  4\. What choices do I have in the use and collection of my information?

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our services at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive promotional e-mail materials from PSE may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the e-mail with "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or e-mailing [customercare@pse.com](mailto:customercare@pse.com) and requesting to be taken off the list.

####  5\. What security precautions are taken to protect my information online?

PSE takes reasonable precautions to protect our users' information. Physical, electronic and policy measures are in place to minimize the loss, misuse, or altering of any information we receive from you. When you are asked to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the advanced SSL encryption software. Encryption makes unauthorized access to the information much more difficult.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable precautions to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. In fact, only certain employees are granted access to personally identifiable information. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [customercare@pse.comm](mailto:customercare@pse.com) for more information.
