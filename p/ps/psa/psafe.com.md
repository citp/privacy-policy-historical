This Privacy Policy describes the Personal Information that PSafe collects about its users and visitors, and what can be done with the Personal Information and certain Biometric Data, in order to demonstrate its practices with respect to this important issue.

With this Privacy Policy, PSafe wants to demonstrate that the privacy of its users’ information is a top priority of PSafe and, therefore, that it takes precautions and uses safeguards to protect all information, using the most complete and effective IT security mechanisms commercially available.

This document is an integrated part of the PSafe’s [Terms of Use](https://www.psafe.com/terms-of-use/) and [License Agreement](https://www.psafe.com/license-agreement/). By accepting either of the Terms of Use or License Agreement, the user accepts the policies contained in this Privacy Policy. So, when using any Service, the user acknowledges that the user has read and agreed to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect**

Personal data, including (but not limited to) the users’ name, home address, email address, contact telephone number, and credit card or other billing information (“Personal Information”) may be either required to use some of the Services, or users may have the option of providing such information. Certain of the Services may also require you to have or to create a Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other similar third-party account (each, a “Third-Party Account”) and sign in with the respective Third-Party Account login.  If you do so, you authorize PSafe to access and to use certain Third-Party Account information, as applicable, which may include (but not be limited to) public information in your profile on those Services.  We may collect Personal Information about you from third parties and add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Services. PSafe may confirm the provided Personal Information by consulting with public authorities, specialized companies or databases. The information that PSafe obtains from these entities will be treated confidentially.

If the user elects to activate the anti-theft functions in DFNDR / PSafe DFNDR / DFNDR Security, (i) PSafe will collect certain of the user’s Third-Party Account information (to the extent that such user has included such information in their Third-Party Account and that such information is transferred by the corresponding third party to PSafe upon activation with such Third-Party Account) and (ii) PSafe may access and/or store the GPS location (of the device on which anti-theft was activated) for purposes of providing the anti-theft functionality.

If the user elects activate the facial recognition function offered through DFNDR Vault, the DFNDR Vault application will collect data corresponding to the faceprint of the user (“Biometric Data”).  The facial-scanning and Biometric Data storage software in DFNDR Vault is provided by a third party under license to PSafe.  The Biometric Data is stored locally on the user’s device and encrypted for security purposes.
