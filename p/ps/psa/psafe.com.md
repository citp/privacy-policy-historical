II.  **I** **NFORMATION WE COLLECT**

Personal Information or personal data means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include information where the identity has been removed (“Anonymous Data”).

  * **Identity Information** includes name, username, email address, or similar identifier.

  * **L** **ocation** **Information** includes information about your location using a variety of technologies, such as GPS, IP address, and connected or nearby Wi-Fi networks.



We also collect, use and share **Aggregated** **Information** such as statistical or demographic information for any purpose. Aggregated Information may be derived from your Personal Information but is not considered Personal Information in law as this information does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Information with your Personal Information so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined information as Personal Information that will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We do not collect any **Special Categories** of Personal Information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

III.  **H** **OW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We and our third-party service providers use different methods to collect information from and about you including through:

  * **D** **irect interactions.** You may choose to give us your Identity, Demographic, Contact, Financial, Profile, or Marketing and Communications Information by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by mail, phone, email, or otherwise. This includes Personal Information you provide when you:
  * purchase or subscribe to our products or services;
  * create an account through the Services;
  * subscribe to emails or newsletters;
  * request services or other information;
  * enter a competition, promotion or survey; or
  * give us feedback about products, services, or the Websites.
  * **Automated technologies or interactions.** As you interact with the Websites or Services, we may automatically collect Technical, Usage, and Location Information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this Personal Information by using cookies, pixel tags, embedded scripts and other similar technologies. Please see information about our cookie policies in Section VII.B for further details.
  * **Cookies** – Cookies are small data files that a website sends to your Device while you are viewing the website that are stored on the Device. Cookies can be used for many purposes, including to monitor use of websites, to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to speed up your searches and purchases and to recognize you when you return to websites and/or store your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit websites. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Websites, Services, or our content may not function properly.
  * **P** **ixel Tag** – Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear GIFs, 1×1 GIFs Web beacons, or Web bugs) are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be included on the Websites, Services, and in our e-mail messages. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s Device, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a pixel tag. Pixel Tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites or use the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
  * **E** **mbedded Scripts** – Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Websites and Services, such as the links you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, and is active only while you are connected to the Websites or Services.
  * **T** **hird parties or publicly available sources.** We may receive Personal Information about you from various third parties. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. Examples of third-party sources include:
  * Technical Information from analytics providers;
  * Contact, Financial and Transaction Information from providers of technical, payment and delivery services.
  * Identity, Profile, and Contact Information from publicly available sources, including websites and forums on the internet.
  * **A** **ctivating additional features.** We may receive additional Personal Information about you if you elect to activate optional features or services as set forth below 
    * If you elect to activate the anti-theft functions in _dfndr_ / PSafe DFNDR / DFNDR Security, PSafe may collect Location Information for purposes of providing the anti-theft functionality. (
    * If you elect to use the Identity Theft Report function offered through _dfndr_   _security_ , we may collect your email address as detailed in the [License Agreement](https://www.psafe.com/license-agreement/).



IV.  **T** **HIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS PROVIDERS & AD SERVERS; ONLINE TRACKING**

PSafe works with certain third parties (including network advertisers, ad agencies, and analytics companies) to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, to serve advertisements, including our advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may use Device Identifier and Usage Data to compile reports on user activity. For example, if you clicked on one of our advertisements that led you to our Websites or Services, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and pixel tags) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier, Usage Data and related information about you. Cookies and pixel tags, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you, and assist in providing analytics.

These third parties may also transfer Device Identifier and Usage Data to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process analytics information on their behalf. Each of these third party’s ability to use and share Device Identifier and Usage Data is restricted by their respective Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these third parties in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of third-party analytics services, please contact us at [privacy@psafe.com](mailto:privacy@psafe.com).

We may share Device Identifier and Usage Data about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors to help analyze how users use the Websites and Services. These analytics services may use their own software development kits (SDKs) to collect information such as how often and what features of the Websites and Services users use. We use this information to improve the Websites and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their respective terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information.

While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.

For additional information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members and DAA Self-Regulatory Program participating companies, you may visit:

  * NAI Opt-Out Tool (for website users): <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
  * DAA Consumer Choice (for website users): <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>
  * DAA AppChoices (for mobile app users): <http://youradchoices.com/appchoices>
  * In Loco Media Opt-Out Tool: <https://inloco.co/opt-out/>



Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while visiting the Services and elsewhere online. Some third parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. However, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, the Websites and Services currently do not respond to or alter their practices when they receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

V.  **U** **SE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY PSAFE**

In addition to the above, we may use Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve navigation on the Services. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.

**A.  ** **E** **MAIL COMMUNICATIONS**  
You will receive newsletters or marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have consented receiving marketing communications at that time.

**B.  ** **F** **EEDBACK**  
If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback in accordance with the terms in our Terms of Use and/or License Agreement, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We may publish user feedback from time to time, provided that we will obtain your consent prior to publishing any feedback that is associated with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy, provided that we may contact you in regards to such feedback.

**C.  ** **COOKIES**  
A cookie is a data file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by the user before the expiration date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

Cookies are used to better understand how individuals are using our Websites and Services; cookies will not be used for other purposes unrelated to the operations of PSafe.

Most browsers allow you to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. The methods for doing so vary from browser to browser, and from version to version. You can however obtain information about blocking and deleting cookies for some commonly used browsers via the links below:

Please note that blocking all cookies will have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites and if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to use all the features on our Websites or Services.

Additionally, cookies or other similar systems installed by third parties can be found on certain pages of the Websites or Services.

It is understood that this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Websites or Services and not the use of cookies by advertisers. PSafe does not control the use of cookies by third parties.

VI.  **H** **OW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, in our discretion and without restriction.

PSafe may disclose Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, PSafe may share Personal Information as follows:

**A.  ** **I** **NTERNAL THIRD PARTIES**  
We may share some or all of users’ Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control for a variety of purposes, including for business, operational, and marketing purposes.

You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from PSafe and our affiliated businesses, partners and agents. If you agree at that time to receive such communications, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties). For more information, please refer to the Marketing Communications section.

**B.  ** **E** **XTERNAL THIRD PARTIES**  
_Other Users_

Whenever you create and populate a “shared album” or mark files (“Shared Content”) to share with third-parties in the _dfndr vault_ application, PSafe automatically will upload such Shared Content (which may include Personal Information) to servers managed by PSafe (located in the United States) to permit such sharing with those other users of _dfndr vault_ identified by you. Users of  _dfndr vault_ who accept your invitation to view such Shared Content (or the user who posted the Shared Content, if re-downloading to their own device) automatically will receive a download (in their _dfndr vault_ application) of the shared files in their original sizes.

_Administrative & Legal Reasons_

PSafe cooperates with the relevant authorities and with third parties to ensure compliance with the law, for example in areas such as protection of industrial property rights and intellectual property, privacy and personal data protection, fraud prevention and others.

We may transfer and disclose information, including Personal Information, to third parties:

  * to comply with a valid legal inquiry, investigation, or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order, or if in our opinion such disclosure is required by law;
  * to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, manage risks, obtain professional advice, or establish, exercise or defend legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure;
  * to protect the safety, interests, rights, property or security of PSafe, you, or any third party;
  * to respond to a breach or attempted breach of the security of our Websites or Services;

  * at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation.



We may also use Technical Information to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies in our discretion.

_Third-Party Service Providers_

We may share users’ Personal Information with service providers or “outsourced” companies that improve or facilitate PSafe’s operations or provide services on our behalf such as (but not limited to) transport services, call centers, or loyalty programs, among others. Nevertheless, the user agrees that PSafe is not responsible for the misuse of the user’s personal information by these companies or websites. In some cases, these service providers collect information directly from the user (for example, in the case of purchases through app stores, or requests to conduct surveys or studies). In such cases, the user will receive a notification about the participation of a service provider in such activities and the user will have complete discretion over what information the user wants to provide. To facilitate such situations, and to take care of any additional information directly provided to such service providers, such service providers will use the information in accordance with their own privacy policies.

_Third-Party Payment Processing_

As of the date of this Privacy Policy, all online payments for the Services are handled by either Google Play (<https://play.google.com/store>) or the App Store (<https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/>), depending on the user’s device. We do not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account information, and all transactions conducted on Google Play and the App Store are subject to their respective terms of service available at https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html and <https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html>.  For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/> (for Android devices) or <https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/> (for Apple devices).

_Third-Party Cloud Storage Providers_

As described in the License Agreement, certain Services allow you to “connect” such Services to an account with the following third-party cloud storage providers: Dropbox, Google, and OneDrive (each, a “Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider”). You agree that the information and/or Personal Information you provide to activate and/or use the connection to the Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider, as well as any content or data you have chosen to store (which may include Personal Information) using the Services, may be shared with that Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider. You further agree to be bound by that Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider’s practices with respect to your information and/or Personal Information. You also agree to be bound by any specific provisions set forth by the relevant Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider’s terms of use or privacy policy.  OneDrive allows you to go to the following link at any time to revoke OneDrive’s access to your Personal Information:  <https://account.live.com/consent/manage>.

_PSafe-Provided Cloud Storage_

As described in the License Agreement, if you use the _dfndr vault_ “Private Cloud” service, PSafe automatically will replicate your files to servers managed by PSafe (located in the United States) but owned by a third party. Files stored in the _dfndr vault_ “Private Cloud” are encrypted and only can be viewed through the _dfndr vault_ application. This automatic replication can be disabled – and replicated files can be deleted from PSafe’s servers – by the user at any time in the _dfndr vault_ settings.

_Promotions or Contests_

Winners of any commercial promotions and/or contests conducted by PSafe, or people who participate in PSafe’s loyalty programs, expressly authorize PSafe to share their names, personal data provided to PSafe to participate in the promotion, contest or program, and images (photos), in the ways it sees fit, for the purpose of advertising and/or promotion, without the right to any compensation.

**C.  ** **S** **HARING BETWEEN PSAFE COMPANIES; BUSINESS TRANSFERS**  
We may share and disclose some or all of users’ Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding users’ Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. These transfers and disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

VII.  **Y** **OUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR  
INFORMATION**

YOU CAN STOP ALL COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY OUR APPLICATIONS BY UNINSTALLING THE RELEVANT APPLICATION.

In addition, you have several choices regarding the use of information on our Websites and Services:

**A.  ** **O** **PTING OUT**  
We will communicate with you primarily in the form of emails. You can manage the frequency and/or opt out of receiving these communications by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you services-related communications including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.

You also may contact support@psafe.com to register an “opt-out” request that removes your email from visibility in Identity Theft Report searches, rather than permanently deleting it (to ensure that if the email address appears in information from subsequent Data Breaches obtained by PSafe, it does not become searchable again); note that an email address which is subject to an “opt-out” request may remain searchable if you complete a standard email verification process related to that specific email address.

**B.  ** **C** **OOKIES**  
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from the Websites and/or the Services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please consult your browser’s technical information and review the information in Section VI.D for more information on how to do so.
