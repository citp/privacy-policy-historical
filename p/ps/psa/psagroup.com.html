	PSA Privacy Statement</h2>
<h4>
	July 2014<br>
	PSA Global Privacy Statement: Effective July 01, 2014</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This privacy statement applies to psagroup.com and all PSA websites, services and products that collect or process data and display these terms. It does not apply to any PSA site, service or product that does not display or link to this statement or that contains its own separate privacy statement.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Pacific Strategies and Assessments (PSA) is committed to protecting your privacy including protection against loss, misuse and alteration of data stored and process by PSA.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	This Privacy Policy is designed to describe how we secure and maintain our client’s personal information and any information given to us will never be sold, rented, traded, shared or leased other than as outlined in this Policy.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	PSA does not publish text, images, or multimedia content that portray nudity, foul language, violence or other information not suitable for children and PSA will not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from or about anyone under 13. PSA is committed to complying with privacy laws to which it is subject and adhering to the highest industry standards for privacy including adhering voluntarily to EU privacy laws.</p>
<h4>
	&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>
	<br>
	Collection and Use of Information</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	PSA collects different kinds of information in order to operate effectively. Some of this information is provided directly while other information may be provided or collected from other sources as required by our products and services.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	What information we collect:</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our website does not collect any information nor ask for registration, and does not use tracking cookies or traffic analysis to store any personally identifiable information. The only personally identifiable information collected from our website is collected from the ‘contact us’ form. Any information attained from this source implies consent for use within the scope of this privacy policy.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	PSA does use website traffic logging which enables us to collect anonymous information, but this is limited to completely anonymous information about your browser type and language.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	How we use Personal Information:</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	PSA uses the information we collect to improve our products and services and to respond to requests about products and services offered.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	PSA also provides a mailing alert facility for which we collect names and email addresses. This information is kept securely and used only to provide the requested service. We will never transfer, sell or make available to any others this information except as outlined in this privacy policy. We provide functionality for users to cancel this service at any time and once cancelled all associated data is also removed.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	PSA tracks click behaviour in the e-mails it sends out. This data is collected using clear gifs, tiny invisible images with a unique ID. This data is used to update specific user-profile information, ascertain the topics of most interest to opt-in e-mail recipients, and to generate statistics for internal usage only. These records and any statistics generated are for internal usage only and will not be shared with any third party.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyse trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link automatically-collected data through the use of Cookies and log files to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>
	&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>
	<br>
	Secure Communications</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	PSA will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
	If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an e-mail through our website with "Web Site Security Query" in the subject line.</p>
<h4>
	&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>
	<br>
	Use of Third Party Services</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	PSA contracts with select third parties in connection with the delivery of services to our clients. These third parties may not use any personally identifiable information other than to provide the specific contracted services.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Links to Other Sites</h4>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of PSA. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	<br>
	Terms</h4>
<p>
	<br>
	No company other than PSA is allowed to access information stored on our servers, unless expressly authorized by PSA. Unauthorized access to this information is a violation of the law. PSA has placed security measures and firewalls on all network servers in an attempt to prevent outside parties from accessing private information. In the event of a breach of security, PSA will use legal recourse&nbsp; to the fullest extent possible against those parties illegally accessing information on our servers.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Safe Harbor and EU Privacy Law</h4>
<p>
	<br>

	<br>
	Access to Personal Information</h4>
<p>
