# Privacy Policy | PS4Blog.net

We are the sole owners of the information on this site. We only have access to information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship items won in giveaways.

The chatroom is hosted at Mibbit.com and no information is collected on our site.

Google Analytics collects anonymous data about site pages visits, and this data is anonymously aggregated in different reports.

The comments you leave in the website are hosted at Disqus (read their [privacy policy here](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy)), so no email is collected from a comment you leave at any of our posts.

For giveaways we use Gleam.io (read their [privacy policy here](https://gleam.io/privacy)), a user-initiated opt-in, and we don’t have access to emails unless you win a giveaway. If you do win a giveaway, your email is solely used to contact you as a winner to send you your prize. Emails are never shared and only the avatar and user name are displayed for winners, as per the user opt-in to enter the giveaway.
