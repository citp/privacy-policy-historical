# Grohol.com . Privacy statement

The following site properties are governed by this Privacy Statement, and are online interactive services owned and managed by Liviant LLC: 

  * Grohol.com 
  * PsychCentral.com 
  * Enpsychlopedia.com 
  * Liviant.com 
  * Telepsych.org 

These sites currently do not collect any personally identifiable information regarding our visitors, except during the voluntary registration process for our discussion forums, or when a person emails us directly. 

**Information Collection**   
Liviant LLC is a private Delaware company owned exclusively by Dr. John M. Grohol. There are three ways we collect data on this Web site: 

  * Discussion forums (Used for registration and posting only; active; voluntary) 
  * Direct private emails to us (Used to reply to your email only; active; voluntary) 
  * Statistical log information (Used for traffic trends analysis only; passive; involuntary) 

All data collected and managed by Liviant LLC Web sites, as noted above, is used exclusively by Liviant LLC and is not shared with any third-party. All data except the statistical logs require active participation on your part. If you don't want to participate in our discussion forums or send us an email, we will not know anything personally-identifiable about you. Statistical log information, used only for aggregate analyses, is the only passive data method we use. As used by most Web sites online today, our Web server makes a note every time a computer accesses our server with the day, time, resource accessed, and resource referred by. We use this data to compile daily Web stats on our sites, and no personally identifiable information is available from this information. 

If you fail to provide the requested information to register on our discussion forums or send us an email, you may be unable to actively participate in our forums, or receive a reply to your email. The only way to opt-out of our Web site traffic analysis is to stop visiting this Web site. 

All data maintained by Liviant LLC Web sites is secured by industry-standard methods, such as requiring unique usernames and passwords, secure connections, and restricting access authorization levels to only appropriate personnel. 

**Choices and Consent**  
You have a choice about how we use your information here. We've already told you that we only use the information you provide us for the intended purpose. We never place people on a mailing list or contact people for marketing or other purposes. We never share the information we collect on this Web site with other third-parties. But if you still want out, just email us and let us know. We'll remove all traces of your presence on our sites to the best of our abilities. 

**Viewing Your Account**  
The only place you have an account with us is in our discussion forums on Grohol.com/PsychCentral.com. You are welcomed to view and edit your profile anytime by simply logging into the [discussion forums](http://forums.grohol.com/). 

**Security of Your Data**  
Hey, who wants data to be floating out in cyberspace without security? Not us, that's for sure. That's why all of our servers are located in physically-restricted collocation facilities, and are secured with strong usernames and passwords for administrative access. Databases are password-secured, and information is restricted to only authorized Liviant LLC personnel who need that information in order to perform their assigned duties and responsibilities. 

**Discussion Forums**  
During the voluntary registration process for our discussion forums, you may be asked for various identifying information, such as your name and e-mail address. **All** information gathered in this process is used exclusively for the registration process; this information is not shared with any third-party for any reason whatsoever. 

Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the discussion forums of any Liviant LLC Web site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Liviant LLC.  **Funding & Advertising**  
Some Liviant LLC Web sites, such as PsychCentral.com, work with third-parties that serves ads to this site. We have read and agree with the [DHN privacy policy](http://www.digitalhealthcare.com/privacy.html) (banner ads) and the [Google privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) (text ads). We hate to tell you, but you should read them too. If you don't agree with their privacy policies, you will find a link at the end of it which allows you to quickly and easily opt out of the DHN advertising.
