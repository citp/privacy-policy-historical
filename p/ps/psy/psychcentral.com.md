# grohol.com . privacy statement

All site properties managed by grohol.com (including Psych Central) currently do not collect any personal information regarding our visitors, except during the registration process for our discussion forums. 

**Discussion Forums**  
During the registration process for our discussion forums, you may be asked for various identifying information, such as your name and e-mail address. **All** information gathered in this process is used exclusively for the registration process; this information is not shared with any third-party for any reason whatsoever. 

Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the discussion forums of any grohol.com property, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of grohol.com. 

**Advertising**  
grohol.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. This site uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data typically through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>. 

All proceeds from monies collected from this Website as an Amazon.com affiliate or from advertising are reinvested directly into the Website. Any extra monies are donated to the [National Parkinson Foundation](http://www.parkinson.org/). That makes this a nonprofit Website, although I know I'll never get around to filing for it. If you're a lawyer or know a lawyer who enjoys doing a little pro-bono work on the side, [drop me a note](https://web.archive.org/feedback.htm). 

**Affiliate Programs**  
Some grohol.com properties may be members of affiliate programs, where the property receives a commission for each sale made from the program. No information is shared with the affiliate program, outside of the fact that the grohol.com property referred the individual to the program. 

**Statistical Data**  
grohol.com properties reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the properties. 

The foregoing policies are effective as of November 1, 1999. grohol.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. 

**Enhanced Privacy**
