<h2>Psych Central Privacy Policy</h2>
<img align="bottom" border="0" src="/images/line1.gif" alt="____________________">
</div>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Policy applies to all  of the services offered by Psych Central, its subsidiaries, and affiliated  companies (collectively, Psych Central's "services"). If you have any  questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us through our website  or write to us at: Chief Privacy Officer, Psych Central, PO Box 5464, Bradford MA 01835 USA.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect and how we use it</strong></p>
<p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register  for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as accessing  psychoeducational information found on Psych Central. In order to provide  additional services, however, we may collect the following types of  information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Information you  provide</strong> - When you sign up for a Psych Central Account or other Psych Central  service that requires registration (e.g., for our community, blogging services,  etc.), we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address  and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your  account with information from other Psych Central services or third parties in  order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our  services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of  combining such information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies</strong> - When you visit Psych Central, we send one or more cookies -- a small  file containing a string of characters -- to your computer that uniquely  identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service  by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people  search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset  your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some Psych Central features and services may not function properly if  your cookies are disabled.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Server log information</strong>  - When you use Psych Central services, our servers automatically record  information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server  logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol  address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and  one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>User  communications</strong> - When you send email or other communication to Psych Central,  we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond  to your requests and improve our services.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Affiliated sites</strong>  - We offer some of our services in connection with other web sites. Personal  information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Psych Central in  order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with  this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we  encourage you to read their privacy policies. Psych Central may sometimes may offer content that is  sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these  relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information  that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. Psych  Central will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable  information if these third parties will obtain such information.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Advertising services</strong> – Psych Central may use  its own internal ad server or a reputable third party to present or serve website  advertisements. These internal or third party ad services may use cookies, web  beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such  advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements'  effectiveness. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Links</strong> - Psych  Central may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether  these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality  of our search technology, customized content and advertising. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Other sites</strong> -  This Privacy Policy applies to websites and services that are owned and  operated by Psych Central. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as  external links from within our various services. These other sites may place  their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit  personal information from you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Psych Central only processes personal information for the  purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for  specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Providing our  products and services to users, including the display of customized content and  advertising; </li>
  <li>Auditing,  research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
  <li>Ensuring the  technical functioning of our network; and</li>
  <li>Developing new  services. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about how we process personal  information by referring to the privacy notices for particular services.</p>
<p><strong>Choices for personal information</strong></p>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires  registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this  information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected,  then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes  other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service  notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal  information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive  information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in  the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our  services, in which case Psych Central may not be able to provide those services  to you.</p>
<p><strong>Information sharing</strong></p>
<p>Psych Central only shares personal information with other  companies or individuals outside of Psych Central in the following limited  circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have your  consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal  information.</li>
  <li>We provide such  information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted  businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our  behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based  on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other  appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
  <li>We have a good  faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information  is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal  process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of  Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,  prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d)  protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Psych  Central, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. </li>
</ul>
<p>If Psych Central becomes involved in a merger, acquisition,  or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before  personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy  policy.</p>
<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of  aggregated, non-personal information. Such information does not identify you  individually.</p>
<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional  questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Information security</strong></p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against  unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of  data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and  processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security  measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store  personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Psych Central  employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to  operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by  confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination  and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Data integrity</strong></p>
<p>Psych Central processes personal information only for the  purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any  applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection,  storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and  process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We  take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is  accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or  correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing and updating personal information</strong></p>
<p>When you use Psych Central services, we make good faith efforts  to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct  this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is  not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business  purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information  requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests,  and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or  systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy  of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning  information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise  required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we  perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a  disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to  access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details  for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these  services.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Psych Central regularly reviews its compliance with this  Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this  Policy or Psych Central's treatment of personal information by contacting us  through this web site or by writing to us at: Chief Privacy Officer, Psych  Central, PO Box 5464,  Bradford MA 01835 USA.</p>
<p>When we receive formal written complaints at this address,  it is Psych Central's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or  her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities,  including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints  regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Psych Central  and an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this policy</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to  time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit  consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will  post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we  will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email  notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified  at the top of the page by its effective date.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this  Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at:  Chief Privacy Officer, Psych Central, PO    Box 5464, Bradford MA 01835 USA.</p>
