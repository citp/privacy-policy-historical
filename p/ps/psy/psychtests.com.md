1.3.5 Tests

The extensive battery of psychological tests is PsychTest's signature feature. Information gathered from test-takers allows us to conduct scientific studies, validate our assessments and fine-tune them based on the results and conclusions drawn from the statistical analyses.

All test questions must be answered before the test can be scored. At some point during the test administration, you may receive a Validation study form. This is a set of demographic and psychographic questions that are not used to score the test; rather, this information serves as a benchmark of a specific characteristic (also called a criterion measure). We then statistically analyze the test and the validation information to see how well the test scores predict the criterion.

What information is collected:

  * All answers entered into the online questionnaire form (answers to all questions administered to you are required to score the test). 
  * All information entered into the Validation study form (all optional). 
  * If you are logged into your account, your username/email address is automatically recorded. If you are not logged in, you are considered to be a "guest".
  * Session ID is recorded.
  * IP number is recorded.
  * Date and time stamp are automatically recorded. 



Why: To conduct scientific studies, validate our assessments and publish articles with our findings on the website and in scientific literature.

How: Data collection is done using an online form; the data are stored in a database.

Your options: If you wish to take a test anonymously, you can take it as a guest (without logging into your account). The report of any test taken anonymously will not be saved (unless purchased) but test data will be recorded for statistical purposes. You have the option to participate in our validation study by answering a set of questions that are not part of the assessment. If you don't wish to participate, simply skip the validation questions. 

Your control: You can change or remove information from your account at any time. To do so, log into your account, click on "Account Information" in the left navigation menu and modify your information. 

Access: Authorized database administrators have access to all data stored in our databases. Authorized customer service representatives access your data if a problem with your account is reported. Our statisticians and psychologists have access to the data sets. All data are treated anonymously. Aggregated results and conclusions drawn from the data are distributed to the psychological community and general public. 

2 Business transitions
