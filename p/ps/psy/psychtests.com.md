Validation of Tests

Occasionally we gather data in order to further validate our tests. Each visitor has the choice of submitting his/her information for validation purposes. Even in this instance, PsychTests.com never uses individual data (name, place of residence, etc.); only aggregated (collective) databases are used for purposes of test validation.
