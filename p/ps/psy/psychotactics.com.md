# Privacy - Psychotactics

### Does Psychotactics.com Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with our affiliated businesses. We provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses.

While we make every effort to give you the best advice we can, we indemnify ourselves against any change in policy or tactics of our partners. You are requested to do your own due diligence, if you should have any doubts.

• **Agents:**  We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analysing data, processing credit card payments, and organising workshops. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

• **Business Transfers:**  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Psychotactics.com, some or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

• **Protection of Psychotactics.com:**  We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Psychotactics.com, our users, or others.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

• **With Your Consent:**  Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

### How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

### What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request via email to renuka@psychotactics.com to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

### OPT-OUT

If you are a newsletter subscriber, you always have the option of no longer receiving them. At the bottom of each newsletter there is an opt-out option. Simply click on “Please click here to unsubscribe”.

### Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service

### How we protect your data

Only authorised directors of Psychotactics Ltd., have access to the information that you give us when you subscribe or become a member. NO ONE ELSE has access to this information and it will never be sold or rented.

### Children

Psychotactics.com does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use Psychotactics.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
