We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company (if we have one in the future), any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, " **Affiliates** "), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Horoscope.com operates multiple web sites, including Astrocenter.com, Horoscope.com, and Psychiccenter.com, and we may share your Personal Data with, and receive Personal Data from, all of the web sites operated by Horoscope.com.

Co-branded Service Offerings.** We may enter into agreements with certain businesses (each, a " **Partner Company** ") pursuant to which we provide the Partner Company with a URL and a customer registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the Partner Company, and the Partner Company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. A Partner Company may want access to Personal Data that we collect from its customers. As a result, if you register on a website through a Partner Company, we may provide your Personal Data to the Partner Company. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our Partner Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.

Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. In addition, where we ask for your Personal Data and you are notified that the information we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, and in cases where you opt-in to share your Personal Data with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy.
