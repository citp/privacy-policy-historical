## Our commitment to data security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

## How secure is my information?

This site uses state-of-the-art digital encryption and security technologies to protect the privacy and security of our members' information and has specific security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All data passing from your computer to this site via HTTPS is authenticated and encrypted using 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. This is the most advanced level of encryption available today, and it means that any information sent from your computer is scrambled in such a way that makes it completely unintelligible if intercepted. When you are on a secure section within this site, a padlock will appear at the bottom (or top) of your web browser's screen. This is your assurance that the encryption is in place and that you are communicating across a secure link.

## How we use your information

The personal information you provide when placing an order is used only to complete your order. We do not share this information with outside parties.

The e-mail address that you provide in the contact/order form is used only to notify you about the status of your order and to send you occasional P2H™ newsletters. We do not use this e-mail address for any other purpose, and we do not share it with outside parties.

For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of individuals visited some area of our site, but we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to those described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
