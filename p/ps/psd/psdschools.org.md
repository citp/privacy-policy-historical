 **Anonymous Data and Cookies**

The Poudre School District website may place a small text file, called a "cookie", in the browser files of your computer. A cookie is used to track your session on the website as you traverse different pages. It is used by the server to differentiate you from another user. It is completely anonymous and does not contain any personal information about you. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being set. If you choose to not accept cookies, the website may not perform as expected.

The entire Poudre School District website is kid safe and contains no material that would be considered offensive or meant for adult users only. If you feel any portion of the website content is questionable please [contact us](http://www.psdschools.org/contact).

 **Log files**  
The District uses Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. IP addresses are used to gather broad demographic information, such as a visitor's country, operating system, browser types, frequency of visit, and so on.

 **Security**  
Poudre School District takes reasonable precautions to protect your personal information. When you submit information via the website, it is protected both online and off-line. When personal information is required, that information is stored in a secure location on our server. This information is not accessible from the web.  All user information is restricted to authorized employees.
