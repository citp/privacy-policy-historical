International Orders Terms and Conditions

**International Shipping Terms and Conditions** Please read the following terms and conditions carefully to avoid additional charges or delayed delivery of your order.

**Prices and Exchange Rate:** Prices shown in currencies other than US Dollars are estimates based on current exchange rates. We will charge your credit card in US Dollars on the day your order is shipped, and the conversion to your local currency will be done at the prevailing rate by your credit card issuer.

**Payment:** All payments must be received in U.S. dollars. We accept money orders, wire transfers, Western Union and preprinted checks. **We do not accept international credit cards**.

**U.S. Power / Voltage:** Products are U.S. models and may have power/voltage requirements different from that of the destination country..

**International Shipping Fees, Import Duties and Taxes:** All International shipments will be charged postage costs calculated by weight and destination. **PSSL.com's prices do not include customs fees, taxes and tariffs for shipments outside the United Sates and Canada.** Customers outside of the United States and Canada may be subject to customs fees and/or import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. You, the customer, are solely responsible for any additional customs clearance fees; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be.

**International Returns or Packages Refused:** If the package(s) is returned to us because of an address error made by the customer, the customer refuses the package or the items ordered are not allowed into the country by customs, **the customer will be responsible for all the shipping costs relating to the shipment**. If the package is stopped by customs because items ordered are not allowed in the country and the package is abandoned, there will be no credit to the customer for the order.

**Your Country's Custom and Import Policies:** Please note: It is important for you to become familiar with the Customs policies for your specific country before ordering. Customs regulations vary greatly by country and lack of knowledge regarding the customs rules governing the country you're importing to can result in your order incurring high import duties, delivery being delayed, or the order being returned to us. It is your responsibility to check with your Customs office to see if your country permits the shipment of our products. Additionally, when ordering from PSSL.com, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you reside and are receiving the goods. Any fees charged to PSSL.com due to non-compliance with your country's laws and regulations will be charged to you, the importer.

Huge Inventory & On-Line Stock Status

Something we're quite proud of! Our multi-million dollar inventory ensures that most of PSSL.com's orders ship out the same day they are placed. Get the gear you need NOW! No waiting, no hassles.

At PSSL.com you'll know the stock status of item before you order. No surprises, no excuses - what you see is what you get. Items that are in stock clearly state "In Stock", items that are out of stock show the anticipated day your order will ship if you place your order today. Our inventory is accurate and we won't tell you something is in-stock when it isn't. Any order placed on the weekends will be shipped on the next business day. Business days are Monday through Friday. 

Backorders

We regularly stock every item we carry. Although every attempt is made to maintain inventory of each product, occasionally a product may be on back order. If any product is not in stock for an order, we will hold the shipment of your entire order until all products are available. In the event your order contains an item that is not in stock, your order will show the approximate ship date based on when we expect the item to reach our warehouse. If you would like the in stock portion of your order to ship now, you can:

  * Place separate orders: Place one order for the items that are in stock and another for the items that are on back order.
  * Contact us by email or phone and let us know that you would like the backorder items to ship separately and to release the in stock items. There will likely be additional shipping and handling fees.
