### What personal information does PoliceOne collect from me?

PoliceOne collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, PoliceOne asks all users for your name, date of birth, email address, city, occupation, department information, industry and personal interests.  Once you register you are no longer anonymous to PoliceOne - you will select an appropriate PoliceOne username and then given access to PoliceOne's many offerings.

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information (such as the above) at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by PoliceOne and/or our many partners; when you post a PoliceOne Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact PoliceOne we may keep a record of that correspondence. PoliceOne also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever PoliceOne collects personal information we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

### What are cookies/tracking technologies and how does PoliceOne use them?

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by PoliceOne and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to:

1\. Remind us of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie passes your username and password when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. Other submitted personal information such as occupation and city are not linked to cookies.

2\. Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing PoliceOne is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.

3\. Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a PoliceOne-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.

4\. Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of PoliceOne's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on PoliceOne a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.

When you are on a PoliceOne site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with PoliceOne alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some PoliceOne services, like BLUtube, are offered as a brand of PoliceOne using the same infrastructure and member database.  This information is stored within a cookie during login and not otherwise collected by a partner company for any purpose.  If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than PoliceOne, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.  Our privacy policy does apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites.  You should read the privacy statement of our co-branded partner. If you have any questions about the use of your information by co-branded sites or experience login problems on a co-branded site please visit the [technical support section](http://www.policeone.com/TechnicalHelp/).

Promotions that run on PoliceOne may be sponsored by companies other than PoliceOne or may be cosponsored by PoliceOne and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

Please be aware that PoliceOne advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personal information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to PoliceOne are not covered by this privacy statement. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.

### With whom does PoliceOne share my information?

As a general rule, PoliceOne will not disclose any of your personal information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors: PoliceOne may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data collected during a PoliceOne promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If your personal information will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give PoliceOne permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.

Merchants listed on PoliceOne have separate privacy and data collection practices. PoliceOne has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link.

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, PoliceOne will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them. If you wish to no longer receive materials from these third parties, please contact them directly.

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, PoliceOne may match user information with third party data. Also, PoliceOne discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 75% of our users are male and are interested in firefighting) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

### Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

Access to your personal information is restricted to our employees, agents, representatives and service providers and entities for whom we are acting as an agent, licensee or publisher, such as societies and our affiliated group companies, for the purposes set forth above. Service providers are only allowed to use your personal information _only as necessary to provide_ these services to us.

With your consent, we also may share your personal information with our affiliated group companies and/or with non-affiliated third parties that wish to send you information about their products and services that may be of interest to you, and users who have consented to receive such information may receive communications from these third parties.

We will not otherwise disclose any personal information without your consent except under the following circumstances:

Only PoliceOne (or agents working on behalf of PoliceOne and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information.

### What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

Your PoliceOne Account Information and PoliceOne Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your PoliceOne Account Information and PoliceOne Profile by using your PoliceOne ID and password.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PoliceOne will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your PoliceOne account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PoliceOne cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

### What security precautions are in place to protect the identity and security of Law Enforcement officials on PoliceOne?

PoliceOne has taken several precautions to protect the identity, account names and passwords of officers when they register and log on to PoliceOne.com. All transfer of registration and login information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Unfortunately, this process cannot be 100% secure and PoliceOne is not responsible for the misuse of these user names and passwords. Despite all of our precautions, you use PoliceOne at your own risk.

We periodically post member testimonials on PoliceOne which may contain personal information such as the member's username. We do obtain the member's consent prior to posting each testimonial. If you have any questions regarding testimonials on PoliceOne or would like a testimonial that includes your personal information removed please [contact us](mailto:support@policeone.com).

Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
