Our website provides links to third-party websites that we do not operate, control or maintain. Our website also may contain third-party ads.

We do not operate the Polaroid Originals website and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of Impossible America, Corp. (its Privacy Policy may be found [here](https://polaroidoriginals.com/pages/terms-conditions)). We urge you to read the privacy policies of all [third-party websites](https://web.archive.org/third-party-partners) and [third-party advertisers](https://www.polaroid.com/third-party-partners) to learn more about their privacy practices and policies.
