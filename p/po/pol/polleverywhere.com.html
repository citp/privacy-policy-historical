We use this information to facilitate individuals’ participation in polls.</li>
<li>In some cases, you may be able to purchase services from us, in which case we’ll also collect payment card information from you.</li>
<li>In addition to providing polling services directly to individuals, Poll Everywhere also has business customers, such as employers or companies that organize conferences.

<h3>Compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”)</h3>
<p>FERPA protects personally identifiable information contained in students’ education records from unauthorized use or disclosure.  If you are an educational institution, or a teacher or school official at an educational institution, that is required to comply with FERPA, we will only use any education records (as defined under FERPA) that you may make available to Poll Everywhere for the purpose of providing the Services to you. We will never share or sell FERPA-protected information, or use it for any other purpose, except as otherwise directed or permitted by you. If a parent or eligible student requests access to any education records that are hosted on our servers, we will help facilitate such access.</p>
<h3>EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield and the GDPR</h3>
<p>Poll Everywhere has self-certified to and complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland, respectively, to the United States. Poll Everywhere also complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”). <a href="/privacy-shield-policy">View our Privacy Shield Policy</a>.  References to “this Privacy Policy” include the Privacy Shield and GDPR Policy.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>What information does Poll Everywhere collect from Visitors?</h3>
<p>Poll Everywhere only collects technical information, such as device and browser type, from Visitors to the Site or mobile Site. Visitors commonly chose to provide personal information, however, as part of using our service, such as answering a poll that asks for a Visitor’s name. In addition, when Visitors participate in polls using a mobile device, the poll response includes the Visitor’s mobile phone number.</p>
<h3>What information does Poll Everywhere collect from Users?</h3>
<p>To register to use some parts of the Service, you must provide a full name and email address. To purchase service, we also require your payment information. Poll Everywhere only collects this personal information if a Visitor chooses to register with the Service to become a User. We may collect information related to how you logged in (e.g., through a mobile app or a browser) so we can alert you to new features about the Service.</p>
<p>Poll Everywhere may use your registration information to contact you to: deliver the Service and improve our Site, Service, features and content, and provide customer service; administer and enable your use, enjoyment and navigation of our Site, Service, and mobile Site; better understand your needs and interests; fulfill requests you make; and personalize your experience.</p>
<h3>How does Poll Everywhere collect information from Visitors or Users?</h3>
<p>Poll Everywhere may collect non-personal information during your visit to the Site or mobile Site through our automatic data collection tools, which may include “cookies” and other commonly used technologies.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data stored by a user’s browser that contains session information to identify you for access purposes as you navigate Poll Everywhere. Cookies are required to use our service.</p>
<p>When you visit our Site, ad networks and other parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.</p>
<p>Some of our Services, such as mobile applications, may collect geo-location data to provide location-related functionality. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you. You may stop sharing your location data by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instruction on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.</p>
<h3>Who can see my polls?</h3>
<p>By default, the polls you create and their results are indexed by search engines and searchable by other Poll Everywhere Users. You can disable this sharing feature in your account settings.</p>
<p>Even if you have enabled the privacy setting to prevent indexing, every poll on our system is assigned a permanent, private, obscure link. This is called a “permalink”. If you share the permalink with others, they will be able to see your poll and a limited subset of data about the responses. If you’ve chosen to allow it, they will be able to submit responses.</p>
<h3>Does Poll Everywhere create user profiles of everyone who visits the Site?</h3>
<p>No. Poll Everywhere uses cookies to facilitate the Service’s functionality and to preserve User preferences. When you visit the Site or mobile Site, Poll Everywhere may place a cookie in order to improve your experience by recognizing you when you visit. But Poll Everywhere does not use cookies to create profiles of Visitors or Users.</p>
<p>Poll Everywhere also does not use cookies or other information gathering tools to automatically collect personal information from Visitors to the Site or mobile Site. We only receive personal information when you choose to provide it.</p>
<h3>What other parties can see me on Poll Everywhere?</h3>
<p>As explained above, Poll Everywhere uses a select number of service providers to help facilitate our Service. We may employ independent companies or other third parties and individuals to help us provide, facilitate or improve our Service (such as customer service support). They are permitted to use data only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf or at an aggregate level. Notable third party services you should be aware of include Facebook and their “like” button, and web analytics providers like Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Some features may expose your presence on the service. For example, if you are interacting with a poll from a presenter, they can see your responses. If you give them permission, they can also associate your responses with your name and email address.</p>
<h3>How does polling work for Poll Everywhere’s business customers?</h3>
<p>In addition to providing polling services directly to individuals, we also have business customers, such as employers or companies that organize conferences. When our business customers conduct polls using our software, we share participants’ information with the customers. Business customers may configure the polling software to collect additional information about poll participants. We require our business customers to explain their privacy practices to poll participants.</p>
<h3>Is there an age restriction for joining Poll Everywhere?</h3>
<p>Poll Everywhere is committed to protecting the privacy of young children, and therefore does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Site or Service from persons under 13 years of age, except in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (‘COPPA’). Accordingly, children under the age of 13 may only use the Site or the Service with the permission and supervision of their parents. Additionally, teachers and schools seeking to use the Site or Service in the classroom with children under 13 years of age are required to obtain the express consent of such children’s parents in compliance with COPPA, prior to permitting such children to access or use the Site or Service.</p>
<h3>Can I invite others to join Poll Everywhere?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you’d like to do that, we will ask you for the individual’s email address for the sole purpose of inviting them to the Service. They are not added to our email list unless they register.

<p>Where your personal information has been requested by any governmental entity or other third party pursuant to subpoena or similar legal process, we will notify you as quickly as practicable before providing any such information, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so or we believe in good faith that disclosure is or may be necessary to protect life, avoid serious physical injury or property loss or damage, or to prevent or investigate an ongoing crime.</p>
