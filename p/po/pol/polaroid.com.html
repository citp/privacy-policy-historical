<li><label>Q:</label> What information do we collect?</li>
<li><label>A:</label>Polaroid.com gathers information to learn about our customers and persons that register for an account on Polaroid.com as well as to assist us in personalizing and improving your experience at Polaroid.com. We gather the following types of information:
<ul>
<li><span>User Provided Information:</span> We obtain and store the information that you enter on Polaroid.com or provide to us in another way. For example, you may be asked to provide your name, address, phone numbers, email address, social network affiliations and login information, preferences, demographic information, credit card numbers and details and other personal information. We may ask you about your buying preferences, economic status and age. You have the right not to provide us with certain information; however, that may limit your ability to fully utilize the benefits of Polaroid.com. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as building a social community, personalizing your visits to Polaroid.com, improving Polaroid.com, communicating with you and responding to your comments, questions or product orders. Keep in mind that you provide such information when you register as a member, search, buy, bid, register a product, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service.</li>
<li><span>Information from Email Communications:</span> We may use a third party vendor to conduct email marketing. We (or our third party vendor) may track whether or not you open our emails so that we can tailor our emails for what interests you. We (or our third party vendor) also use your email information to determine whether we already send you messages so that we do not send you multiple emails. If you do not want to receive information from Polaroid.com, you may decline to receive it (or "opt out") when you provide personal information to Polaroid, or you may visit http://www.polaroid.com and update your account.</li>
<li><span>Automated Information / Cookies:</span> We obtain and store certain types of information each time you access Polaroid.com. We use "cookies" to assist us in remembering important information about you so that Polaroid.com's operation is more convenient for you. See below for a detailed description about "cookies." In addition, when you access Polaroid.com, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This may include information such as your web request, your interaction with a service, internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li>
<li><span>Third Party Information:</span> We sometimes obtain information about you from other sources to supplement the information provided by you. For example, we receive updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your future purchases; account information, purchase and redemption information, and information about your interaction from some merchants with which we partner or for which we provide other services; and credit history and information from credit reporting firms, which we use to help prevent fraud and to assist us evaluating our customers. In addition, when you link your Polaroid.com account to other social networks, we store authentication tokens for each social network that you link to Polaroid.com. You can manage and revoke access to Polaroid.com through each social network that you link to Poalroid.com. You should be aware of the specific privacy policies and terms of service for each social network with which you link to your Polaroid.com account. Those are not part of Polaroid.com.</li>
<li><span>Third Party Applications:</span> Polaroid may make available third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through Polaroid.com. The information collected by Polaroid when you enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by their privacy policies.</li>
<li><span>Updates and Changes:</span> You can update or add to your personal information, but please keep in mind that we may keep a copy of the prior information for our internal records.

<li class="dontsplit"><label>Q:</label> What information do we share?</li>
<li><label>A:</label>We share your information only as described below:
<ul>
<li><span>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</span> We work closely with affiliated businesses, generally licensees of the Polaroid brand and their fulfillment partners who sell their products on Polaroid.com. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. <span>Third-Party Service Providers:</span> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are not authorized to use it for purposes beyond their engagement or transmit it beyond their usage.</li>
<li><span>Promotions:</span> From time to time we may send offers to selected groups of Polaroid.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive these types of offers from Polaroid.com, please adjust your preferences in your account.</li>
<li><span>Mergers or Business Transactions:</span> As we continue to grow our business, we might enter into agreements to buy or sell businesses or assets, including customer information. If customer information is sold, it remains subject to the promises made in the applicable Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). It is also possible that Polaroid.com could be acquired along with its customer information.</li>
<li><span>Legal Protection:</span> It may become necessary for us to release account and other personal information if we believe the release is necessary or required for us to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms and Conditions or other policies or agreements; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of Polaroid.com, our owners, service providers, licensees, users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include our selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing your person information in violation of this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><span>Upon Your Consent:</span> Unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, you will receive notice when personal information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share your personal information.</li>
<li><span>Third Parties Links and Advertisements:</span> Polaroid.com may have third party advertising and links to other websites. We do not share any personally identifiable information about you to these advertisers or third party websites. You should be aware that some of these third party websites and advertisers (or services working at their request) may use technology that sends the advertisements to your browser, and as a result they receive your internet address when this happens. In addition, they may use cookies, tags, beacons, JavaScript or other technologies to measure the performance of advertisements to customize the advertisements. Polaroid.com does not have the right to access or control such practices and such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you contact these third party websites and advertisers directly if you would like more information about their privacy practices. If you prefer that we do not use your personal information to allow third parties to personalize advertisements for you, please adjust your preferences in your account.</li>
