            <p>Thank you for visiting Polk Community College. Your privacy
            is very important to us. Simply stated, our policy is to collect
            no personal information about you when you visit Polk Community
            College's website, unless you affirmatively choose to make such
            information available to us.</p>

            <p>When you visit the PCC website, the Web server automatically
            recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which
            you accessed the site. This information does not result in the
            identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal
            information.</p>

            <p>In addition, information is only gathered regarding the volume
            and timing of access to the site by collecting information on
            the date, time and pages you visited while at the site. In addition,
            we collect aggregate information about web browser software versions
            and technical capabilities such as screen resolution. This is
            done so that the content of the site can be improved. This information
            is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate
            information is collected, and your personal information is not
            identified.</p>

            <p>If you choose to share personal information, such as by subscribing
            to an e-newsletter, sending a message, or filling out an electronic
            form with personal information, the information will only be
            used for the purposes you authorized. Some of this information
            may be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply
            with the state of Florida's archiving policies. However, information
            will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies,
            unless required by state or federal law. If information is required
            by law to be disclosed about you, then every effort to notify
            you about the disclosure in advance will be taken. If you have
            other questions about Polk Community College privacy policies,
            or have suggestions on how these policies can be improved, please
            feel free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@polk.edu">
