<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>This website is owned and operated by eAccess Solutions, Inc. eAccess is responsible for taking your order, shipping it and providing you excellent customer service. For this reason "eAccess Solutions, Inc." will appear on your credit card statement for any purchase that you make on this website. We hope you enjoy your shopping experience with us!<br><br> PolaroidStore.com ("Website") is an 
interactive online service operated by eAccess Solutions, Inc. ("us", "we", or 
"our"). Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy, which 
includes compliance with California Privacy Rights (see also http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov).<br>
<br>
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable 
information you may provide us through our Website. We have adopted this Privacy 
Policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our 
Website, how we use this information and under what circumstances we may 
disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to 
information we collect through our Website and does not apply to our collection 
of information from other sources (unless specifically stated). <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our Website, sets 
forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. 
Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to 
agree to additional terms and conditions. <br>
<br>
We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and you should 
review it frequently, as it may change from time to time without notice. Any 
changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy 
Policy. WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO 
NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, 
IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE. If, at any point, we decide to use your 
personally identifiable information in a manner materially different than what 
was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users of this change by 
e-mail to the last e-mail address provided to us. Users will have a choice (by 
means of an opt-out opportunity) as to whether or not we use their information 
in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
policy under which the information was collected if you opt-out of the new 
policy. <br>
<br>
A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br>
Our Website typically collects two kinds of information about you: (a) 
information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information 
that does not personally identify you, that we automatically collect when you 
visit our Website or that you provide us. <br>
<br>
(1) Personally Identifiable Information: <br>
Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information 
that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, 
mail address, phone number, etc. As a general policy, we do not automatically 
collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our Website. In 
certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an 
opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection 
with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Website. For 
instance, you may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, e-mail address, 
credit card number and phone number when registering with our Website, using our 
online store or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain 
demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage 
frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (c) 
post a product rating and recommendation on our Website. Certain information may 
not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may 
become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). 
Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many 
instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular 
activity, realize a benefit we may offer or gain access to certain content on 
our Website. <br>
<br>
(2) Non-Personal Information: <br>
Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not 
personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain personally 
identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that 
has been rendered anonymous. We obtain non-personal information about you from 
information that you provide us, either separately or together with your 
personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain 
non-personal information from you when you access our Website. <br>
<br>
B. HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED <br>
(1) Personally Identifiable Information: <br>
The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to 
carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you or in other 
ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the 
information. We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety 
of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information for 
our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated 
companies ("affiliated companies"), or to communicate with you about content or 
other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website. You may 
opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated 
companies, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated 
companies, as set forth below.<br>
<br>
We share your information with our site licensor, PLR IP Holdings, LLC and in certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information 
with our third-party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of 
our affiliated companies)  e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, 
deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or 
promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc. 
Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, 
only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally 
identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion 
(e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Website, and with third 
parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted 
or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production companies we may use). 
Further, we may share your personally identifiable information with third 
parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have 
marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our 
Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally 
identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties without 
your prior approval. <br>
<br>
(2) Non-Personal Information: <br>
In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that 
you choose to provide to us on the Website, we and our third-party service 
providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect certain 
web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Website. This 
information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the 
time and the preceding page view, among other information. In addition, your IP 
address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to 
access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to as a "Device 
Identifier") may be collected. A Device Identifier is a number that is 
automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone or other device used to 
access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device 
Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal 
information you provide. The methods that may be used to collect this 
information include the following: <br>
<br>
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web 
beacons, (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs,)" may be included in our web 
pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any 
electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or 
e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used 
for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to 
the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many 
e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular 
articles or links were actually viewed. <br>
<br>
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a computer when it is used to visit 
the Website. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without 
limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the 
Website. You may disable cookies using your browser's preferences, but some 
features of the Website may not function properly or may operate slowly if you 
disable the cookies. If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, 
you may be able to direct your internet browser to notify you and seek approval 
whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie 
manually from your hard drive through your internet browser or other programs. 
Please note, however, that some parts of our Website will not function properly 
or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the 
acceptance of cookies. <br>
<br>
Mobile Device Identifiers. Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify 
mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such 
device information if you access the Website through mobile devices. Certain 
features of our Website may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we 
may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. 
Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint 
the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the 
provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this information.
<br>
<br>
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to 
collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as which 
links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from 
our Web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are 
connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. <br>
Information collected through passive means may be non-identifying or may be 
associated with you. In the latter case it will be treated as personally 
identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<br>
We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze 
site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted 
promotional activities and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal 
information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from 
others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies 
and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that 
aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify 
you. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third 
parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored 
to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally 
identifiable information. <br>
<br>
C. OTHER USES <br>
(1) E-mail Communications: <br>
If you send us an e-mail with questions or comments, we and our site licensor, 
PLR IP Holdings, LLC may use your personally 
identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may 
save your questions or comments for future reference. For security reasons, we 
do not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as 
passwords, social security numbers or bank account information, to us by e-mail. 
Further, we and our site licensor, PLR IP Holdings, LLC may send you e-mail under the following circumstances: (a) if you 
request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves e-mail 
communications; (b) if it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., 
product updates, customer support, etc.); (c) if we are sending you information 
about our other products and services; (d) if you consented to being contacted 
by e-mail for a particular purpose; (e) if you send us an e-mail, post 
information on the Website (i.e., a blog) or otherwise submit information to us 
electronically, we and our site licensor, PLR IP Holdings, LLC may e-mail you to follow-up or otherwise communicate with you 
with respect thereto; (f) to provide you legal notices or notices with respect 
to your use of the Website; or (g) to otherwise facilitate a transaction between 
us. In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your 
preferences for receiving e-mail communications from us; that is, agree to some 
communications but not others. You may "opt out" of receiving future commercial 
e-mail communications from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" link included at the 
bottom of most e-mails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we 
reserve the right to send you transactional e-mails such as customer service 
communications. <br>
<br>
(2) Transfer of Assets: <br>
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If 
another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the 
personally identifiable information and non-personal information we have about 
you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will 
take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed. Also, if any 
bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such 
information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or 
transferred to third parties. <br>
<br>
(3) Other: <br>
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to 
disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we 
are required to do so by law, with respect to notices and counternotices 
pursuant to our DMCA notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we 
believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) 
conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend 
our legal rights or property, our Website, or other users; or (d) in an 
emergency to protect the health and safety of our Websites users or the general 
public. <br>
<br>
(4) Sweepstakes Contests and Promotions: <br>
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Website 
that may require registration. By entering any promotion, you are agreeing to 
the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific 
requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the 
sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in 
advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. If you choose to enter a 
sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, personally identifiable information may 
be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the 
administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection 
with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by 
the promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list. <br>
<br>
(5) Your California Privacy Rights: <br>
Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California 
Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in 
California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed 
certain personally identifiable information as defined under California law 
during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes. You are 
limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the 
fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address 
for our response. You may request the information in writing at: <br>
eAccess Solutions, Inc.<br>
407 North Quentin Road<br>
Palatine, IL 60067-4832<br>
Attn: California Privacy Request<br>
<br>
(6) Third Party Ad Server Networks: <br>
The Website may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve 
advertisements on the Website and may use traffic measurement services to 
analyze traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties that 
display advertisements based on your visits to the Website and other websites 
you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to 
you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Website's 
third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic 
measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your 
computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser and track certain 
behavioral information regarding users of your computer via a Device Identifier. 
These third party cookies are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver 
advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from 
seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness 
to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Note that any 
images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association 
with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to 
carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web 
beacons are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this 
one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the 
Website, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, 
which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising 
Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information 
used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. <br>
<br>
D. PUBLIC FORUMS <br>
We may offer chat rooms, interactive blogs, message boards, bulletin boards or 
similar public forums where you and other users of our Website can communicate. 
The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide 
information (including personal information) in connection with your use of 
these public forums. We may use personally identifiable and non-personal 
information about you to identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any 
information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or 
collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy 
Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any 
information you choose to publicly post or share through our Website. <br>
<br>
E. CHILDREN <br>
The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Website requiring 
personally identifiable information are not intended for children. We do not 
knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the 
age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 and 
believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us please 
contact us at Sales@PolaroidStore.com. A parent or guardian of a child under 
the age of 18 may review and request deletion of such childs personally 
identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof. <br>
<br>
F. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE <br>
We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to 
protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our 
control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your 
personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant 
the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are 
not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your 
personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that your 
"personally identifiable information" (as the term or similar terms are defined 
by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, 
we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last 
e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under 
the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we 
take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore
