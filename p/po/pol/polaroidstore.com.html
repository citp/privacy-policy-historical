<h3>Information We Collect and How We Use It </h3>

<h4>Information You Explicitly Provide </h4>
<p>In order to establish your account or to place any orders for prints or other products provided through the Services, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information to us, such as your name, mailing and email address, phone number, and a credit card number and expiration date. We will use that information to process and communicate with you concerning any order you may submit, and to enable our providing online imaging services to you. At times, we may also ask you for similar information, or information about your photography equipment and practices, if you choose to request a newsletter, enter a contest, fill out a customer survey or participate in a program. We may use this information to make improvements to our service or customize your service experience. In addition, all information will be shared between us and Polaroid Corporation, and Polaroid Corporation is required to adhere to this Privacy Policy and may only use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Other than Polaroid Corporation (PLR IP Holdings, LLC), we will not share your personally identifiable information with anyone, including other third parties without giving you the opportunity to opt-out, except as expressly described in the "Third Party Service Providers" section of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>We use aggregate non-personal information (i.e. information that does not include personally identifiable data) for statistical analysis of user behavior, product development, content improvement and marketing, promotional and advertising purposes. We may also make that aggregate non-personal information available to select third party partners. </p>

<h4>Information We Automatically Collect </h4>

<i>Cookies and Invisible Gifs (also known as "Clear Gifs," "Web Bugs" and "Tracker Gifs") </i>
<p>Generally speaking, we use cookies and invisible gifs to track users of the Services and Sites and Apps, including photo albums and the shopping areas. For example, when you visit our Sites or Apps, we assign you a unique User ID and store it on your computer in the form of a cookie (unless your browser's cookie support has been disabled). Through the use of cookies, User IDs, and invisible gifs, we are able to optimize the performance and functionality of our Sites and Apps, and to personalize our Sites and Apps for you and present you with content and offers specific to your interests. </p>

<i>Disabling Cookies </i>
<p>If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your information being stored in cookies, we recommend disabling cookie support in your web browser, though please understand this will limit the performance and functionality of the Sites and Apps. Your browser documentation will provide specific procedures for disabling cookie support.</p>

<h4>Affiliate Site ID </h4>
<p>If you entered the Sites and Apps by clicking a link or promotion on another website (including another co-branded partner website), or if you used a site that provides universal registration services to sign up for our Site or App, we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. We may also use this information in conjunction with your activities on our Sites and Apps to help us identify what offers and services may be of interest to you. </p>

<h4>Third Party Service Providers </h4>
<p>We may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that assist us in providing the Services to you including the Service Provider. Following are some examples of our use of third party service providers: We may share your credit card information with a financial institution to affect your purchase of our products using your credit card. We may share personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) with third parties that assist us with the administration of our newsletters or contests or that help us understand what our customers want and need from our service, including analysis of the results of particular surveys we may perform. We also engage third parties to assist us by tracking the number of visitors to our Sites and Apps, including visitors that have "clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party web sites and those visitors' activities on the Sites and Apps. We may also choose to offer certain third party products, such as Custom Printed Cards through the Services and may disclose certain portions of your personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) to allow those product producers to fulfill your product order. </p>

<h4>Contact Us via Email Form </h4>
<p>If you use our Contact Us via <a href="https://www.polaroidstore.com/Help/SendComments.aspx">Email Form</a>, we do ask for your email address and name. In addition, we do collect what browser and operating system you are running so our support staff may properly assist you. </p>

<h3>Opting-Out, Updates and Security </h3>

<h4>Choice/Opt-Out </h4>
<p>The Services provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving emails and other promotional communications from Polaroid Store. To discontinue your receipt of such communications, please select the opt-out feature of any promotional email that you receive. Polaroid Store will continue to send you non-promotional, service emails concerning orders you have placed, concerning the maintenance of your account, and concerning the expiration of albums or images within your account. </p>

<h4>Correct/Update </h4>
<p>If you want to review or change any information you previously provided to us, please go to the "My Account" section of the Sites and Apps. </p>

<h4>De-Activating Your Polaroid Store Online Imaging Account </h4>
<p>If you want to de-activate your account with Polaroid Store, please send an email to (contactus@polaroidstore.com) with your request. Please be sure to include the email address of the account you wish to de-activate. Your account will be de-activated and you will no longer receive communications from us; however, we will keep your account information in our database for record-keeping purposes only. </p>

<h4>Security</h4> 
<p>The Services have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, access to that data is limited to authorized Polaroid Store and Service Provider staff members and our hosting company only and is further restricted by password protection mechanisms. By default, all orders placed on our Sites and Apps are done on a secure server that encrypts all financial information through SSL. We will not store your credit card information in our database unless you explicitly instruct us to do so. </p>
