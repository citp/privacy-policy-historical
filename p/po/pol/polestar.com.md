"Cookies"  
  
When you view this website, or any other website linked from this website, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a “cookie”. This information allows us to measure website activity to tailor information to suit your individual preferences. Cookies may tell us the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at on our websites, and the website that referred you to our website. The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful visit.

  
A cookie is a small text file which the website you are visiting saves on your computer. Cookies are used by many websites to give visitors access to various functions. The information contained in the cookie can be used to monitor a user’s surfing behaviour. There are two types of cookies. One kind of cookie saves a file for an extended period on your computer and is used, for example, with functions which describe what information is new since you last visited the particular site. The second kind of cookie, also called “session cookie” is stored temporarily in your computer’s memory during the time you visit a website. The session cookie is for example used to keep track of which language you have chosen on the website. Session cookies are not stored for a long time and disappear when you close your browser. Polestar uses cookies e.g. to record visitor statistics.
