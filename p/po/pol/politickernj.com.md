  * Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.
  * Cookie data. When you visit the PoliticsNJ.com Web site, PoliticsNJ.com or one of our affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"â€”small files containing a string of charactersâ€”to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with PoliticsNJ.com, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.
  * Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable the Observer Media Group, LLC to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the PoliticsNJ.com site.



Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the PoliticsNJ.com Web site.

  1. To improve the content and design of the PoliticsNJ.com Web site.
  2. To enable audit bureaus and third party advertisers to verify our claims of traffic to the site.
  3. To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.

  * If you have previously registered with another Observer Media Group affiliate and you begin to fill out certain forms on the PoliticsNJ.com Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your PoliticsNJ.com user record.
  * If you have provided information to PoliticsNJ.com or any site owned by the Observer Media Group, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.
