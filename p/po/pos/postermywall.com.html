250 Mils uses cookies on the 250 Mils Website. A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow the website to store information which uniquely identifies our users. 250 Mils Website‚s cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases. You can always reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent.

<h3>How do we secure your information?</h3>

<p> 
When you place orders or access your account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you.

You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select.
</p>

<p> 
We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with us, you agree to this privacy policy and you consent to the transfer of all information you provide to the United States.

Generally, 250 Mils does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except that:

In such cases, we require that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our privacy policy.
