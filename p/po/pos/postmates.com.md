# Privacy Policy - Postmates

### Last Updated: August 18, 2016

At Postmates, your privacy is important to us. In this privacy policy, we tell you what information we collect, share with others, and how we use it to facilitate deliveries by couriers to customers.

## Scope of this Privacy Policy

Postmates (“Postmates,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) values the privacy of individuals who use our website and mobile apps (collectively, our “Platform”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information from Postmates’ users (“Users”). It applies to our customers (“Customers”), individuals who deliver products requested by Customers through our Platform (“Couriers”), anyone who signs up to become a Courier (“Prospective Couriers”), businesses selling products through our Platform (“Merchants”), and other partners who use our Platform to facilitate delivery of products (“Partners”). By using the Platform, you agree to the Privacy Policy and any future amendments and additions. Your use of our Platform is also subject to our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms).

## 1\. Information You Provide to Us

#### 1.1. Information Provided by Customers

  * Registration and Profile Information. When you sign up for Postmates as a Customer, you provide your name, email address, physical address, and phone number. If you sign up using your Facebook account, we receive your name and email address. After registration, Customers can add multiple delivery addresses to their profile.
  * Payment Information. When you add a payment card to your Postmates account, a third-party payments service provider receives your card information. To help keep your financial data secure, we never store full payment card information on our servers.



#### 1.2. Information Provided by Prospective and Active Couriers

  * Sign Up Information. When you sign up to become a Courier, you provide your name, Social Security Number, date of birth, email address, physical address, phone number, photo, driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information. We share this information with third-party providers who initiate background check reports on you. Additional information about the third parties who run the background checks is provided in Section 3.2 below.
  * Payment Information. We receive Couriers’ bank account and tax information to provide payment and for tax reporting purposes.



#### 1.3. Information Provided by Merchants and Partners

  * Profile Information. A Merchant who signs up for our Platform provides us with the business’s physical address, hours, and product information. We also collect product information from Partners.
  * Payment Information. We may receive Merchants’ bank account information to provide payment.



#### 1.4. Information Provided by All Users

  * Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you contact our Customer Support team, we will receive your name, email address, and the contents of any message or attachments that you may send to us, as well as any other information you choose to provide.



## 2\. Information We Collect

#### 2.1. Information We Collect From Your Device With Your Permission

  * Location Information When Using the App. In order to facilitate on-demand deliveries, we need to know where Customers and Couriers are located. We receive a Customer’s location information when you open the Postmates app as well as when you place an order, to help determine the appropriate delivery address. We continuously collect location information from Couriers who are “on duty,” in order to assist Couriers in finding available deliveries, allow Customers to track deliveries, and other similar purposes. We also use location information for analytics purposes.



#### 2.2. Information We Collect When You Use Our Platform

  * Device Information. We receive information from Users’ devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, unique device identifiers, and, if you register with your Facebook account, your Facebook identifier.
  * Usage Information. We automatically receive information about your interactions with our Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, the products you search for or purchase, and the dates and times of your visits, to help us understand how you use our Platform, help us improve our Platform, and provide you information about our Platform, our Merchants, and our Partners.
  * Call and Text Information. We work with one or more third parties to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Customers and Couriers who are delivering the Customers’ products. We receive information about these communications including the date and time of the call or text message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the text messages. We do not record or have access to the content of the phone calls.
  * User Feedback. Customers and Couriers can rate and review each other at the end of every delivery. Customers are able to see a Courier’s aggregate ratings during a delivery. After a delivery, we may share feedback or comments that Customers provide with Couriers, but we will not identify the Customer. We may also share with Couriers their aggregate ratings.
  * Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies. We and our service providers collect information through the use of “cookies” and similar technologies to understand how you navigate through and interact with our Platform, to learn what content is popular, for authentication and advertising purposes, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use our Platform. We also use cookies for data analytics purposes, including from Google Analytics.

## 5\. How Postmates Shares Information It Collects From Users

#### 5.1. Sharing between Customers and Couriers

Once a Courier accepts a delivery request from a Customer, the Customer can see the Courier’s first name and last initial and the Courier can see whatever name the Customer provided when signing up. A Customer is also able to see a Courier’s photo. During a delivery, the Customer in some instances is able to see the Courier’s real-time location, and the Courier is able to see the Customer’s delivery address. During a delivery, Customers and Couriers are able to call and text each other. Customer and Courier phone numbers are masked and, only in rare instances, may they be able to see the other’s phone number. As described above, Customers are able to see a Courier’s aggregate ratings during a delivery. After a delivery, we may share feedback or comments that a Customer provides with a Courier, but we will not identify the Customer. We may also share with Couriers their aggregate ratings.

#### 5.2. Service Providers

We share your information with service providers that perform services on our behalf, including all of the uses described in Section 4 above.
