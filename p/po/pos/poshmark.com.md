# Privacy Policy - Poshmark

**_PRIVACY POLICY_**  


This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 24, 2014.   


**_Our Policy_ :**

Welcome to the service provided by Poshmark, Inc. ("Poshmark", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This privacy policy has been created to provide information about our company, our website and the services we provide (including through our mobile applications) (collectively, the "Services") to our users ("you" and/or "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Poshmark's policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data"), that is collected from users of the Services.   


**_Information We Collect_ :**

When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

**Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:** We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to our Services and/or third party services (for example, username and email address provided by services such as Facebook Connect), provide us with credit card and other payment information, use certain Services including withdrawal of funds, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Poshmark collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. 

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Poshmark and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.**

**Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data _:_** When you interact with Poshmark through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Poshmark may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Poshmark affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the number of transactions that are effected through the Service, the number of messages you send and receive, the total number of users of our Services, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Poshmark may conduct research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Poshmark may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Poshmark may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.   


In operating the Services (and in particular in making our website available), we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services features.   


We may also employ the use of anonymous identifiers, which are random strings of characters that are used for the same purposes as cookies on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available.  


We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Services. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain personally non-identifiable information and monitor user activity on the Services, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.  


We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Poshmark account.  


**Do Not Track Signals:** We may (and we may allow third party service providers to) use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Service. Our Service currently does not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.  


**_Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information_ :**

Poshmark uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email or other messaging means, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem, or if you confirm a transaction using the Services, we will use the financial data you provide to consummate the transaction. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Poshmark and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us customize the Services, improve the content and functionality of the Services, better understand our users, prevent fraud and improve the Services. Poshmark and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, any marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. 

Please also note that to the extent you include any Personal Data or other information in a listing or any other content that you upload to the Service, we have the right to publish that listing and other content (including without limitation any Personal Data or other information including in the listing) in connection with the operation of the Service or any other products or services of Poshmark, or the promotion, advertising or marketing thereof (including publishing that listing and other content on the Internet or on Third Party Services such as Facebook, sharing it with blogs, etc.). In addition, users have the ability as part of the Service to share your listings with others.

If Poshmark intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.   


**_Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information_ :**

Poshmark is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: 

**Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. 

**Related Companies:** We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

**Agents, Service Providers, Consultants and Related Third Parties:** Poshmark, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include maintaining databases, identity verification, fraud monitoring, processing credit card payments etc. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function (for example, providing our credit card payment provider with your credit card information).

**Legal Requirements:** Poshmark may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Poshmark, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. 

**Enforcement:**

Poshmark may disclose your Personal Data to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, the Poshmark Terms of Service, or our other policies posted on the Site from time to time or agreements to which you are a party.   


**_Your Choices_ :**

If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services. In addition, you may request that we delete your account, and any information associated with your account, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to retain this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete your information, it will be deleted from the active database but may remain in our archives.   


**_Exclusions_ :**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Poshmark other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Poshmark through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as forums (collectively, "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Poshmark shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.   


**_Children_ :**

Poshmark does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Poshmark through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. 

**_Links to Other Web Sites_ :**

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Poshmark (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Poshmark endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies. 

**_Integrating Third Party Services within the Services_** : 

One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party services, such as Facebook and other social media and networking services, payment service providers etc. ("Third Party Services"), to be directly integrated into your Poshmark experience. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to provide us your username and password for the relevant Third Party Services. By enabling such Third Party Services, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these service providers for this purpose. When you add a Third Party Service account to the Service, we will collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service. As part of such integration, such Third Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Third Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and Poshmark shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that may be enabled within the Service. 

**_Security_** **:**

Poshmark takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. 

**_Other Terms and Conditions_ :**

Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Poshmark Terms of Service located at [http://www.poshmark.com/terms](https://web.archive.org/terms).

The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Poshmark to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Poshmark reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
