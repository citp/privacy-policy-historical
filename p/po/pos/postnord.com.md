A high level of security for your personal data is of utmost importance to PostNord, and we have in place appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, modification, dissemination or destruction.

PostNord’s duty of confidentiality as set forth in the Swedish Postal Services Act, applies to mail, but other information about PostNord’s customers is also treated confidentially. Address information in our directory for mail delivery may in some instances be handed over to authorities based on an obligation in law or other regulation.

**7\. Limitations in the transfer of personal data**

PostNord may engage external partners and suppliers to perform services on behalf of PostNord, e.g. to provide IT services, payment services or to assist in marketing, analysis or statistics. The performance of these services may entail such parties, both within and outside of the EU/EEA, obtaining access to your personal data.

Companies which are processing personal data on behalf of PostNord are obliged to sign an agreement with PostNord in order to ensure a high level of protection for your personal data. For partners located outside the EU/EEA, additional protective measures are undertaken, e.g. the signing of an agreement which includes the European Commission’s model clauses for data transfers, which can be found on the European Commission’s website.
