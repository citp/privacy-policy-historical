    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>This privacy policy is intended to inform you, the Postloop user, of Postloop's information
        management practices including the types of information gathered, how this information is
        used and safeguarded, and the degree to which you may control the maintenance and sharing
        of your information.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Prior to joining Postloop, you will be required to provide your email address. This is only
        visible to Postloop management and is not available or provided to any third parties or solicitors
        under any circumstances. You may periodically receive email communication from Postloop management,
        which you are able to opt out of. Postloop will also track and record the IP Address
        of all visitors to postloop.com for security purposes. This, too, will never be available or provided to any
        third parties or solicitors.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Prior to listing your forum at Postloop, you will be required to provide the following information on
        your forum: Forum name, URL, description, and software version. All of this information will be
        visible and available for public use, without limitation. When another Postloop user joins your 
        forum, Postloop will request their username and email address. The username will be saved by Postloop
        but the email address will not. Postloop requests the email address to verify ownership of the
        account. Postloop.com will take that username and email address and retrieve the corresponding user id 
        from your forums. The username and id are later used to track the
        number of posts submitted to your forums. Username, User ID, and Post Count are the only pieces of information
        that are extracted from your forums via the Postloop tracking service. This information will be collected
        and stored in the Postloop database but will not be accessible by anybody other than yourself and Postloop
        staff. This information will never be available or provided to any third parties or solicitors.
        No personally identifiable information will be collected by Postloop from your forums.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Prior to requesting payment via PayPal, you will be asked to provide your Name, Address, and Phone Number.
    This information is not available to the public and is used by Postloop management for its own accounting. This
    personally identifiable information is not be provided to any third parties or solicitors.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When buying or selling points via Postloop, your PayPal email address, transaction amount, and transaction ID
    will be collected and stored by Postloop for historical reasons. This information is visible by Postloop
    management alone and is not available or provided to any third parties or solicitors
        under any circumstances.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Any information labeled as available to the public can be collected, correlated, and used by
        third parties, and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.
        Such activities are beyond the control of Postloop and are not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All personally identifiable information can be removed from public view at the request of the owner, however
    this information will remain in the Postloop data repository for purposes of ongoing operation. Only at the discretion
    of Postloop management or at the request from the proper authorities will data be removed from the Postloop
    data repository.</p>
