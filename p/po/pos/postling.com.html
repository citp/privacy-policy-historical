<b>PRIVACY POLICY</b>
<p>This Privacy Policy will advise you about LocalVox Media Inc.'s ("LocalVox") guidelines concerning the use of your personal information, including the efforts we make to protect your personal information in accordance with these guidelines.  The current version of the Privacy Policy, along with the current version of the Terms of Service, form the "Agreement" between you and LocalVox.</p>
<p>Please refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly.  This policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our users' needs.</p>
<b>What Information Do We Collect?</b>
<p>When you visit this Website you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Website use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse the Website.</p>
<p>Personal Information You Choose to Provide.  If you choose to correspond with us through email, or interact with us via the Website or otherwise, we may retain, use and share the content of your email messages and other information, together with your name, email address and other personal and identifying information, and our responses.</p>
<p>Website Use Information.  Like other commercial web sites, our Website utilizes technologies called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?"), web server log files, session monitoring, and other technologies to collect information about how our Website is used. Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, activities performed on our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Website.</p>
<b>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</b>
<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information in our business activities, including providing the services you requested, monitoring the use of our services, and improving our content, service offerings, and layout.</p>
<p>As part of our business activities, we may use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided below.</p>
<b>What Are Cookies?</b>
<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes a unique identifier. When you visit a website, that website's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies that website has previously sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our Website will not function as effectively when viewed by other users who permit cookies. As far as we know, a cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</p>
<b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</b>
<p>As you visit and browse our Website, the Website uses cookies to differentiate you from other users of the Website. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Website and which parts of the Website are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Website and better serve our users. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p>
<b>IP Addresses</b>
<p>Internet protocol ("IP") addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>
<b>Sharing and Selling Information</b>
<p>We may share, sell, lend or lease the information that we collect from our users with third parties.</p>
<b>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</b>
<p>We may disclose any information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is appropriate or helpful to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the public.</p>
<b>What About Other Websites Linked to Our Website?</b>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites other than our Website, including without limitation any website linked to or from our Website or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Website.</p>
<p>Please remember that whether or not you use a link to go from our Website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect on any other website. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our Website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over the rules and policies of each web site before conducting any transactions with them.</p>
<b>Your Consent</b>
<p>By using our Website you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> 
<b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b>
<p>Please note that we generally store and process your personal information on computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less or more stringent than the laws of other countries or jurisdictions. We have put in place a number of physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online, but no system is completely secure.</p>
<b>Information from Children</b>
<p>We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from any individuals under the age of 13, nor do we provide any of our products or services to individuals under 13 without written permission from a parent or guardian.  If you believe that we have inadvertently collected any such information, or provided any such products or services, please contact us immediately so that we may delete the information.</p>
<b>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</b>
<p>In the event that our Website (or any portion of our Website or other assets) is acquired, spun out or merged with another entity, your information would be considered part of the assets, and may be part of the assets that are transferred.</p>
<b>Policy Modifications</b>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, with or without notice. If changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we may email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.</p>
<p>We may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes to our Website. We will post those changes here so that you will always know our current policies regarding what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether and how we will disclose that information to others. .</p>
<p>The current version of the Privacy Policy will discuss, address and control LocalVox's privacy practices.  All changes to the Privacy Policy are prospective, which means should a question or dispute arise regarding the Privacy Policy or LocalVox's privacy practices, the version of the Privacy Policy that controls is the version of the Privacy Policy that was current as of the date that the actions or omissions giving rise to the question or dispute occurred.</p>
