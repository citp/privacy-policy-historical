| Postini Privacy Statement  
  
  
[](https://www.truste.org/validate/7061)Postini is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe's certification covers this website's gathering and dissemination of information not any services or products. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the webmaster by via email (webmaster@postini.com).

We are committed to honoring the privacy of our users and visitors. By publishing our Privacy Statement, we allow users to make informed consent to participate in our service offerings. 

**Personal Information**  
Postini does not require its users to provide personal contact or demographic information. We obtain pertinent information about your email account through our partnership with your existing email service provider. You can deactivate your services at any time by turning your application settings to the OFF position. Once you do so, new services will not be added to your account. 

Postini never sells or makes available individual names, lists of users, or aggregate data to any third parties for gain. We will not accept customer or end-user information that your email provider may have collected. 

"Postini's web tracking software is used to analyze traffic to this website. Postini does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services, our software does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. Postini only collects aggregate data. For more information about our vendor's privacy policy, please click [here](http://www.webtrendslive.com/wtl_system/privacy_policy.htm)." 

**Passwords and Message Content**  
Passwords are never released to any party other than authorized personnel of your email service provider, except as required for law enforcement purposes. 

User configurations and email messages are processed automatically by software, so humans do not review this information. User configuration information provided to Postini is used explicitly to deliver services that match your requirements and not for any other purpose. All user-specific information and email message information—including content, addresses, categorizations, and IP addresses—is kept strictly confidential. Postini delivers only services that comply with the existing service agreement between you and your email service provider. 

**Email Communications**  
Postini will notify users via email when viruses are quarantined in the Message Center. Reminders of your quarantined junk email are also emailed on a regular schedule that is determined by your email provider. 

**Volunteered Information**  
Postini allows website visitors to contact us directly with questions or comments. The information collected via email is used only to reply to questions, comments, or requests. 

We try to read and reply to every message. Sometimes we file your comments, so that we can improve the site and program in the future. A small sample of users who contact us may be invited to participate in usability studies. Personal information collected during these studies is never shared with outside parties. 

**Newsletters**  
Email addresses provided when opting in to the Postini newsletter are used  
exclusively for delivery of the newsletter. To remove an email address from  
the list, enter the email address and submit the form at

**Cookie Usage**  
Postini uses cookies to sometimes store your user name, password, and application settings to ease site navigation processes. Depending upon your email provider, they can also be used to assist with password authentication purposes. Cookies do NOT hold any personal information. Postini uses Webtrends to track visitors.

**Linked Sites**  
This website contains links to other sites. Postini is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Postini websites. 

**Framed Environments**  
In occurrences where email providers display the Message Center in a "framed" environment, Postini cannot guarantee the privacy practices of that customer. In order for users to update their service information users will need to contact their existing email service provider. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website. 

[**Security Statement**](https://web.archive.org/company/security.html)  
Postini sets strict security policies and access rights to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of messages stored on our servers. To learn more, check out the Postini full security statement. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users.
