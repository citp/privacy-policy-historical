    <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>PRIVACY POLICY</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">This Privacy
Policy was last updated on July 24, 2014.</font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Our Policy</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Welcome to
the service provided by Poshmark, Inc. ("Poshmark", "we", "us"
and/or "our"). This privacy policy has been created to provide information
about our company, our website and the services we provide (including
through our mobile applications) (collectively, the "Services")
to our users ("you" and/or "your"). This Privacy Policy sets
forth Poshmark's policy with respect to information, including personally
identifiable data ("Personal Data"), that is collected from users
of the Services.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Information
We Collect</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">When you interact
with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other
information from you, as further described below:</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Personal
Data That You Provide Through the Services: </b>
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
information, such as when you register for access to our Services and/or
third party services (for example, username and email address provided
by services such as Facebook Connect), provide us with credit card and
other payment information, use certain Services including withdrawal of
funds, contact us with inquiries
or respond to one of our surveys.  Wherever Poshmark collects Personal
Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>By voluntarily
providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it
in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data,
you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred
from your current location to the offices and servers of Poshmark and
the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United
States. </b></font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Non-Identifiable
or Aggregated Data<i>: </i></b>When you interact with Poshmark through
the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable
information. Such information, which is collected passively using various
technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
Poshmark may store such information itself or such information may be
included in databases owned and maintained by Poshmark affiliates, agents
or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool
it with other information to track, for example, the number of transactions
that are effected through the Service, the number of messages you send
and receive, the total number of users of our Services, the domain
names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users
use and interact with the Services.  Also, in an ongoing effort
to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Poshmark may
conduct research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior
based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This
research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis.  Poshmark
may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates,
agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and
aggregate information does not identify you personally.  Poshmark
may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
services to current and prospective business partners, and to other
third parties for other lawful purposes.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In
operating the Services (and in particular in making our website available),
we may also use a technology called "cookies."  A cookie
is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services
gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help
provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze
Services usage more accurately.  For instance, our Services may
set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services
without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once
during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies,
we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most
web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar.
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification
when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you
to take advantage of some of the Services features.</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
  We may also employ the use of anonymous identifiers, which are random
  strings of characters that are used for the same purposes as cookies
  on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology
  is not available.</font><br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
  We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Services. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain personally non-identifiable information and monitor user activity on the Services, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</font><br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
  We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Poshmark account.</font><br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
  <b>Do Not Track Signals:</b> We may (and we may allow third party service
  providers to) use cookies or similar technologies to collect information
  about your browsing activities over time and across different websites
  following your use of the Service.  Our Service currently does not respond
  to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy
  Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future,
  we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.</font><br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Our Use
of Your Personal Data and Other Information</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Poshmark uses
the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this
Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we
may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it
was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email or other messaging
means, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question
or resolve your problem, or if you confirm a transaction using the Services,
we will use the financial data you provide to consummate the transaction.
Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the
Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access
to such services and to monitor your use of such services.  Poshmark
and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may
also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information
collected through the Services to help us customize the Services, improve
the content and functionality of the Services, better understand our
users, prevent fraud and improve the Services. Poshmark and its Related Companies may
use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services
or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.
If we do so, any marketing communication we send you will contain instructions
permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing
communications.  In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive
any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted
from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some
administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service,
such as billing or service notifications. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Please also
note that to the extent you include any Personal Data or other information
in a listing or any other content that you upload to the Service, we
have the right to publish that listing and other content (including
without limitation any Personal Data or other information including
in the listing) in connection with the operation of the Service or any
other products or services of Poshmark, or the promotion, advertising
or marketing thereof (including publishing that listing and other content
on the Internet or on Third Party Services such as Facebook, sharing
it with blogs, etc.).  In addition, users have the ability as part
of the Service to share your listings with others.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If Poshmark
intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent
with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use
prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Our Disclosure
of Your Personal Data and Other Information</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Poshmark is
not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information
to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however,
certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with
certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Business
Transfers:</b> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses
or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization,
dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred
assets.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Related
Companies: </b>We may also share your Personal Data with our Related
Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Agents,
Service Providers, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</b> Poshmark,
like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain
business-related functions. Examples of such functions include maintaining
databases, identity verification, fraud monitoring,
processing credit card payments etc. When we employ another
company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with
the information that they need to perform their specific function (for
example, providing our credit card payment provider with your credit
card information).</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Legal
Requirements: </b>Poshmark may disclose your Personal Data if required
to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights
or property of Poshmark, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect
the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv)
protect against legal liability. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Enforcement:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Poshmark may
disclose your Personal Data to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy,
the Poshmark Terms of Service, or our other policies posted on the Site
from time to time or agreements to which you are a party.
</font><br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Your
Choices</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If you choose
not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain
Services.  In addition, you may request that we delete your account,
and any information associated with your account, but please note that
we may be required (by law or otherwise) to retain this information
and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in
which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have
fulfilled such requirements). When we delete your information, it will
be deleted from the active database but may remain in our archives.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Exclusions</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">This Privacy
Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Poshmark other
than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy
shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Poshmark
through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but
is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services,
such as forums (collectively, "Public Areas"), any ideas for new
products or modifications to existing products and other unsolicited
submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited
Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Poshmark shall
be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited
Information without limitation or attribution.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Children</u>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Poshmark does
not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13.
If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data
through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy
by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through
the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe
that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Poshmark
through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete
that information from our databases. </font></p>
<h1><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Links to Other Web Sites</u>:<u>  </u></b></font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">This Privacy
Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links
to other web sites not operated or controlled by Poshmark (the "Third
Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not
apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply
that Poshmark endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest
contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Integrating
Third Party Services within the Services</u></b>: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">One of the
special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable various
online third party services, such as Facebook and other social media
and networking services, payment service providers etc.
  ("Third Party Services"), to be directly
integrated into your Poshmark experience. To take advantage of this
feature, we will ask you to provide us your username and password for
the relevant Third Party Services. By enabling such Third Party Services,
you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these service
providers for this purpose. When you add a Third Party Service account
to the Service, we will collect your login information and other relevant
information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third Party
Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service.
As part of such integration, such Third Party Services will provide
us with access to certain information that you have provided to such
Third Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information
in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  However, please remember
that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose
your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties,
and Poshmark shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy
practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that may be enabled
within the Service. </font></p>
<h1 align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Security</b></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>:</b></font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Poshmark takes
reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services
from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic transmission
is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care
in deciding what information you send to us in this way. </font></p>
<h1 align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Other
Terms and Conditions</u>:</b></font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Your access
to and use of the Services is subject to the Poshmark Terms of Service

to Poshmark's Privacy Policy</u>:</b></font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Services
and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times
it may be necessary for Poshmark to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
Poshmark reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy
at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review
this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal
Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above.
Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to
this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of
such revised Privacy Policy. </font></p>
