# Poster Revolution Privacy Policy

### Thank you for shopping at Poster Revolution!

This privacy statement was last revised on **March 22, 2010**. To contact us, please go to "How To Contact Us" below.

### Who We Are

PosterRevolution℠ is a website for purchasing posters, calendars, frames, postcards, and other items. When we talk about the PosterRevolution℠ software and website in this policy, we will use the term "our Services." 

### What This Document Is

This document is our Privacy Statement. It documents the information we collect from users of our Services, how we use that information, who we share it with, how you can access or change your information, how you can contact us, and other important information about how we safeguard our users’ privacy. Importantly, this statement is a part of our "Terms of Service," which is the contract that governs our relationship with you, as a user of our Services. PLEASE NOTE: There are very important terms and conditions governing our relationship that are found in our "terms of service," that are not repeated here in our Privacy Statement because they do not relate to data collection or privacy. To see the terms and conditions that go to <http://www.posterrevolution.com/content/termsofuse.cfm>

### Our Commitment to Privacy

We take privacy seriously. We are committed to establishing and maintaining policies and procedures which protect the privacy of personal information gathered from users of our Services.

### The Information We Collect

A User of our Services is a person who has purchased items via PosterRevolution℠. All other people who use our Services are Visitors.

We collect certain Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from PosterRevolution℠ users, such as your full name, address, credit card number, and email address that you voluntarily submit in order to become a User. 

We may also collect other non-PII from both Users and Visitors, such as IP addresses, aggregate usage data, and the type of browser you use to access our Services. 

### The Technologies We Use

Our Services use "cookies" and "log files" to allow you to sign into our services, and to customize your user experience.

A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. The information in the cookie can be read by other web servers within the same domain. A cookie cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses on your computer. 

A "log file" is a file we maintain on our server, that lists technical information about visitors to our site. It is in the log file that we store the technical information we described above, such as IP address, browser type, language, and referring web page.

### The Way We Use Information

We never use or share the personal information you provide to us online other than as described below without first giving you a chance to opt out or otherwise prohibit such uses. We do not supplement personally identifiable information with information from any other sources.

We use the personal information you provide to us online:  

  * To ensure our Services are relevant to your needs by evaluating the effectiveness of our products and services;
  * To deliver services, such as newsletters that you request or purchase;
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from us;
  * To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate; and
  * To send important status and service messages regarding our Services.



For any of the uses of your information that we describe above, you may opt out, and forbid our use of the information for that purpose, by calling, mailing, or emailing us. To find our contact information, please see the "Contact Us" section at the end of this statement. The only use a user cannot opt out of is updates, which are important notices about the status of the website or potentially the terms of use and privacy policy.

### Sharing of Your Information

In general, we do not share Members PII or non-PII with third parties. However, we may share your PII with third-parties who help us manage or provide our services. We may also share your information with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging, and prize fulfillment of contests we may run.

We may also share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. However, this information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual user or visitor. 

### Disclosure Requirements

Any personal information you submit to us may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. Additionally, we may access or disclose your personal information if we believe it is necessary to: (a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our legal rights or our property, including enforcement of any agreements; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our clients, employees, partners, or members of the public.

### Links to Third Party Sites

PosterRevolution℠ may feature links to third party website and advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our Services.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

Our Services have security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data under our control. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that your information is safe, secure, and available only to you, and our payment process uses SSL.

### Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy

We believe that protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Therefore we do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children under the age of 18, and no part of our Services or software is structured to attract anyone under 18. If you are a parent, and believe that we have stored personal identification about your child under the age of 18, please contact us, and we will immediately investigate and delete any personal information we may have stored about that child.

### Opt-Out Policy

We offer our visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering our products, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply email or write us. You can find our contact information in the "Contact Us" section at the end of this statement.

From time to time we send promotional materials or newsletters by email, as described above in "The Way We Use Information." Any email you receive from us will include our postal address and an "unsubscribe" link that you can use to prohibit us from sending any additional information.

### Changes to This Statement

We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the "last revised" date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement, or material changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing them and giving you the option to opt-out of the new policy or procedures, or by sending you notification of the changes directly. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to stay informed about how PosterRevolution℠ collects and uses your personal information.
