	<div class="content text" aria-labelledby="1465395043779">
			<h3>Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies</h3>

<p>We may receive personal information about you from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.</p>

<p>When you order any product or subscribe for any service we or our partner companies may check your records at credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.</p>

<p>When credit reference agencies receive a search request, they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other organisations (whether or not your application proceeds). Credit reference agencies supply to us or our partner companies both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.</p>

<p>If you are making a joint application or tell us you have a spouse or financial associate we may link your records together so you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose personal information about them. Credit reference agencies also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully file(s) for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies to break that link.</p>

<p>If you require details of those credit reference and fraud prevention agencies from whom we obtain and with whom we share your personal information or further details about the use of your personal information by credit reference and fraud prevention agencies please contact our Data Protection Act Services Team (see section below, <strong>Maintaining the personal information we hold for you</strong>).</p>

<h3>Network operators and service providers</h3>

<p>We may receive personal information about you from other network operators and service providers in connection with some of our services. You agree to such service providers and operators providing us with access to, and transferring to us, any of your personal information to allow us to connect you to, and to provide you with, the services.</p>

<h3>Information providers</h3>

<p>We may receive personal information about you from information providers, for example marketing lists or lifestyle, interest and preference information. We may add this information to the existing personal information we hold about you.</p>

			Who sees your personal information?
	</h3>
	<div class="content text" aria-labelledby="1465395043781">
			<p>The personal information we collect about you will be used within the Post Office Limited and, where appropriate, by and on behalf of our partner companies (see below). Exactly who sees your personal information depends on the context in which you provided it and whether or not you have given any marketing preferences. You can change your mind about your marketing preferences at any time by contacting our customer services team on 0845 611 2970, or contact us in the manner set out in any relevant product or service literature you are in receipt of.</p>

<p>Sometimes we'll share your personal information with third parties outside the Post Office.&nbsp;We may do this for the following reasons:</p>

<ul class="list-vertical list-tick-circle">
	<li><strong>To provide you with a product or service</strong>. Some of our products and services are provided in conjunction with our partner companies, and we'll need to share your personal information with them to provide you with the products or services. We make it clear in the terms and conditions for each service whether personal information will be shared with such third parties or not</li>
	<li><strong>To assist us or our partner companies in providing products or services to you</strong>.To enable third parties to provide us or our partner companies with such assistance, we may need to share your personal information with them. When we do so, these companies are required to act in accordance with our or our partner companies’ instructions and they must keep your personal information secure</li>
	<li><strong>To provide you with information about other products, services and promotions</strong>. If you have given your consent, we may share some of your personal information with our partner companies so that they can provide you with information about other products, services and promotions that may be of interest to you</li>
	<li><strong>To protect Post Office Limited or others</strong>. We may share your personal information with third parties when we believe it is necessary to protect our or another person’s rights, property, or safety. This includes exchanging personal information with third parties to protect against fraud and reduce payment risks</li>
	<li><strong>To provide personal information collected during the application process to credit reference agencies</strong>. This personal information may be recorded by them. We may give details of your account and how you manage it to them. If you do not pay us or our partner companies in full and on time credit reference agencies may record the outstanding debt. This personal information may be supplied to other organisations by credit reference agencies to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file with the credit reference agencies for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted</li>
	<li><strong>If you give us false or inaccurate information</strong> and we suspect or identify fraud we will record this and may also pass this information to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention</li>
	<li><strong>To comply with applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice</strong> or in response to a valid request from a competent authority</li>
</ul>

<p>We will only deal with third parties that we trust to treat our customers’ personal information with the same stringent controls that we apply ourselves.</p>

<p>Your personal information may be processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA) where privacy laws may not provide protection to the same level as in the UK, but before any such processing takes place we will take steps to ensure that your personal information will be adequately protected as required by the Data Protection Act.</p>

			Keeping your personal information secure
	</h3>
	<div class="content text" aria-labelledby="1465395043789">
			<p>We take the security of your personal information seriously.</p>

<p>We've implemented technology and security policies, rules and measures to protect the personal information we have under our control, both on and offline, from improper access, use, alteration, destruction and loss.</p>

<p>Here are some of the ways we protect your personal information:</p>

<ul class="list-vertical list-tick-circle">
	<li>If you provide personal information to us online the transmission of that information to us is protected by SSL 128 bit session encryption.&nbsp; Encryption is the process through which sensitive information is scrambled before it is transmitted so that it remains private even if it is intercepted. However, unless your internet browser supports 128-bit encryption you will not be able to take advantage of this level of security</li>
	<li>Offline, your personal information is kept securely in our databases and offices, or, where relevant, by our partner companies</li>
</ul>

<p>We will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information, but data can never be guaranteed as 100% secure. Please note that we will not be liable for any breach of security unless we have been negligent.</p>
