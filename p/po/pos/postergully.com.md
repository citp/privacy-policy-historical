Welcome to PosterGully.com! By using the website, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully. ****

**Privacy Policy**  

PosterGully ( " **PosterGully.com** ",” **PosterGully** ”, " **we** ", " **us** ", or " **our** ") value the private nature of your personal information. We have implemented the “Privacy Policy” to inform you how we treat the information we collect from you, how we collect it, and what we do with it.

**How we collect information  **

We collect "personal" information from you only when you provide it to us. For example, if you purchase a poster, art print or merchandise from us, we may collect your name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, email address etc. If you sign up to receive a newsletter, we will collect your email address. If you take advantage of special services offered by us, we may collect other personal information about you.

**What we do with your information**    
  


At PosterGully we value your trust in us! Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your e-mail address with any other company for their marketing purposes without your consent. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We may use your personal information for internal purposes such as keeping you informed of your order or providing, maintaining, evaluating and improving our products and services. 

PosterGully.com has partnered with a leading credit card/debit card processing company to assist us in processing your payment. However, those companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We may disclose the personal and non-personal information of our customers to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires our business. We may need to disclose your personal information when required by law or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.

**Links to other websites**    
  


PosterGully.com may contain some links to other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of such other websites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our website.

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. 

**How we protect your information**  

  
The security of your personal information is important to us at PosterGully.com. Hence, we've partnered with India's leading Payment gateway for our online payment services. When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number on our registration or order forms, they encrypt that information using our secure socket layer technology (SSL). For purchases of posters, prints and merchandise made online with credit cards, the payment gateway stores your card number in encrypted form for a limited amount of time, and our employees at PosterGully.com do not have access to this information. We do not store PIN data or 3-digit security codes.   
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access or disclosure, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we try our best to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions.
