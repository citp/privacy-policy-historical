### Security

As you will probably be aware, the internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures by way of reasonable measures to protect your information. We consider the security of your personal data and the details of any transactions you make to be a matter of the highest priority. Your account information is protected by your account code and password which you should keep safe at all times. In addition to your password, we generate keys which are used to authenticate your account against our servers when you are querying the database. Keys are a randomly generated and unique set of letters and numbers. If you feel that there has been a breach in the security on your licence please contact us on +44 1905 888 550 or by email at [security@loqate.co.uk](mailto:security@loqate.co.uk).

### Purchasing

When you place an order with us, we use a secure server. Any data you provide to us, is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is a widely used measure to guard against Internet messages being intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL. To be sure, you will need Netscape version 4.05 or above, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4 or above, or any similar generation browser (e.g. Firefox, Opera). Although your account can be set up to make repeat purchases to automatically top-up your account by credit card, we do not actually store credit card details. We only hold the last 4 digits of your card, the card holder name and a reference to the last transaction made on that card from us. It is the transaction reference that is used to make repeat purchases and this can only be used between ourselves and our payment service provider, SecureTrading.
