# Postcode Anywhere Privacy Policy

The purpose of this document is to bring to your attention Postcode Anywhere (Europe) Ltd's policy regarding the use of, and protection of, personal data stored on our systems. It also explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

## Use of personal information

There are a number of areas within the Postcode Anywhere website which record personal data, including the: registration; billing; contact; invoice; and account sections. The information requested within these sections is standard and includes name, address, phone number and email details and is collected for the purpose of administering your account (this will therefore include: registering your account; processing any orders which you make; communicating with you on any matter relating to the conduct of your account; and the provision of our services to you in general).

Where we are undertaking any services in collaboration with a third party (this will be clear from either the branding or notices on the website), then we may be required in order to provide the respective services, to share your account details with such third party in order to administrate the account (in a similar manner as mentioned above) and provide the respective services.

We will also need to share details about your use of our services with our data licensors and authorised resellers, with such details including the number of users and volume of transactions, so that appropriate licence fees and other payments can be calculated.

We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual.

We may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any other service or products we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, you will have the opportunity on our website at the time of registration to make this clear, and subsequently if you change your mind you can send an email with such a request to support@postcodeanywhere.co.uk.

## Email addresses

We collect email addresses for 3 main purposes.

  * Email is our preferred means of communication, and will be used to notify our customers of developments within the Postcode Anywhere services.
  * We use email to administer your account, for example, by alerting you when your account balance reaches a given level.
  * The email address on registration will be used to authenticate users who have forgotten passwords or user account IDs.



## Where We Process Your Personal Data

Although we process your data within the European Economic Area ("EEA"), owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred in transit to other countries outside the EEA that do not have similar protections in place as the EEA regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. By submitting your information you consent to such transfers outside the EEA.

We may also have third party companies providing hosting services for us. Such third party companies will act as our subcontractors, and they would hold your data for such hosting purposes only. Such subcontractors will not be provided with any permission for any other use or disclosure of your data. We will also ensure that we have reasonable safeguards in place with regard to any of our subcontractors, with regard to data retention and security.

## Compliance & Confidentiality

Our company complies with its obligations under the applicable data protection legislation in England. It will also take reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data.

Our employees and contractors have been made aware of their responsibility to keep your information confidential.

## Security

As you will probably be aware, the internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures by way of reasonable measures to protect your information.

We consider the security of your personal data and the details of any transactions you make to be a matter of the highest priority.

Your account information is protected by your account code and password which you should keep safe at all times. In addition to your password, we generate keys which are used to authenticate your account against our servers when you are querying the database. Keys are a randomly generated and unique set of letters and numbers.

If you feel that there has been a breach in the security on your licence please contact us on (01905) 888550 or by email at security@postcodeanywhere.co.uk.

## Purchasing

When you place an order with us, we use a secure server. Any data you provide to us, is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is a widely used measure to guard against Internet messages being intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL. To be sure, you will need Netscape version 4.05 or above, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4 or above, or any similar generation browser (e.g. Firefox, Opera).

Although your account can be set up to make repeat purchases to automatically top-up your account by credit card, we do not actually store credit card details. We only hold the last 4 digits of your card, the card holder name and a reference to the last transaction made on that card from us. It is the transaction reference that is used to make repeat purchases and this can only be used between ourselves and our payment service provider, SecureTrading.

## Protecting your data

Over and above what our company does to protect your privacy and security, we would advise you to adopt the following additional measures:

  * Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess.
  * Change your password regularly, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure.
  * Do not activate Autocomplete (Internet Explorer) or any similar feature.
  * Do not allow your internet browser to 'remember' passwords.
  * When you have finished your session on our website we recommend that you close your browser, so any history of the session is cleared. As a further security measure our website will automatically shut down your session if it is not used for more than 20 minutes.
  * Clear any 'cache' so there is no record of any transactions left on screen - all major web browsers let you do this.
