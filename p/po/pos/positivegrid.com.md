### Positive Grid Respects Your Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. At Positive Grid, we have a few fundamental principles:

– We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.  
– We don’t store personal information unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.  
– We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  
– We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information you share with us

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about the privacy policy, please contact us at support@positivegrid.com.

1) GENERAL PURPOSE FOR WHICH DATA ARE USED  
All personal data acquired and/or requested, either prior to or during the course of contractual relationship, will be used to fulfill your requirements, ensuring that the contractual obligations are met and administrative and legal obligations are provided correctly by the company Positive Grid, thereby allowing the business activities associated to its objectives to be conducted as efficiently as possible. The supply of data is not mandatory but is necessary in order to set up and execute this agreement; refusal to provide such data may therefore prevent the company from establishing a working relationship with you. Furthermore, your non-sensitive personal data provided with your express consent, revocable at any time, has been obtained, for the following additional uses:  
a) inclusion in Positive Grid’s data bases for the purpose of sending business notices/information relating to commercial activities conducted by Positive Grid;  
b) use for statistical purposes in connection with promotional campaigns;  
c) circulating of personal data, including in the form of images and/or videos within the company’s official website.

2) PROCESSING METHODS  
Data will be processed using appropriate methods and tools that guarantee their confidentiality and may be processed using electronic or automated means (network data processing systems not accessible to the public) and using non-automated means (paper-based archives and records), both protected by appropriate security measures such as personalised passwords offering exclusive access, personal identity codes and limited access to records.  
Certain types of data that are considered sensitive by the law (such as data capable of revealing racial and ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or other convictions, political opinion, membership of political parties, trade unions, associations or organisations of a religious, philosophical, political or trade union nature, as well as personal data capable of revealing state of health or sexual activities), which we could be made aware, after being informed by yourself or after having processed documents furnished by you, at the start up or during the course of a working relationship with our Company, may only be used with your prior written consent.

3) TRANSFER OF DATA  
Personal data supplied may not be transferred by our Company, except  
a) only in the circumstances outlined by law, for the purpose of supplying the service requested and/or executing the agreement, in order to fulfill administrative, accounting and/or fiscal obligations referred to under point 1). In such circumstances, your express consent is not required, but failure to provide it will prevent the Company from setting up a working relationship or responding to your request;  
b) solely to outside associates of the company Positive Grid, acting as tax and/or accountancy consultants, for the performance of the tasks described under point 1). Again, in these circumstances, your express consent is not required, but failure to provide it will prevent the Company from setting up a working relationship or responding to your request;  
c) to subsidiary companies and/or companies in which shares are held, sales networks (agents, dealers, collaborators and/or distributors), customer service and support agents, sub-suppliers and sub-contractors involved in conducting agreement / contractual or business relations.  
Your data can only be circulated or transferred for the purpose list stated in point 3) and with your express prior consent.

COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA OFF LINE  
If Positive Grid processes personal data off-line (e.g.: printed forms), the party concerned must be given an information notice regarding the processing in order to obtain their consent, whenever necessary; this also applies to situations in which the data are collected from forms downloaded from the web site (the privacy statement is set out on the forms together with, whenever necessary, the request for express consent to the specific handling operation in question).

COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA ON LINE  
As regards to the collection of data directly on the web site (e.g.: registration forms, data sent in order to benefit from services online), the basic information relating to the processing is provided on each individual form found on the site (e.g.: at the end of each registration form); this page can however be accessed at any time in order to view the PRIVACY POLICY applied more generally by Positive Grid.  
Every request for information regarding the processing of personal data, whether optional, explicit or voluntary, made by electronic mail, necessarily requires the address of the sender/applicant to be given, as well as any further personal data included in the message, in order that a reply can be submitted.

NAVIGATION WITHOUT REGISTRATION

NAVIGATION WITH REGISTRATION  
Registration is necessary in order to benefit from a number of services, such as purchasing and registering goods (hardware and software) online, downloading applications and software free of charge, receiving business communications/information, taking part in online forums, taking part or signing up for events/sessions.
