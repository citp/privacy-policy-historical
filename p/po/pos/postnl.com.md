# Privacy Policy | PostNL | Welcome to PostNL's corporate website, offering company news and information for investors, press, and other stakeholders.

## Privacy Policy

**PostNL N.V. and its group companies (hereinafter called “PostNL”) aim to deliver top-quality services, and reliability is a significant factor in this endeavour. This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site. This site is governed by applicable Dutch laws. Where necessary, you will find a supplementary privacy statement for a particular service or product with specific information on which data we record and how we use this data.**

### Your Consent

By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Active Information Collection

Like many websites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on).

Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as e-mail alerts or newsletter subscriptions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what for.

### Passive Information Collection

As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags and navigational data collection.

This site uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet; it is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet) rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report statistical information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.

A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.

"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect statistical information.

"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., passwords), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences. This site uses cookies mainly to store your default preferences.

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to block the placing of cookies at all, but you should realize that this can limit the use of our website or services.

You can find out more about cookies at [www.cookiecentral.com/faq](http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq).

Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your personally identifiable information where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.

### Use of registration details

To make use of our products and services users are generally required to register and provide registration details, such as name, address, postcode, gender, e-mail address and bank account number. The registration details are primarily used to send the user information concerning our services and to handle billing and direct debit where applicable.

### E-mail address

If you subscribe to our e-mail alerts, we collect your e-mail address. This address will only be used for communicating with you and keeping you informed of new developments concerning the products and services of PostNL and other related companies if you have indicated that you wish to receive such information. If you no longer wish to receive this information you can unsubscribe [here] or by clicking the unsubscribe link included in every e-mail we send.

### Access and Correction

To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as about any incorrect information. We will update or correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site.

### Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.

### Links to Other Websites

This site may contain links or references to other websites. Please be aware that we do not control other websites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

### Changes

PostNL reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy. You agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to determine the current terms to which you are bound.

### Questions

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or regarding any of our products or services please [send an e-mail](mailto:niels.bierman@postnl.nl).
