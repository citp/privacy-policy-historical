  * You have been using one or several of our services.



If you visit our website or use our app, you may, in some cases, share personal data with us.

## Why do we process your personal data?

We process your personal data because we seek to provide you with personalised services. We use information relating to you which we have stored for this purpose, so as to enable us to assist you as quickly and efficiently as we can if you have any questions regarding any of our services. By ‘processing’, we mean storing, analysing, altering/updating/modifying, deleting, forwarding, etc.

## With whom do we share this personal data?

As a rule, we do not share your data with any individuals or organisations outside PostNL, except when this is necessary to provide the service we have promised you, for example if you are using our Relocation Service. In this case, you indicate which companies should receive your address change through PostNL. In some cases, we may be required to provide personal data, for example when reporting cases of fraud.

## How long do we store your data?

  * For what purpose do we store your data?
  * How long are we required by law to store the data?



## How do we protect your personal data?

We seek to treat your data with the highest level of security in the following ways:   


  * We spend a significant amount of time and money on protecting our systems containing personal data. We have a specific department for this purpose: Cybersecurity.
  * If there is a problem involving our security, causing people outside PostNL to be able to view the personal data, or if there is a situation which creates a risk of the data being compromised, we make a record of this and handle the situation with care. We report these incidents to the regulator, and, if necessary, to you.
  * Only employees who require access to your data can view this data. All our employees have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which remains in force even after they have left the company.
  * Our data processing operations are supervised by two organisations and a dedicated Data Protection Officer: 
    * The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) monitors whether we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.
    * The Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM) monitors whether we deal appropriately with: 
      * Cookies
      * Direct marketing
      * The National Do Not Call Registry (bel-me-niet-register)
    * The Data Protection Officer monitors whether PostNL handles personal data appropriately, and its legal duties are provided for under the law. The Data Protection Officer reports directly to the management board. If you have any questions for the Data Protection Officer, please send an e-mail to: [fg@postnl.nl](mailto:fg@postnl.nl).
