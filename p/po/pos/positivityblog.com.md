All the email lists on this website (one is free as mentioned above and the rest is connected to our premium course material delivery and course signup availability) are double optin email lists. This means that person subscribing has to click the button in the email that was sent to confirm their subscription. And this procedure is set in place to make sure we get that subscriber's clear consent to send him or her emails via the email list.

  *  **Data encryption:**  This website is secured with SSL encryption, which means that all traffic to and from our servers is encrypted. This also applies to our own administrative access to the website.
  *  **Selection of third party service providers:**  we use a minimal number of third party service providers, but some are essential for the provision of physical hosting environments and email list services. One of the core factors in the selection of such providers is their ability to provide secure systems and processes.

Security breaches is regularly scanned for by using dedicated security software and all programs used on this website are always updated to the latest version. If any data breach was to be detected then all other tasks are put on hold and the breach becomes the top priority to handle.

We receive data about email list subscribers from Aweber.com that hosts all of our email lists. Such data could for example be what emails a particular and subscribed email address has opened or how long they have been subscribed to that a certain email list.

We can also access limited information about our customers that have joined the premium courses via fastspring.com's payment processing. That includes information about the name and email address of the customer but not the payment information (this is protected and safely stored by fastspring.com).
