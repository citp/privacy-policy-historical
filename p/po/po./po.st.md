# Privacy Policy - RadiumOne - We Know Your Next Customer

**Last updated: April 30, 2015  **

RadiumOne is a digital advertising company. We value the privacy of consumers (“ **Users** , “ **you”** , “ **your”** ) who visit our website at [http://radiumone.com](http://radiumone.com/) (the “ **Site”** ) as well as other websites and mobile applications where our technology is enabled (together, the “ **Platform”** ). In this Privacy Policy we use the terms “ **RadiumOne”** , “ **our”** , “ **us”**  and “ **we”**  to refer to RadiumOne, Inc., RadiumOne UK Ltd., and our affiliates.

The RadiumOne technology (the “ **Technology”** ) gathers User information from the Platform to optimize the delivery of digital advertising to Users. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain what information we gather, how we use it, what we do to protect it, and your choices regarding how we gather and use information about you. ** **

**About Our Advertising Services**

RadiumOne provides online display, mobile, video, and social advertising services. In order to provide our services, we buy advertising space from hundreds of websites and mobile applications around the world and resell it in targeted packages to advertisers and agencies (“ **Targeted Advertising”** ). Targeted Advertising is displayed (a) on the browsers of devices such as computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones or (b) inside mobile applications. Users benefit from Targeted Advertising by receiving advertisements (“ **ads”** ) which are more interesting and relevant than untargeted ads, while advertisers benefit through the more efficient delivery of ads to interested Users.

Targeted Advertising is based on data that does not personally identify you and is collected from your devices as described below in “ _What Information We Collect”._ Data used in Targeted Advertising may range from your (i) interests, (ii) similarities to other Users, (iii) general demographic information, and (iv) general geographic location. This non-personally identifiable information may be used to classify Users who are most likely to respond to an ad. We do not intentionally collect information that identifies you (such as your name, address, phone number, or email address), and we prohibit our partners from sharing this information with us.

**What Information We Collect**

The information we collect falls into two categories – **Browser-Based Data** and **Mobile App-Based Data**.

For information about opting out from the collection of Browser-Based Data and Mobile App-Based Data, please visit the Opting Out section by clicking [here](http://radiumone.com/opt/).

_Browser-Based Data_

  * Cookies. Many websites use cookies to improve the User experience, and we use cookies in connection with our Technology. When you visit our Site or another website or page that displays one of our targeted ads or contains our pixel tags (also called clear gifs or web beacons), we may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your browser. Cookies enable us to store a non-personally identifiable RadiumOne User browser ID that is used for matching certain non-personally identifiable information that we collect via the browser. For more information about the types of cookies that we use, the purposes for which we use them and how you can opt out, click [here](http://radiumone.com/use-of-cookies/).


  * Ad Serving and Web Navigation Information. We may collect non-personally identifiable browser-based information regarding how you use the Platform and how you interact with the ads that the Platform displays (together, “ **Ad Serving and Web Navigation Information”** ).

When you use the Po.st services, we may receive Ad Serving and Web Navigation Information, including the URL content shared by a user (together, the “ **Po.st Information** ”). We can also discern which channel was used for sharing or receiving content (e.g. a social network or email). In addition, if you use Po.st to send an URL link to another user, and the user clicks on the sent URL link, we may also receive Ad Serving and Web Navigation information related to this user.

When you use RadiumOne Engage advertising services, we may receive Ad Serving and Web Navigation Information, including (i) information about the game in which the advertising offer was placed, (ii) whether the User has clicked on the advertising offer, and (iii) whether the advertising offer was completed by the User (together, the “ **RadiumOne Engage Information”** ).



_Mobile Application-Based Data_

  * Device IDs. If you are using the Platform via a mobile application, we may use the Apple IFA, Android Advertiser ID, or other non-personally identifiable device information that uniquely identifies a mobile device (collectively, “ **Device IDs”** ) in order to match certain non-personally identifiable information that we collect via the mobile application.


  * Ad Serving Information. We may collect non-personally identifiable mobile-application-based information about how you interact with the ads that the Platform displays (together, “ **Ad Serving Information”** ). This Ad Serving Information may include the following: whether the User has (i) clicked on the ad of a RadiumOne advertiser, (ii) installed this advertiser’s application, or (iii) undertaken a transaction with this advertiser inside the downloaded application.


  * API or SDK Information.

When a User accesses an application that implements the RadiumOne Software, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable User data, including: (i) technographic data related to the device (such as Device ID, device model, and operating system), (ii) information related to the application that implements the API or SDK (such as the version of the third party application, the SDK or the API being used), (iii) certain information relating to the applications installed on a mobile device (such as a list of the applications installed on the device), (iv) connection data (such as the IP address and mobile country or network code used to access the API or SDK), and (v) various data relating to the User (such as latitude and longitude, language preferences, or self-reported demographic data, including age, income, education or ethnicity).

_Other Sources of Information_

  * We may acquire, use or re-sell to our self-service clients non-personally identifiable information from third party sources that may be used as is or in combination with Browser-Based Data and Mobile App-Based Data to optimize the delivery of digital advertising to Users.

**How We Use and Disclose Information**

  * In General. RadiumOne uses the information collected by the Technology to tailor advertising to you more effectively. The aim is to show you ads in which you are more likely to be interested.

Data used in your User profile may range from your (i) interests, (ii) similarities to other Users, (iii) general demographic information, and (iv) general geographic location. This data is collected from your devices as described above in “ _What Information We Collect.”_


  * Cross-App Advertising, Ad Delivery and Reporting. When you use a mobile device, we may use the information collected by the Technology regarding your use of the apps on your device to deliver Targeted Advertising based on the interests that we infer from your use of the mobile apps on the device (“ **Cross-App Advertising** ”). We may also use the information collected about the device for the purpose of delivering ads or providing related services such as delivering ads on the basis of a particular time of the day, optimizing the placement, performance, reach and frequency of our ads, and for statistical reporting and analytics purposes (“ **Ad Delivery and Reporting”** ).


  * Please note that we do not sell or transfer ownership of Browser-Based Data and Mobile App-Based Data to third parties.
