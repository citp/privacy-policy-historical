# Privacy Policy - Po.st: Social sharing buttons that generate revenue

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Po.st, which is owned and operated by RadiumOne, Inc. (“RadiumOne,” “we,” or “us”), and the Service, as described in the Po.st [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231045509id_/http%3A//www.po.st/terms.html). This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use and disclose that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Po.st [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231045509id_/http%3A//www.po.st/terms.html). The practices described in this policy apply only to our use of information supplied by you to us through the Po.st Site and Service and do not apply to the RadiumOne website or other websites where our advertising technology ("Technology") is enabled, which are governed by the [RadiumOne Privacy Policy](http://radiumone.com/about/privacy.html). Information collected from you by others, such as third party websites that you access through links on the Service, may also be governed by those entities’ privacy policies.

  * [ ](http://rp.gwallet.com/r1/optout?optout&post "Opt Out")




Please note that opting out does not mean you will not see advertisements online, but only that these advertisements will not be tailored based on your online interests from RadiumOne as an individual vendor.

#### The Information We Collect

  * _Collection of Information_. We do not collect information that we can trace back to a specific User or sensitive consumer information, such as insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or information about medical conditions. All of our profiles are anonymous and relate to a browser rather than a specific individual. While we may be able to associate interests and intent to purchase with specific profiles, we cannot match that anonymous profile with specific individuals. 
  * _Cookies_. RadiumOne uses cookies in connection with our Technology. When a user accesses a webpage that contains our sharing tools or utilizes our link shortening or video embedding services, we may add a cookie to the user’s browser to record information on websites that the user has visited, search terms that they have entered, or connections between anonymous cookies, but strictly in an anonymous profile. For our video embedding services, we may also track information related to the videos that you share, including social statistics and information relating to the parties accessing the video, but only as an anonymous profile. We may use this information to customize and send more relevant advertisements to that user, based upon the collected information, as described below in the section entitled, “How We Use and Disclose Information.” We do not scan the title or the content of any messages you send through our services. The RadiumOne cookie, in particular, is not spyware or adware and does not harm your computer in any way. You may choose to disable cookies on your browser by adjusting your browser settings. 
  * _Automatically Collected Information_. We may also collect a variety of automatically collected information from your browser or computer using the Technology, including “pixel tags”, “clear gifs”, or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may also include request-based information which is passed to us by the User's computer browser with every request and is stored entirely anonymously. Examples of this include your Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), web browser type, the websites that you visit just before or just after a website on our ad network, and the dates and times that you visit a website on our ad network. We may also collect session information relating to Users and specific ad campaigns, which is used for frequency capping, or limiting the number of times a User sees a specific ad and targeting of Users according to their specific interests. 
  * _Click Information_. We may receive information when you click on or otherwise interact with ads deployed using the Technology, including a specific type of ad that we may serve you that allows you to "like" an ad by clicking on a button near the ad. The information received by us may include information about the ad that was clicked on, the web page, or other session-based and request-based information as described above. We may also receive information regarding any links that you may click on that are associated with ads deployed using the Technology, or any links that you share or receive from third parties related to those ads. 
  * _Information Acquired from Other Sources_. We may acquire anonymous data from third party sources. This data cannot be used to identify specific individuals and is used to update existing User profiles. We do not share, rent or sell any of the data acquired from third party sources, and we require these third party sources to be privacy compliant in their use of personal information. 



#### How We Use and Disclose Information

  * _In General_. RadiumOne uses the information collected by the Technology to tailor advertising to you more effectively. The aim is to show you ads that might interest you. We do this by comparing the information relating to your browser's anonymous profile (including websites visited or search terms entered) against our selection of ad campaigns and using this information to select the most suitable advertisement for you. In no event will we combine the anonymous information that we collect with personally identifiable information. 
  * _ShareGraph Technology_. RadiumOne uses its “ShareGraph” technology to help our clients deliver relevant online advertisements. ShareGraph provides us with a method of connecting profiles of users who have shared links, applications, or other content through e-mail or sharing widgets with other parties. The edges of a ShareGraph may also be modeled based on frequency, recency, directionality, and types of sharing between two Users. We use ShareGraph to find Users who are likely to share similar interests and purchase histories. For example, if a person expresses an interest in adventure travel, our Technology helps our clients identify other people who are likely to enjoy adventure travel based on similarities in the ShareGraph between the different people. By using our Technology, our clients can categorize people with similar characteristics, interests or purchase intent, improving their ability to deliver more relevant advertising. In the event that you opt-out of our service, we stop providing this information to our clients. 
  * _Service Providers_. RadiumOne works with authorized service providers to provide website hosting, maintenance, and other services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their obligations to us, these service providers may have access to User information. However, we contractually require these service providers to safeguard User information and strictly limit their use of User information to the purpose for which it was shared. Should such service providers be located outside of the European Economic Area, we will make sure that the information is adequately protected also outside of the European Economic Area. 



#### Data Retention

RadiumOne maintains all server log data and stored data as long as legally required in order to comply with audits, court order or law enforcement inquiries. Summarized data is kept indefinitely. Summarized data is aggregated statistical data (impressions and clicks) used for financial reporting purposes.

#### Security

RadiumOne uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of User information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store data. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any User information. We will post a notice on the Site in that event a breach of our security occurs.

#### In the Event of Merger or Sale

In the event that RadiumOne is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

#### Children's Privacy

RadiumOne is very sensitive to the importance of children's privacy and employs a zero-tolerance approach to advertising to children. RadiumOne's websites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. RadiumOne does not employ or offer targeting towards children under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided RadiumOne with personal information or registered at one of RadiumOne's websites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.

#### Changes to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by a “last modified” date below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.
