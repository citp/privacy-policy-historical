# Privacy Statement for Poetry.com

## PRIVACY POLICY  
SECURE ORDERING

At Poetry.com, we value our customers and respect their privacy. We collect customer information in an effort to improve your overall experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests, and promotions. We recognize that we must maintain and use customer information responsibly.

We may use information that you provide to tell you about carefully screened products which we feel may be of interest to you. Also, we may share our customer information and your general shopping activity information. This information will be used to provide you with information on certain carefully-selected products and services, including products or services that are similar to ours, or that we feel may be of interest to our users. We do this because most of our customers enjoy being introduced to new or value oriented products/services. When you register at Poetry.com and you leave the box checked stating “Yes I want to receive information and offers from Poetryoffers.com,” you explicitly authorize us to share your information with Datran Media to contact you via e-mail. In addition, we sometimes use e-mail addresses to contact visitors who communicate with us. For example, we send e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes, such as our regular newsletter with topics of interest relating to poetry, providing information about promotions from us or our partners, or responding to an inquiry.

Poetry.com may collect usage information when you visit Poetry.com. Website usage information is not personally identifiable information. It describes how our website is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stay. It also includes the domain names of users and browser types that visit our website, the time of day the website was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information. All information collected will be used to improve the shopping experience at Poetry.com.

We also use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use the Site. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and are read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Our primary use of cookies is to improve your experience on our website. For example, storing a cookie on your computer allows you to login without typing your e-mail address and password each time. 

If for any reason you do not wish to receive communications from Poetry.com or from affiliated third- party merchants, or any interested third parties from whom we think you may want to receive information, just tell us. Call us at 410-356-2000, and one of our customer service representatives will gladly assist you, or contact us through the "contact us" section of this Site. Also, we provide a direct link for you to easily opt out of our various e-mail promotions that provide information about the special opportunities we offer.

Poetry.com takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between users and the websites. Certain pages of the websites, including those that offer users the opportunity to provide credit card information for purchases, use Secured Socket Layers (SSL) encryption. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open communications network, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Poetry.com and information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. Users understand and acknowledge this risk when communicating with and providing information to the Site. Verisign provides authentication that you are communicating over a secure connection with Poetry.com.

As Poetry.com continues to explore new business opportunities, it may need to, and reserves the right to transfer and assign customer contact and Site usage information collected on the Site to one or more affiliated and unaffiliated entities as part of a business transaction.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy or information security, you can contact Poetry.com's customer service in any of three ways: 

  1. call us at 410-356-2000;
  2. write to us at Poetry.com Customer Service, 1 Poetry Plaza, Owings Mills, MD 21117; or 
  3. send us a message through the "contact us" section of this Site.



We may update this policy from time to time as our information practices are modified or changed. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
