<h2>PRIVACY  POLICY<br>
SECURE ORDERING</h2>
<p>At  Poetry.com, we value our customers and respect their privacy. We collect  customer information in an effort to improve your overall experience and to  communicate with you about our products, services, contests, and promotions. We  recognize that we must maintain and use customer information responsibly.</p>
<p>
  We may use information that you provide to tell you about  carefully screened products which we feel may be of interest to you. Also, we  may share our customer information and your general shopping activity  information. This information will be used to provide you with information on  certain carefully-selected products and services, including products or  services that are similar to ours, or that we feel may be of interest to our  users. We do this because most of our customers enjoy being introduced to new  or value oriented products/services. When you register at Poetry.com and you  leave the box checked stating “Yes I want to receive information and offers  from Poetryoffers.com,” you explicitly authorize us to share your information  with Datran Media to contact you via e-mail. In addition, we sometimes use  e-mail addresses to contact visitors who communicate with us. For example, we  send e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific  purposes, such as our regular newsletter with topics of interest relating to  poetry, providing information about promotions from us or our partners, or  responding to an inquiry.</p>
<p>
  Poetry.com  may collect usage information when you visit Poetry.com. Website usage  information is not personally identifiable information. It describes how our  website is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors  to each web page and the length of their stay. It also includes the domain  names of users and browser types that visit our website, the time of day the  website was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information. All  information collected will be used to improve the shopping experience at  Poetry.com.</p>
<p>
  We  also use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored in a  browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use the Site.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and are read by a web server in  the domain that issued the cookie to you. Our primary use of cookies is to  improve your experience on our website. For example, storing a cookie on your  computer allows you to login without typing your e-mail address and password  each time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
  If  for any reason you do not wish to receive communications from Poetry.com or  from affiliated third- party merchants, or any interested third parties from  whom we think you may want to receive information, just tell us. Call us at  410-356-2000, and one of our customer service representatives will gladly  assist you, or contact us through the "contact us" section of this  Site. Also, we provide a direct link for you to easily opt out of our various  e-mail promotions that provide information about the special opportunities we  offer.</p>
<p>
  Poetry.com  takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between users  and the websites. Certain pages of the websites, including those that offer  users the opportunity to provide credit card information for purchases, use  Secured Socket Layers (SSL) encryption. However, due to the inherent nature of  the Internet as an open communications network, we cannot guarantee that  communications between you and Poetry.com and information stored on our servers  will be free from unauthorized access. Users understand and acknowledge this  risk when communicating with and providing information to the Site. <img align="left" src="/include/common/onlineorders/verisign_logo.gif" width="96" height="41" border="0" alt="Verisign Logo" style="padding-right:.5em">Verisign  provides authentication that you are communicating over a secure connection  with Poetry.com.</p>
<p>
  As  Poetry.com continues to explore new business opportunities, it may need to, and  reserves the right to transfer and assign customer contact and Site usage  information collected on the Site to one or more affiliated and unaffiliated  entities as part of a business transaction.</p>

<p>
