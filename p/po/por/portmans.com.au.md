### Respecting your privacy and the law – our commitment to you

We recognise that your personal information is important to you and we share your concerns about how and what personal information is collected, used and shared. Your rights to privacy are protected by law, and this policy does not limit those rights.

  * help us gain a better understanding of your likes and dislikes, so as to improve our website, marketing strategies and the products and services generally offered by us. 



### Your email address

We will only record your email address if you provide it to us. We will only use it to send you information you have requested about any of the services or products we provide through our website, or for another use for which you have provided it. It will not be used for any unauthorised purpose or disclosed without your consent (unless permitted by law). By providing us with your email address, you will have given your consent to receive direct marketing materials from us together with other Just Group brands or carefully selected third parties. If you do not wish to consent or receive any communication from us, you can select the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of any email we send you, or you can notify [privacyofficer@jjh.com.au](mailto:privacyofficer@jjh.com.au).

### No Spam

### Competitions

When you enter a competition through our website, social media channels or in our stores, you may be required to provide information to satisfy the entry conditions. Entry constitutes entrants' consent to their personal information to be used by the Just Group's brands for compiling its customer database and for marketing purposes. The Just Group may provide you with joint promotional offers in conjunction with other third parties. These promotional offers are developed in line with your needs, but should you not wish to receive this information, you can select the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of any email we send you, or you can notify [privacyofficer@jjh.com.au](mailto:privacyofficer@jjh.com.au).

### Information collected automatically – Cookies etc. 

Whenever you visit our website, our servers automatically record information about your usage of our website through 'cookies' and clickstream data.

Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device. Cookies and clickstream data are used to maintain session information between your browser and our website and identify things related to your use of the website such as the time, date and URL of the pages you visit, your IP address, your location and browser software. Some computers and mobile devices also permit your location to be shared with us (often referred to as geo-location data). Most browsers can notify you when a new cookie is received, or let you turn off cookies or geo-location services altogether. Turning off these services may mean some features on our website are not available to you. 

We use information obtained this way in order to learn about your preferences so that we may improve our website and the service offered through it.

### When do we disclose your personal information to third parties

We will often need to pass your personal information to companies who perform part of our service delivery. The relevant organisations include those:

  * involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service such as third party suppliers, other Just Group organisations, loyalty and affinity program partners, printers, posting services and call centres; 
  * which are Just Group brands or carefully selected third parties who wish to tell you about their products or services that might better serve your online and lifestyle needs, promotions or other opportunities; 
  * involved in maintaining, reviewing and developing our business systems, procedures and infrastructure including testing or upgrading our computer systems; 
  * involved in a transfer of all or part of the assets or business of a Just Group organisation; 
  * involved in the payments system including financial institutions, merchants and payment organisations; 
  * as required or authorised by law, for example, to government or regulatory bodies for purposes related to public health or safety, the prevention or detection of unlawful activities or to protect public revenue; or 
  * where you have given your consent. 



Your personal information may be disclosed by us for a secondary purpose: 

  * where you have consented to the use or disclosure; and
  * if you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information for a secondary purpose which is directly related to the primary purpose of collection; or
  * if required or permitted by law or by a court/tribunal;
  * if we reasonably believe it is necessary for law enforcement related activities.



Because we operate throughout Australia and New Zealand (and, in the case of Smiggle, Singapore and the United Kingdom), and as noted above because we use third parties to administer some of our service delivery, some of these uses and disclosures may occur outside of your country of residence. The countries where these service providers are located vary, but include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the USA. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient does not breach relevant privacy laws or principles. 

### Keeping your personal information accurate and up-to-date

We aim to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and relevant, having regard to the purpose of use or disclosure. We will take reasonable steps to make sure this is the case. This way, we can provide you with better service.

If you believe your personal information is inaccurate, incomplete, not up to date, not relevant or misleading, please let us know (see Contact Us). We will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to correct that information to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, the information is accurate, up to date , relevant and not misleading.

  * denying access as required or authorised by or under law or court/tribunal order. 



We will give you reasons if we deny access (except to the extent that having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be unreasonable to do so).
