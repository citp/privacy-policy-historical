## Privacy Policy

  1. **Privacy is important.**  
We recognise that privacy of personal information is important to individuals. Personal information for our business purposes is to be minimal, private, correct, safe and largely in the control of the individual. Except where otherwise legally appropriate we will treat your personal information as private. 
  2. **Your say on your privacy.**  
If you have a particular concern or query about your personal information held by us you should contact our Privacy Officer (P.O Box 2196 Richmond South Vic 3121, privacyofficer@jjh.com.au - Ph. 1800 333232) whom we have appointed for your assistance.
  3. **The nature of our business.**  
We are principally a retailer. Retailing can utilise a number of facilities and functions including shops (off the street and in shopping centres), the Internet, promotional material (using various forms including paper and electronic mail outs), credit and other card systems, lay by arrangements and reward schemes. As a successful and long established retailer we carry out any or all of these means of business from time to time. We have built an enviable reputation as one of Australia's largest specialty retailing groups upon servicing our customers.
  4. **Obtaining personal information.**  
Because of the nature of our business it is necessary to obtain personal information from time to time. We will however not be unduly intrusive nor obtain or use information in an inappropriate manner. We will only ask for and use personal information we reasonably need to conduct our business. If you have received any promotional material and do not wish to receive it then upon letting us know we will not send it to you.
  5. **Safekeeping and need to know handling.**  
As part of us keeping your personal information private we only allow access on a need to know basis.
  6. **Your access and control.**  
However, in accordance with the privacy law we give you access to your personal information we hold and you can correct misinformation (except where it would be inappropriate or exempted by law e.g. - where it would require disclosing someone else's personal information, but we will provide you with reasons).
  7. **Confidence.**  
It is important for us that persons with whom we do business have confidence that we handle information responsibly and it is our policy to do this.
