You can choose not to provide us with certain information, for example, you can choose to use our website without creating an account. However, this may restrict our ability to provide you with our services or access to certain features on our websites.

We also collect information from you automatically. Please see “Information collected automatically – Cookies etc.” below for more information about how we collect your information in this way.

We will only use it to send you information you have requested about any of the services or products we provide through our website, or for another use for which you have provided it. It will not be used for any unauthorised purpose or disclosed without your consent (unless permitted by law). By providing us with your email address, you will have given your consent to receive direct marketing materials from us together with other Just Group brands or carefully selected third parties. If you do not wish to consent or receive any communication from us, you can select the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any email we send you, or you can notify privacyofficer@jjh.com.au.

## Competitions

Entry constitutes entrants' consent to their personal information to be used by the Just Group’s brands for compiling its customer database and for marketing purposes.

These promotional offers are developed in line with your needs, but should you not wish to receive this information, you can select the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any email we send you, or you can notify privacyofficer@jjh.com.au.

## Information collected automatically - Cookies etc.

Whenever you visit our website, our servers automatically record information about your usage of our website through ‘cookies’ and clickstream data.

Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device. Cookies and clickstream data are used to maintain session information between your browser and our website and identify things related to your use of the website such as the time, date and URL of the pages you visit, your IP address, your location and browser software. Some computers and mobile devices also permit your location to be shared with us (often referred to as geo-location data). Most browsers can notify you when a new cookie is received, or let you turn off cookies or geo-location services altogether. Turning off these services may mean some features on our website are not available to you.

We use information obtained this way in order to learn about your preferences so that we may improve our website and the service offered through it.

We use two different types of cookies – session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is stored temporarily; it only lasts until you close your browser. A persistent cookie is stored on your device and lasts until you or your browser deletes them. For example, we may use cookies to store your preferences or other settings so you don’t have to set them up every time you visit our website, web portal or apps. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your account (including personal information about your logged in status, your location, the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.

We use both first party and third party cookies. First party cookies are those which we use. Third party cookies originate from one of our partners or service providers.

We use cookies and equivalent technologies for lots of essential things – like helping you log in and tailoring your experience. Here’s a chart that explains how we use cookies.

## What we use Cookies for ...and how

## When do we disclose your personal information to Third Parties

We will often need to pass your personal information to companies who perform part of our service delivery. The relevant organisations include those:

  * involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service such as third party suppliers, other Just Group organisations, loyalty and affinity program partners, printers, posting services and call centres;
  * which are Just Group brands or carefully selected third parties who wish to tell you about their products or services that might better serve your online and lifestyle needs, promotions or other opportunities, where you have opted to receive these;

  * where you have given your consent.



Your personal information may be disclosed by us for a secondary purpose:

  * where you have consented to the use or disclosure; and
  * if you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information for a secondary purpose which is directly related to the primary purpose of collection; or
  * if required or permitted by law or by a court/tribunal;
  * if we reasonably believe it is necessary for law enforcement related activities.



Because we operate throughout Australia and New Zealand (and, in the case of Smiggle, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Ireland and the United Kingdom), and as noted above because we use third parties to administer some of our service delivery, some of these uses and disclosures may occur outside of your country of residence. The countries where these service providers are located vary, but include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the USA. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient does not breach relevant privacy laws or principles.
