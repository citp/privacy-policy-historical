# Privacy Policy | Porch

### Effective Date December 11, 2014

## Privacy Policy Overview

**_Overview._** Porch.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and our affiliates (collectively, ?Porch,? ?we,? ?us?), are providing this Privacy Policy (?Privacy Policy?) with respect to all of our Services, all of which are hosted in the United States. This Privacy Policy describes our collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. All terms used in this Privacy Policy that are not defined herein have the meanings set forth in our Terms of Use.

**_Privacy Policy Updates._** We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices by updating this page and the Privacy Policy effective date above. Your continued use of the Services after the date the Privacy Policy is changed (or the posted effective date, if later) will constitute your acceptance and agreement to such changes.

**_Information You Provide._** When using the Services, you may provide information about yourself, including name, address, telephone number, email address, and payment details in connection with a potential transaction. You may provide this information, for example, when you create an account, post User Submissions, request products or services, communicate with a Pro, or complete other forms. In addition, if you are a Pro, you may provide information about yourself or company, including for example, details to complete your account, User Submissions, and reference information.

_Cookie Data._ Cookies (small data files that can be transferred to your electronic device to uniquely identify your browser) are used by the Services to connect your activity on the Services with other information we store about you in your account profile or from prior usage of the Services. For example, the use of cookies allows us to improve our Services by tracking saved searches, understanding your use of various features and functionality, measuring the effectiveness of advertising and otherwise creating a consistent user experience for you. At any time, you may adjust your browser settings to delete existing cookies, or refuse new cookies, according to the method permitted by your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, some of the Services may not operate properly.

_Log Usage Data._ Our servers automatically record usage log data created when you use the Services. Usage log data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring web page, visited web pages, location, mobile carrier, computer or mobile device type, search terms and cookie information.

_Social Networks._ If you use the social networking connection functions offered through the Services, we may access any of your social profile information that you have made available to be shared and to use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please refer to your social network policies to manage information that is shared through that account.

_Location Data._ If you provide location information during the registration process or at any other time via your account settings, we may store that information in connection with your account (including, for example, your IP address which may provide an approximate geo-location). If you are using mobile Services, we may collect location data directly from your mobile device if your device allows us to do so. Your mobile device manufacturer or mobile service provider may provide you with choices about how and whether location data is shared with us.

_Telephone Calls._ From time to time, when you call us, when we call you, or when we forward calls between users and Pros, we may record those calls for quality assurance and customer satisfaction purposes. In those jurisdictions where consent is required for a party to record a telephone call, you consent to us recording such calls.

**_Information Collected by Third Parties._** Our service providers and advertising networks use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services (including mobile applications) and your online activities over time and across different web sites. Collected information may include the content you review, the date and time you view content, and the referring web site, which information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier or IP address. Cookies may be used, for example, to deliver targeted ads or analyze visitor activity. The use of cookies or similar technologies by our service providers and advertising networks is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and other properties that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.

**_Information We Collect From Third Parties._** We may obtain information about you from third parties and use it to provide a customized experience, to suggest products or services that might be of interest to you, or to supplement or correct information that you have provided to us, and generally to improve our Services.

Any information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:

  * To provide and improve our Services to you;
  * To personalize your experience so that you may find the most relevant information;
  * To manage our customer relationship with you and to improve customer service;
  * To process transactions;
  * To connect you with the right Pros and other individuals and to optimize the information we share with these parties to initiate a productive and efficient relationship with you;
  * To help Pros select with whom they choose to work;
  * To administer a contest, promotion, contest or sweepstakes;
  * To communicate with you via email, telephone, mobile, text (SMS), postal services and the Internet to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you;
  * To prevent fraud and abuse and to otherwise protect members and visitors and our business;
  * To perform functions described at the time of collection; and
  * To develop, deliver and analyze the effectiveness of our advertising, products and services.



Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Information that you choose to provide in a public area of the Services (such as your profile page or via User Submissions) will not be protected by this Privacy Policy because you have chosen to make that information public. Otherwise, your information and aggregate information will be shared only in accordance with this Privacy Policy as follows:

**_Consent._** When you consent or direct Porch to share your information. For example, if you choose to contact a Pro through the Services, we may provide information to that Pro.

**_Porch Service Providers._** We may utilize third party service providers to help us administer, provide and improve the Services and these providers have access to your personally identifiable information only as necessary to perform services for us (e.g., we may share your credit/debit card information with our third party transaction processors only as necessary to complete your purchase, or we may utilize third party service providers to provide you with targeted messaging and advertising and these providers have access to your information only as necessary to provide these offers).

**_Co-Branded Partners._** Some of our Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party. If you use such co-branded Services both Porch and the third party may receive information provided by you or collected in conjunction with the co-branded Services. For example, If you sign-up with Porch through a Lowe's promoted or co-branded website or within a Lowe's store directly, Porch may share your information with Lowe?s.

**_Investigations and Law._** We may release personally identifiable information when we believe that doing so is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, to avoid legal liability, to cooperate with government or law enforcement or private parties; to investigate or enforce a potential violation of our Terms, policies and guidelines; to bill and collect amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, reputation, safety or property or that of users or others; and to address fraud, security or technical issues.

**_Sale/Merger:_** If we become party to a merger, acquisition, joint venture, sale or pledge of assets, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith.

Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code permits California residents to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information about the types of personal information the business has shared with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. You may make one request each year by emailing us at support@porch.com or writing us at 1551 Eastlake Ave E, Suite 275, Seattle, WA 98102.

**_Changing Information; Closing Account._** To change or delete your information, you may login to your account and modify or remove specified information that resides in your account. If you want to delete your account, please contact us at support@porch.com. Please note that although Porch will remove your account within a reasonable time after receiving your request, information that you chose to provide in a public area of the Services may remain in accounts of users with whom such information has been shared, and Porch may retain and use information in backup/archival copies for our records as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

**_Children._** The Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information about persons under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as practicable.

**_Third-Party Websites._** Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide to such a third-party is provided directly to the owner or operator of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services, and we're not responsible for their content, privacy or security practices and policies. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.

**_Security._** We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the protection of any information shared with us.

**_Contacting Us._** If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at [support@porch.com](mailto:support@porch.com) or in writing at 1551 Eastlake Ave E, Suite 275, Seattle, WA 98102.
