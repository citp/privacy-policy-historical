# PTZtv - Privacy Policy

**What information do we collect?**

You may visit our free-to-view sites anonymously and are not required to register or sign-in. If you choose to register for our PTZtv Premium service, you will be required to provide an email address.

If you choose to fill out and submit a contact or "wave request" form, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address or phone number.  
 

Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language and the date/time of your access. These logs are only used internally for debugging technical issues or tracing connection problems. Typically, they are auto-deleted after 7-30 days, depending on server application. In extrememly rare circumstances, logs may be preserved for longer periods when access is requested under subpoena from a law enforcement agency. PTZtv cooperates fully with all legitimate law enforcement inquiries.  
 

Our PTZtv Premium and PTZtv Gallery websites can involve eCommerce transactions if you choose to purchase from them. Those transactions necessitate the sharing of more personal information, including credit card numbers if that payment method is selected.  
 

PTZtv Premium transactions are handled by Tinypass/Piano and their privacy policy is [here](https://piano.io/privacy/).

PTZtv Gallery transactions are handled by SmugMug, Inc. and their privacy policy is [here](https://www.smugmug.com/about/privacy).
