We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If at any time you do not wish to receive communications from Portero, you may elect to opt-out of receiving further email by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any email promotion sent to you.

We may collect and possibly share personally identifiable information and any other information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law. We may also exchange information, including personally identifiable information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.

**Internal Use:  **We may from time to time review your personally identifiable information for errors, omissions, and accuracy. We may also use your personally identifiable information internally to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, Web Site content, and product offerings.

**Service Providers:**  Portero will not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. We may, however, share your personally identifiable information with authorized third party service providers. Examples of authorized third parties that we may share your personal information with include, but may not be limited to: web hosting companies, shipping companies, third party consulting or marketing firms, and e-mail service providers. Additionally, if you use a credit card or other financing alternative to place an order with Portero, to confirm and process your order we will share your personally identifiable information with such financing company. These third parties only receive personally identifiable information if such information is needed to perform their function(s), and they are not authorized to use any personally identifiable information for any other purpose(s).

**Sharing of Information:**  In addition to sharing information with service providers (as set forth above), we may share personal data with consignors, brand owners, retailers, and manufacturers with whom we are engaged if we believe their products may be of interest to you.

**Business Transfer:**  We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that Portero, or one of its affiliates or subsidiaries, goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our web site prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information if your personal information will be used contrary to this privacy policy. Portero specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.
