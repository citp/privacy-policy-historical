**Passive Information Collection**

This Site uses various technologies to passively collect information from you while you are visiting (that is, you do not actively provide this information). Such technologies allow the Site to collect a range of non-personally identifiable information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique identifier automatically assigned to your computer when logging onto the Internet), the type of Web browser and operating system you use, the date and time you visit the Site, the specific pages you visit on the Site, and the address of the website you visited before coming to this Site. We typically use such passively collected information for a variety of purposes, such as to administer the Site, customize the Site to your preferences, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes. We reserve the unrestricted right to use this passively collected, non-personally identifiable information for any purpose including, but not limited to, selling, leasing, permitting access to, or otherwise transferring it to our affiliates, business partners, advertisers, dealers, and other third parties.

Two types of passive information collection technologies deserve special mention:

**Cookies**

“Cookies” are small text files that store information about your interactions with a particular website, either temporarily (known as a “temporary” or “session” cookie, and deleted once you close your browser window) or more permanently on the hard drive of your computer (known as a “permanent” or “persistent cookie”). Cookies can make it easier to use a website by allowing servers to access certain information quickly.

Session cookies can be used to help a user’s browser navigate a website more smoothly and may appear if the user comes from a website with which the subsequent website has some relationship (e.g., a website of an affiliated company) and can give helpful information.

Persistent cookies can be used to customize a website for a user, such as by storing passwords, preferences, and registration and account information so that users do not have to reenter them each time they visit a website.

This Site uses both session/temporary cookies and persistent/permanent cookies to store information that allows us to offer you better customer service and to navigate through the Site with ease. To make the Site easier to use, we combine information collected via cookies with personally identifiable information. Note that if you configure your browser to reject cookies, you might not be able to access important functions or areas of the Site or enjoy certain conveniences at this Site.

**Web Beacons**

“Web beacons” (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are Internet tags that are smaller than cookies and may tell the website server non-personally identifiable information such as IP address and browser type. This Site does not use "Web beacons".

**Other Uses and Disclosures of Information**

As indicated above, we use information we collect from you via this Site for a variety of purposes. Unless otherwise provided above, we may also use personally and non-personally identifiable information you submit via this Site in the following ways:

· to tell you about new products and services or other information we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such notifications or updates, please use the "connect with us" form on designtex.com to specify which notifications or updates you do not wish to receive;

· to conduct internal marketing and research; and

· to improve the content of the Site.

From time to time, our service providers may have access to information you submit via the Site to provide operational or other support services for the Site (e.g., Web hosting or database services). We have put in place agreements with such service providers to protect against unauthorized uses or disclosures of such information.

Except as otherwise provided in the “Active Information Collection” section above, we also reserve the right to sell, lease, provide access, or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information you submit via this Site to our business partners (including e-mail delivery services and content providers), affiliates, and dealers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR ELSEWHERE ON THIS SITE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SHARE OR TRANSFER ANY INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT VIA THIS SITE TO ANOTHER PERSON OR COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, ASSIGNMENT, OR OTHER TRANSFER OF THE BUSINESS OF THIS SITE AND/OR STEELCASE INC.; TO RESPOND TO LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS; OR WHERE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, SUBPOENA, OR COURT ORDER. BY SUBMITTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION VIA THIS SITE, YOU CONSENT TO SUCH DISCLOSURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**

**Security Measures**

We use standard industry physical, electronic and administrative precautions to protect and safeguard the information you provide to us. Nevertheless, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Therefore, use the Site at your own risk.

### Information Access

We take reasonable measure to ensure that personally identifiable information that we collect from you via this Site is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended uses. If you wish to update or otherwise correct personally identifiable information you have provided to us, please resubmit the applicable form on the Site with the updated information. If you have questions related to employment, use the “connect with us” email response form.

We will make reasonable efforts to respond to your inquiry, but we may require follow-up or contact information to allow us to verify that you are the person authorized to view the information you are requesting. We may, in our discretion, refuse to allow you access to certain information if, in our view, to provide such access would jeopardize another person’s privacy; would violate any applicable federal, state, or foreign law, regulation, or directive; or would unreasonably burden this Site.

It is your responsibility to safeguard any usernames and passwords you use to access portions of this Site and to notify us if you ever suspect that these usernames or passwords have been compromised. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of this Site conducted via your username or password.

### Safeguarding Children's Privacy

This Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from such individuals. Should a child who we know to be under 13 years of age send us personal information without the verifiable consent of that child's parent or guardian, we will immediately delete such information from our databases.

### Governing Law Venue

This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms and Conditions of Use and as such the laws of the State of Michigan, U.S.A. will govern this Privacy Policy without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN MICHIGAN, U.S.A. IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
