Porsche reserves the right to change the Policy at any time without notice. Policy revisions are effective upon posting and apply only to data collected thereafter. You should periodically visit this page to review the then current terms. **Confidentiality**  
Porsche does not sell or provide personally identifying data to non-affiliate third parties for promotional purposes, but may collect and share aggregate website statistical information (such as sales, traffic patterns or related information) with third parties. No such shared statistics will contain any personally identifying user information. **Visitor Identification**

Porsche does not collect personally identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address and telephone number) through its website unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

Porsche may provide such companies with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to deliver the service, which may not be for any other purpose. You will not receive e-mails or mailings concerning Porsche or its products, services or promotions unless you specifically elect to receive such information. Although no system is currently 100% immune from external attack, Porsche has taken commercially reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorized access and improper use of your personal information.
