**How do we use cookies?**  
A cookie is a small text file stored on the visitor’s hard drive. We use cookies for the following reasons:

  * To indicate whether you are signed in as a registered user of the Web site.
  * To enhance your privacy and security while doing business with PGE. If you step away from your computer or don’t sign out, you will be signed out automatically after 10 idle minutes.
  * To ensure your Web experience will not be disrupted if a load-balancing server is down or busy.

Our cookies will expire 10 to 20 minutes after the visitor leaves the PGE Web site. The cookie file remains on the hard drive and will be renewed upon subsequent visits, but no information in the file will be reused, matched or associated with any other information. In addition, ForeSee Results, Inc., a firm hired to survey visitors on the PGE Web site, places a session-level cookie on survey respondents’ browsers to track how many pages a particular visitor has passed over. Session-level cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session. This technique ensures that a visitor has sufficiently browsed the site in order to adequately answer the survey and prevents anyone from getting a survey more than once in a single session.

The Web survey also adds a persistent cookie to track that a particular respondent has seen the PGE Web site survey, so that person won't be bothered with it again. No personal information is tracked with this persistent cookie, nor are visitors tracked once they have left the PGE Web site. 

PGE also uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, on selected pages on our Web site. The GIF files allow us, through a third-party service, to recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive that tracks traffic patterns and enrollment success rates. No personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, is gathered or shared through this process. We do not share the anonymous information gathered through this technology with third parties other than companies assisting us in improving our Web site or programs. If you use Internet Explorer version 6.0, you may be notified that this technology is in use on our site.

**Release of information**  
PGE has agreements with other local utility companies to share customer information for credit purposes only. We have established security procedures to ensure that information is being shared only with authorized utility representatives. 

Occasionally, we may hire third parties to act on our behalf for activities such as market research surveys, billing, technical support or contest entry processing. These parties will not be permitted to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing their specific services, and they are not permitted to disclose, transfer or sell personally identifiable information.

**Online Home Energy Analysis**  
PGE has contracted with Apogee Interactive, Inc. to provide our customers with online energy analysis. Apogee Interactive has agreed that they will not sell your online home energy analysis data to any third party. Your energy usage data, provided by PGE to Apogee Interactive to complete your online energy analysis, will be transmitted via an encrypted Security Socket Layer (SSL). 

Other than the ways mentioned above, we will not release personally identifiable information to third parties without permission from the customer, unless we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights or property, (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web site or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public.
