Keep you updated on any changes to your bookings | Again, this is part of our obligation to fulfil our contract with you.

#### If you have an accident while travelling with us

If you are involved in an accident on one of our ferries, or on our premises, we will ask you to complete an accident form. This will require you to provide us with contact information and details of your accident. We need to collect this information to comply with our legal requirements regarding the safety of our services, and should we need to follow-up with you in relation to the accident, or use the information in relation to a legal claim against us.

#### CCTV footage

For security purposes, we collect CCTV footage in our premises and ships, which will involve the collection of your image if you are located at or visit our premises or ships where we maintain CCTV systems.

#### A quick word about children

We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised child under the age of 16. We only collect information relating to children as part of a ferry booking where they are one of the passengers, and the ferry booking has been made by an adult, or if a child is involved in an accident whilst travelling with us.

#### Why do you do all of that?

We only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on the reason or reasons we collected and need to use your information.

Under EU and UK data protection laws in almost all cases the legal basis will be:

  * Because we need to use your information so that we can process your booking, fulfil your travel arrangements and otherwise perform the contract we have with you.
  * Because it is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information to operate and improve our business as a travel provider, and protect our business against fraudulent activity. Where we rely upon our legitimate interests to process your personal information, we have specified that fact in this Policy.
  * Because we need to use your personal information to comply with a legal obligation.
  * To protect the vital interests of you or another person.
  * Because you have consented to us using your information for a particular purpose. Where we rely upon your consent to process your personal information, we have specified that fact in this Policy (and that you have a right to withdraw that consent at any time).



#### Processing Data for Marketing Purposes

If you’ve booked with us or given us your contact details to receive marketing communications before 17 May 2018, it is in our legitimate interest to process your personal information to provide you, our customer, with information about our products and services. You can object to this processing at any time.

If you’ve booked with us or given us your contact details to receive marketing on or after 17 May 2018, we will only process this information for marketing purposes with your permission.

You can find more information on how to object or withdraw your permission to process for marketing purposes below, in the “Can I opt out” section.

#### How long do you keep it for?

The period for which we retain your personal information depends upon the reasons we collected it:

#### Marketing

If you’ve booked with us, and you have consented to us providing you with marketing materials, we’ll keep your details for marketing purposes for up to 5 years after your last interaction with us.

Once this period has elapsed, we’ll remove all of the personally identifiable information. This will leave an anonymised record that someone booked a ferry crossing, but we’ll no longer know who you are.

If you’ve not booked with us but you’ve signed up to receive marketing communications (via our website, for example), we’ll keep your details for up to 2 years after the last time you interacted with us. After this time, we’ll also delete your details.

#### Payment details

We will keep your payment details for a period of up to six (6) months following your payment to us. If, however, your booking is more than six (6) months after your payment to us, we will retain your payment information until you have travelled with us.

#### Booking information

Save as set out above in relation to the retention of your data for marketing purposes, we will only retain your booking information for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations. In most cases, this means storing this information for six years.

Once this period has elapsed, we’ll remove all of the personally identifiable information. This will leave an anonymised record that someone booked a ferry crossing, but we’ll no longer know who you are.

#### Customer Services information

We keep details of any contact you make with our Customer Care team for a period of 2 years after we collect it. This is to ensure that we can provide the best customer care to you should you travel with us in the future.

#### Information relating to accidents

If you have an accident while travelling with us, we will retain your information for a period of up to 7 years following the accident to ensure that we have this information so that we can respond to requests you may have about the accident, or should you wish to make a claim against us in relation to the accident.

#### How safe is my personal information?

We take all necessary steps to protect the personal information that you give us.

The personal information that you enter on our website while making a booking is encrypted via HTTPS. This is demonstrated by the “padlock” icon in the address bar of your web browser (ie. Google Chrome/Internet Explorer/Mozilla Firefox) when on these pages.

We store all data in secured environments with access controls to ensure that only people with a legitimate reason can access your data.

When we transfer personal data electronically (for example to a third party service provider), we do so in an encrypted form via a secure transfer method (ie. SFTP).

#### Who will be using it?

We never sell your personal information to any third parties for any reason.

We will share your data with selected third party service providers, agencies and subcontractors who do work on our behalf to provide services such as data storage, analysis and marketing services. Where this is necessary we will only pass over the information necessary to carry out the specific service (delivery of a marketing mailing, for example) and the third parties are under contract to keep your information safe and secure and not to disclose it to anyone or use it for their own marketing purposes.

When you make a booking with us, your payment will be processed by a third party payment processor who specialises in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions. If you have any questions regarding the processing of payment transactions, please contact us.

In addition, we also work in association with third party product providers to offer you a range of products and services (P&O Insurance and P&O Travel Money, for example). When you purchase one of those products, the relevant product provider will use the information you’ve given them to provide the purchased product or service and to carry out their obligations arising from any contracts you have entered into with them. In some cases, the third party product providers will be acting as the Data Controller of your information and will have their own privacy policies. These third party product providers will share your information with us which we will use in accordance with this privacy policy.

We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation in accordance with our legitimate interests, or if we’re under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers. However, we will take care to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

#### Do you transfer my data outside of the EU?

Some of our external third party service providers are based outside the European Union **(EU)** so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EU.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see [European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)
  * If the service provider is not in a country deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data transferred outside the EU an adequate level of protection. For further details, see [European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)
  * Alternatively, if the service provider is based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which has been approved by the European Commission as giving personal data an adequate level of protection. For further details, see [European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en)



Please contact us if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EU.

#### How can I update my details?

Obviously we want to make sure that our information is as accurate as possible. If the data we hold about you is incorrect or out-of-date, and you’d like us to make any changes, you can contact us by email on customer.services@poferries.com, by telephone on 01304 863000 or by writing to us at P&O Ferries, Freepost BRI, CT17 3BR.

We include unsubscribe links at the top and bottom of all marketing emails that we send. So if you’ve received a marketing email from us and would like it to be the last, simply click the link at the top of the email.

#### Subject Access Requests, Objecting to use of your information and Right to be Forgotten

You can request that we provide access to / copies of all information that we hold about you.

You also have the right to request that we stop using and/or delete your personal information.
