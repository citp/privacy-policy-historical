		<ul>
			<li>to comply with any law or comply with legal process served on us;</li>

	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="non-personally">Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>
		<p>We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Site to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. When you visit our Site, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Site will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Site to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Site or certain areas or features of our Site. A more detailed explanation of our cookie policy can be found <a href="http://www.pokeraffiliateworld.com/cookies-information.htm">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Site; the website you visit after this Site; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Your IP address can also be used for moderation purposes, in order to limit the creation of multiple accounts and SPAM prevention.</p>
		<p>When you use the Site, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make the Site better for our users.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Special Promotions Privacy Terms</b>
		<p>PAW may, from time to time, initiate certain bonus programs and other promotional activities (collectively, the "<b>Promotions</b>"), in connection with which certain additional personal information may be collected from our users. Specifically, the personal information that may be collected in connection with our Promotions includes a user's name, surname, room nickname (i.e. the nickname the user gives him/herself in connection with the specific Promotion), email address, and country of residence. In addition, in certain Promotions as well as in certain cases in which further verification procedures so require, a user may also be asked to provide a telephone number and a facial photograph together with the user's ID.</p>
		<p>PAW may disclose the personal information described above to such third parties with whom PAW partners in connection with the Promotions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</b>
		<p>PAW undertakes appropriate efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it collects about users of the Site and other than as specified in this Privacy Policy, it will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside PAW.</p>
		<p>You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your login credentials are confidential and you are obliged to keep your login credentials secret and confidential at all times and to take all efforts to protect their secrecy and confidentiality.</p>
		<p>Please be advised, however, that due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of user information may be compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="limits-confidentiality">Limits of Confidentiality</b>
		<p>Due to the legal, regulatory and security environment in which we operate, PAW may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose personally identifiable information of our users and we may not be permitted to inform you that we have done so. PAW will use reasonable endeavours to limit such disclosure where PAW believes in good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena, warrant or other legal process, or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce PAW’s rights. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your user identification information to third party agents of PAW or official government bodies as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us to legal liability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="receives">Who receives your information?</b>
		<p>In addition to legally required disclosures as explained in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose your personal information to our employees, employees of other companies in our corporate group, our agents and to third party service providers who use your personal information to provide services to us in respect of your being a user of PAW. All recipients of your personal information shall be bound by applicable data protection laws to keep your personal information private.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="rights">Your rights in relation to your information</b>
		<p>We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible. You can write to us at any time to review, change, obtain a copy of your information or have your details altered or corrected in accordance with your rights under applicable laws, and in such event we may require evidence of your identity. In order to contact us regarding your information please <a href="http://www.pokeraffiliateworld.com/contact.htm">contact us</a>. We may in certain circumstances levy a small charge to cover the cost of administration regarding any request made by you in this regard.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="links">Links</b>
		<p>The Site may contain links to third parties' websites. While we attempt to provide links to sites that value your privacy, we cannot be responsible for the content or privacy policies of such sites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of such third parties' websites prior to any use of such websites.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b id="opt-out">Opt-Out Options</b>
		<p>We and other members of our corporate group may occasionally send you emails with information on events and news or information regarding new services or in connection with customer support matters. If you no longer wish to receive our email newsletters, you can opt-out, at any time, by <a href="http://www.pokeraffiliateworld.com/contact.htm">contacting us</a> here requesting removal of your email address from any such mailing lists. If applicable, you may also opt-out from receiving marketing communications from us by following instructions on our email communications explaining how to unsubscribe from our email mailing lists. We will take appropriate steps to fulfil your request within reasonable time; however, it may take a few days or longer to process your request during which you may still receive marketing communications from us. We reserve the right to send you non-marketing notice about your account, even if you opt-out of all email notifications.</p>
		<p>If you decide to terminate your account with us, you may do so by <a href="http://www.pokeraffiliateworld.com/contact.htm">contacting us</a> here specifying your request and providing us with your PAW Username and email address with which you registered. If you terminate your account, your profile will be removed from the Site, however, deletion may not be immediate and we may continue keeping your personal information in our records for audits and other administrative purposes.</p>
