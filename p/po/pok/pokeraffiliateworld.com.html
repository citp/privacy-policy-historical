<p><b>Our Legal Obligations.</b> We will comply with the terms of the Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 (as may be amended or updated from time to time) (the “ <b>Act</b> ”) when processing your personal information. Your personal information may be also processed or transferred by us to other members of or our group of companies, our affiliates, our agents and third parties providing services to us, in jurisdictions outside of the Isle of Man and the European Economic Area. In this event we will comply with the terms of the Act which ensures that personal data is only transferred to such jurisdictions which comply with the various ‘adequacy’ requirements for data protection set out in the Act.</p>

<p><b>What do the Capitalised Terms Mean?</b> Unless we give them a specific meaning in this Privacy Policy, capitalised terms shall have the meaning given to them in our <a href="/terms&amp;conditions.htm">Terms and Conditions</a> which takes precedence over any conflicting provision of this Privacy Policy.</p>
