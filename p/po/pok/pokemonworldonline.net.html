<p>Your personal information and privacy are important to Pokémon World Online.

<p>This Privacy Policy is a part of our End-User License Agreement and Terms of Service Agreements, and by participating in any portion of the service you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities conducted within our services.

<h2>II How Personal Information May be Used</h2>
<p>Any Personal Information submitted to Pokémon World Online may be used by Pokemon World Online for a variety of reasons, within reasonable limitation.</p>
<p>This information may be used to identify rightful possession of an account in the event of a lost or stolen password. This information may be used to identify multiple accounts as falling under the possession of one individual. This information may be used to prevent those in possession of terminated accounts future access to the service. This information may be used to provide optional email updates from either our website or forums, at the sole discretion of you, the user. This information may be used to verify the status of a donation made to Pokemon World Online.</p>
<p>In the highly unlikely event that legal authorities request Pokemon World Online provide such Personal Information for use in any legal context, Pokémon World Online will be required to oblige the requests of such authorities.</p>
<p>This information may not and will not be shared with any third party source, with the exception of law enforcement officials as previously noted. This information may not and will not be sold to any third party source. This information may not and will not be gathered unwillingly or without the knowledge of its provider under any circumstance; all information collected by Pokémon World Online must be consented by its source.</p>

<p>The number of individuals who have access to any Personal Information collected by Pokémon World Online is limited to a very small number of people, and our staff is routinely updated and debriefed as our security practices develop and evolve. Staff will be limited in the type of Personal Information they can access depending on the access level the staff member has.</p>
<p>By participating in any portion of any service provided by Pokémon World Online, including forums and game, you acknowledge that "perfect security" does not exist on the internet and that Pokémon World Online will execute to the fullest extent of their power the best security and protection possible to ensure the integrity of your Personal Information.</p>
