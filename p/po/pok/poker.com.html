							At Poker.com, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. We have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit the Poker.com web site and online service (collectively, the "Service"), why we collect this information and how we use the collected information. This Privacy Policy is governed by our Terms and Conditions of Use posted at www.poker.com/terms.htm. This Privacy Policy does not govern other Websites that we maintain. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page.

We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with Poker.com. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to the Poker.com website. In addition, we may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support,, process your online transactions and maintain your online accounts. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services so that we can process your transactions, maintain your accounts, meet certain business requirements and provide you with promotional offers and information regarding Poker.com and our products and services. We use this Personal Information to process your transactions and support your use of the Service. Subject to clauses 3 &amp; 4 below.

Your Personal Information may also be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents for technical support and to process transactions you initiate on the Service and deliver the products and services you purchase. From time-to-time, we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). By accepting any contest prize or winnings from us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law.

						</p>
