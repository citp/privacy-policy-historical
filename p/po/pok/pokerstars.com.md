We and other members of our corporate Group may occasionally send you events and news information or information regarding new services and to provide you with customer support services. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter.

Where you fail to reimburse us for any chargebacks, denial or reversal of deposits you make, we may give details of your accounts and how you manage them to Credit Reference Agencies (CRA).  The CRA will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations and  records will remain on the CRA file for 6 years after the date of the chargeback, denial or reversal of payment. The information will be used by the CRA to prevent crime, fraud, money laundering, verifying your identity if you, your partner, other members of your household, your business or financial associates apply for other facilities, monitoring the operation of accounts you may hold, making decisions for credit, credit related or other facilities, trace your whereabouts, recover debts that you owe, statistical analysis and system testing.

We will only use your name in publicity materials with your consent.

The name you register with us must be your own name. In addition, it is very important that you complete the account details with valid information, since it will be used in the course of validating financial transactions and the other aforementioned purposes. You are required to advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information.

Users are able to change account details by selecting an account option in the downloaded software.
