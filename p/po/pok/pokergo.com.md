Each Service Provider is expected to use reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Third-Party Providers are prohibited from using Personal Data other than as specified by Poker Central.

_Joint Services_

We may provide services jointly with other companies. In some cases, to facilitate such services, it may be necessary to share your Personal Data with such other companies.

You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our reasonable judgment, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.
