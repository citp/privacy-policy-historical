<h1 class="faqheadline">Privacy and Cookie Policy</h1>
<p>The Privacy and Cookie Policy below (together the <span class="bold">"Privacy Policy"</span>) is an
important document, which you (<span class="bold">"you"</span>
or
<span class="bold">"user"</span>) should read carefully.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy has been put together by pokersites.com
(the<span class="bold">"Company"</span>, <span class="bold">"we"</span>
or <span class="bold">"us"</span>) as a way of acquainting our
users with our methods of gathering and processing anonymized
data through our website (the <span class="bold">"Website"</span>), and the legal and
ethical reasons for which we gather and process such data.</p>
<img src="/imgs/logo.png" alt="pokersites.com logo" class="corner_icon">
<p>On the Website you can find information about gaming web pages
and general online gaming updates. There may also be links and
advertisements for third party-websites in the same industry
which do not belong to the Company (these and the Website will
hereafter be jointly referred to as: the "Services"). Websites
which you access by following these links and advertisements
have their own distinct privacy and cookie policies. Before you
submit any personal data to these websites, you should read
their privacy policies carefully.</p>
<p>Your continued access of the Website is taken to constitute your
acknowledgement and consent to our Privacy Policy and the
methods it describes for gathering and storing any anonymized
information.</p>
<h2>Types of information collected</h2>
<h3>Non-personal information</h3>
<p>Throughout your use of our Services, information may be
collected that is un-identified and non-identifiable, and will
be referred to as <span class="bold">"non-personal
information"</span> in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information in this category may include data sent out by your
internet-enabled device, such as your IP address and other
information that can distinguish you from other users, and
comprehensive information about your website access, including
the type and version of your browser and your operating system,
the language in which you browse the Website, and your preferred
browsing times when it comes to our Website and the
Services.</p>
<p>Other information we gather from you may include the way in which
you browse the Website and use our Services, so that we can
streamline and design the Website to suit your needs and
preferences.</p>
<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>Cookies are a way of distinguishing one user from another, so
that you can be given a more personalised experience by our
Website. Cookies also help the Company increase the general
security and user-friendliness of the Website.</p>
<p>Every time a user accesses a website, the website responds by
creating and sending them a temporary computer file called a
'cookie', which is assigned to this specific user and allows the
website to keep track of different users and their particular
preferences. The job of cookies is to make the communication
between users and the Services smoother, simpler and more
satisfactory on repeat visits.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the different types of cookies that our
Website uses, including their various purposes:</p>
<ul class="bullets-plain">
<li><span class="bold">'Session cookies'</span> – these are
temporary
cookies which are created by the Website each time you
access the website and are then automatically deleted once
you close your browser. If you disable session cookies, then
the performance of the Website will decline, because they
are needed for the smooth running of the Website.
</li>
<li><span class="bold">'Persistent cookies'</span> – these
cookies
are used by our third-party service providers, such as web
analytics companies who analyse the ways in which our users
engage with a website. Persistent cookies can be kept for up
to a year by the relevant companies, in accordance with
their privacy policies. Persistent cookies come in three
categories:
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Analytical/performance cookies</span>
–
these are cookies which collect anonymous data about a
website's visitors in order to compile data on the ways
in which users access and navigate a website. This data
helps the Company reorganise the Website and provide the
Services which users are actually interested in.
</li>
<li><span class="bold">Functionality cookies</span> – these
cookies help the Company distinguish you from other
users, in order to provide you with a better, more
optimized experience the next time you visit our
Website; and
</li>
<li><span class="bold">Targeting cookies</span> – these
cookies
keep a record of the links you click on within our
Website, so that we can provide you with external links
that match your needs.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In using our Website you provide us with your consent that you
have understood and accepted our Cookie Policy. It is important
to note that cookies gather only non-personal information, which
cannot be used to identify users personally.</p>
<p>You are provided with the option to refuse the creation of
cookies for you by the Services, and you can do this by
accessing your internet browser's settings and turning off its
acceptance of some or all cookies. Doing this may lower the
general performance of the Website and its related third-party
services, since cookies help us ensure that our level of service
matches your expectations.</p>
<h2>Third-party links</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is compiled by the staff of pokersites.com
and is only applicable to information that you submit to our
Website. If you click on any links on the Website which lead you
to third-party websites, the data that you share there will be
covered by the relevant privacy policies of the third-party
websites. Third-party affiliates are independent entities, not
controlled by the Company, and they have separate established
processes for handling user information. The Website does not
accept any liability for the privacy controls of third-party
websites. By accessing third-party websites, you acknowledge
this and agree to bear any and all risks that may arise from
sharing information on these websites.</p>
<p>Any information that users share with third-party websites that
are hyperlinked to the Website will not be covered by this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Using user information</h2>
<p>Beyond the reasons listed above for collecting data related to
our users, we may also use that data to do the following:</p>
<ul class="bullets-plain">
<li>Protect the structural integrity of the Website;</li>
<li>Assess how interesting and important our content is to our
users;
</li>
<li>Analyse data with the purpose of improving and
individualizing the Services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also handle information that we have gathered when
complying with any relevant legal requirements, or in order to
comply with any court requests or requests by equivalent legal
entities.</p>
<h2>Sharing your information</h2>
<p>Information that has been gathered from you may be shared with
third parties for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="bullets-plain">
<li><span class="bold">Service providers and related
entities</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Company may share your data to affiliated third party
businesses or other trusted business partners so that they can
fulfil their data-processing function for the Website.
Third-party affiliates may engage in researching, diagnosing or
analysing the data and the technology through which it has been
received.</p>
<ul class="bullets-plain">
<li><span class="bold">Other disclosures</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Anonymized data gathered from users may also be shared with
business advisers, auditors and any potential buyers or
investors in the Company. Such data may also be shared with our
affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>
<p>If the Company becomes involved in a major corporate transaction,
such as selling a significant portion of the business, buying a
business or asset, or a company merger, such data may be shared
with the potential buyer or seller of the aforementioned assets
or business.</p>
<p>In addition, the Company may also share such data if sharing it
is considered reasonably necessary or helpful when complying
with any legal obligation, applicable law or government request;
when upholding intellectual property or other legal rights; when
taking action against unlawful activity, alleged fraud or
security breaches; when enforcing the Company's internal
policies; when effecting the Company's right to contest a legal
claim; and when ensuring the security and rights of the user,
the Company or any related third party.</p>
<h2>Retention of user information</h2>
<p>Anonymized data that is gathered from users is handled and stored
by the Company only for the length of time that is specified in
the Company's policies and stipulated by gaming and other
relevant law requirements. Through your use of the Website you
give your informed consent to this Privacy Policy and the data
handling procedures it outlines. It is the Company's
responsibility to ensure the security of information according
to the procedures described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Securing and transferring your information</h2>
<p>The Company takes the security of both the Services and our data
very seriously. Therefore, the Company aims to provide the
highest available levels of security as a way of preventing
unlawful access to Company and its information. Regrettably, the
transmission of data over the internet can never be 100% secure,
so the Company cannot guarantee that the security of our data
will never be breached. The Company can only make sure that all
reasonable effort is constantly made by the Company to safeguard
all data in its possession. Any online data transfers are made
at your own risk.</p>
<p>The Company has offices in many different countries, which means
that user data may happen to be transmitted through and to
countries that are under laws that are different from those in
the European Union (<span class="bold">"EU"</span>). Despite the
fact that in such countries, the local data protection laws may
not be as extensive as those laws and regulations followed by
the countries in the EU, the Company will make all reasonable
effort to protect data following the same safety procedures as
within the EU. When you use the Services, you give your informed
consent to the transfer of information as per the processes
detailed in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<h2>Minors</h2>
<p>The Company stresses that individuals below the age of 18 are
legally forbidden from using the Services. The Services have
been created with users above the age of 18 in mind, and they
are not to be accessed by minors.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy updates</h2>
<p>From time to time this Privacy Policy will be revised to reflect
Company and legal changes at the Company's sole discretion. The
Website will always present the latest version of the Privacy
Policy. We strongly recommend that you read this Privacy Policy
closely and review it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Any further access of our Website will be taken as the user's
informed consent and acknowledgement of these changes.</p>
<h2>Information about us</h2>
<p>Users who would like to submit any queries about the Website,
the third-party services offered, or about the data that is
gathered by the Services about users and their movements on the
Website, can contact us using <a href="/about">the contact form</a>.</p>
