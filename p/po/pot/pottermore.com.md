# Pottermore: Privacy and Cookies Policy ("Privacy Policy")

This Privacy Policy contains 15 sections. You can view each section by selecting the links below:

### 1 Introduction

1.1 Welcome to Pottermore, the digital home of the Harry Potter books (“Pottermore”). Pottermore includes an interactive online platform known as “Pottermore.com”, which is described in more detail in our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/terms) (“Terms”), as well as an online eBook and digital audio book shop known as the “Pottermore Shop”. Pottermore is owned by Pottermore Limited (referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” as appropriate, a company established in England and Wales). Pottermore is currently available through the website at [http://www.pottermore.com](http://www.pottermore.com/). We may also make Pottermore or other versions of it available through a number of digital channels or devices. 

1.2 This Privacy Policy describes how we deal with personal information and privacy issues. For the purpose of the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Pottermore Limited. Please see our [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms) and our [About Pottermore](https://web.archive.org/en/about) page for more information about Pottermore Limited and the basis upon which we provide Pottermore. Some of the capitalised words used in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms.

1.3 We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of users of Pottermore and strive to make Pottermore a fun, safe and secure experience for all users. We encourage all users to act responsibly and with care when it comes to their personal information and that of others. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how the information you provide to us is used and protected. If you have any queries or concerns regarding these practices, please refer to our [Help](https://www.pottermore.com/en/help) pages in the first instance. 

1.4 Please note that by visiting and using Pottermore or consenting for your child to do the same, you are agreeing to the use of your or your child’s personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. For further information on how we use your child’s personal information and the measures we adopt to safeguard their privacy, please see our [Child Safety Policy](https://web.archive.org/en/child-safety).

### 2 Changes to our privacy policy

2.1 We may make any change to this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes we will notify you by sending you an email to the last email address that you provided to us and/or by posting a copy of the changes on Pottermore. Subject to paragraph 2.2, any changes will take effect seven (7) days after the date of our email or the date we post the modified terms on Pottermore, whichever is earlier. If you continue to make use of Pottermore after that period expires you are confirming that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. As noted in our [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms), you are responsible for keeping your account information up to date, including your/your parent or guardian’s email address. If the email address to which we send notification to you under this clause is no longer valid but you have failed to notify us of this, the sending of our email (notifying you of any changes to the Terms) will be deemed, nonetheless, to be effective notice of the modified Privacy Policy.

2.2 If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use and/or share personal information, we will give you prominent notice of these changes and offer you a choice about whether the changes should apply to any personal information that we previously collected from you. If we make material changes to how we collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13, we will notify parents or guardians by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of their child’s personal information.

### 4 How else may we use your personal information?

4.1 We may use your personal information to investigate a complaint made by another user or any potential breach of Pottermore’s [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms) and to prevent and detect criminal activity, fraud and misuse of, or damage to, Pottermore or the services made available through it and to take appropriate legal action against those responsible. 

### 5 Information sharing and disclosure

5.1 We do not sell or rent your personal information.

5.2 We may share your personal information with authorised third parties for the purpose of operating, managing and administering the Accounts and services provided to you through Pottermore. Such third parties include providers of hosting, ecommerce fulfilment, moderation and payment and support services. We may further share and disclose this information with other third parties including our commercial partners from time to time (“Partners”) in order to better integrate their services with Pottermore. Before we share or disclose any of your personal information with our Partners (for example, by linking your account on Pottermore with your account on a Partner’s service) we will always first ask you for your permission to do so. 

5.3 If you are under the age of 16, we will use any personal information we collect from you for internal purposes only.

5.4 We do not send any personal information that we collect about you on Pottermore to any social networking sites that you link to your Pottermore Account nor do we share that information with such sites. We do not collect any personal information about you from those sites. We may, however, disclose personal information about you to the following, for the express purposes set out below:

If you create a Pottermore Account or Pottermore Shop Account:

§ to our employees, agents and authorised third party providers for them to administer any accounts or services provided to you through Pottermore, for example the sending of e-alerts on our behalf.

§ if you tick the relevant box to permit communications from our Partners, to those partners, their employees and agents for them to send you communications regarding goods and services they offer.

Transfer of business:

§ if there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of Pottermore Limited or any of its assets, we may have to disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner.

### 6 Your payment details

6.1 You may choose to store your credit or debit card details within your Pottermore Shop Account to use when making future purchases. We will never send you an email containing your full credit or debit card number and we will never publicly disclose your payment details, whether on Pottermore or elsewhere. If you appear to have received an email from us, or seen a Pottermore page, that displays your full credit or debit card number or otherwise discloses your payment details, this is not genuine – a third party may be attempting to steal your information. Please see paragraph 10 for further information on how we protect the payment information we hold for you on Pottermore.

### 7 Other types of information we collect and use

7.1 We aim to provide a number of features on Pottermore that help provide a more personalised and enhanced experience to our users. To achieve this, we may collect and use a limited amount of non-personal information from you. In addition, we may ask you about which books and films in the Harry Potter series you have enjoyed. We will never publicly disclose any such information on Pottermore without obtaining your permission.

7.2 We also collect aggregated statistics data about visitors to Pottermore and traffic patterns (and share it with third parties such as our Partners). Just to be clear, this information does not identify you in any personal capacity; it simply gives generalised information about the users of Pottermore.

7.3 We also use watermarking technology to help us combat hacking, piracy and the unauthorised use of books sold through the Pottermore Shop. This involves the use of code numbers to help us to identify individual copies of a book. We may use such watermarking technology to identify items purchased through your Pottermore Shop Account to help us investigate and protect against hacking, piracy, unauthorised use and any other behaviour that may be in breach of our Terms or applicable laws.

### 8 Cookies and similar technologies

8.1 While on Pottermore, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using Pottermore to analyse performance and usage of Pottermore. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to Pottermore, your IP address and the pages you visit while on Pottermore. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. 

8.2 Like many online services we use a feature called a “cookie”, which is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device’s hard drive. References to cookies also include other means of automatically accessing or storing information on your device. Cookies enable us to identify your device when you have logged in. We use cookies that are strictly necessary for the functioning of Pottermore. For example, we use ‘session cookies’ to keep track of your internet session whilst on the Pottermore Shop which, for instance, allows us to remember the items you add to your list of intended purchases in your shopping basket.

You can find out more about cookies at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

Without these strictly necessary cookies the online services that you have asked for cannot be provided. We also use cookies (and other automatically tracked information) to help you move around and enjoy the interactive features on Pottermore.com more easily and to remember settings to improve your visit (at your request) such as your site language preferences or whether you want to be signed in automatically next time you visit. We also use cookies to help improve the performance of Pottermore and to provide you with a better user experience. We use ‘analytics cookies’ (such as Google Analytics cookies) to keep track of our users’ browsing activity whilst on Pottermore. The information that we collect through such analytics cookies is aggregated and anonymous and is only used to help us improve how our website works and to understand what interests our users by showing us, for example, which pages you visit.

The information does not identify you as an individual user. If you have come to Pottermore through one of our Partners, we may use an ‘affiliate cookie’ to help us recognise which Partner helped you to find us. We also use online behavioural advertising cookies to work out what advertising might be most relevant to you based on the areas you look at on our site. These cookies look at your IP address to provide information about where you are located. We also allow third party marketing, analytics and other service providers to collect information about your browsing activities and to provide tailored advertising. Third-party targeted advertising cookies collect information about your browsing activity across multiple websites and online services in order to provide you with relevant advertisements on our websites and online services and the websites and online services of third parties. Ad networks may share this information with the advertisers using their network. The information collected using these cookies does not identify you personally. Please be aware that third parties may use their own cookie tags when you click on a link on our website and that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy and cookie compliance policies.

We use cookies to give you the very best experience on Pottermore and to allow you to make use of all the site features. If you visit Pottermore without changing your cookie settings the cookies we use will be sent to your device. By continuing to use Pottermore you are providing your consent for us to use cookies in these ways but you can disable any of these cookies at any time if you wish (as set out below). Please also see our Help pages for guidance on how to do so. Please note, if you disable certain cookies, this may limit your use of Pottermore.com and the Pottermore Shop. Disabling analytics cookies and affiliate cookies will not limit your use of the sites.   


8.3 You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, or you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it.

You can check whether these settings are currently enabled on your computer - or find out how to change your current settings - here:

Unless you do this, cookies will be issued when you use our site, but you can disable them via your browser at any time. If you do not accept cookies or decide to disable them you will still be able to access and use the site but you will lose some features and functionality. For example, you won’t be able to remain signed-in if you disable cookies. 

If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this by going to the help menu within your internet browser.

You are advised to read the privacy policy of external sites before disclosing any personal information.

### 9 Links

9.1 Pottermore contains links posted by us to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Read the [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms) for further information on these links. In particular, you will see in paragraph 5.5 of the Terms that users are not permitted to distribute or post any links including links to websites, files or links that open or run programs. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.

### 10 How do we protect personal information?

10.1 As required by UK Data Protection laws, we follow strict security procedures in relation to the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us in order to protect against unauthorised access. In particular, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt all your passwords and check-out pages. SSL encrypts the information you provide as it travels through the internet. Encryption creates millions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the website, so your password or information cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet. Despite using this technology, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you disclose to us. You accept the inherent risks of providing information and dealing online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security that is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

11.3 You can also edit your settings as described above in 11.2 to update your personal details held by us and to change your:

13.5 Your personal information and activity history on Pottermore may persist in our backups after we have deleted your Account(s) but will not be available to other users on Pottermore.

14.6 You should be aware that the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory authorities of countries outside the EEA, in addition to those within the EEA, may be able to obtain access to or disclosure of your personal information through the laws of their respective countries.
