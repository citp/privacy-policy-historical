# Privacy Policy | SUNY Potsdam

### Website Privacy

**Privacy Protection**  
At SUNY Potsdam, we are committed both to protecting individuals' privacy and to allowing individuals and businesses to interact more easily with SUNY Potsdam. We recognize that visitors must be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit an official SUNY Potsdam website. Visitors can travel through most of an official SUNY Potsdam website without offering any information about themselves. Sometimes SUNY Potsdam does need information to provide services, often at the request of visitors, and this policy explains our online information practices.

SUNY Potsdam does not collect any personal information about visitors unless they provide that information voluntarily by sending an email, completing one of several online forms, or completing an online transaction.

This policy is consistent with the provisions of the [NYS Internet Security and Privacy Act](http://www.oft.state.ny.us/ecommerce/internet_security_privacy.htm), the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law.

**Information Collected Automatically When You Visit an Official SUNY Potsdam Website**  
When you visit an official SUNY Potsdam website, SUNY Potsdam automatically collects and stores the following information about your visit:

  * The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that accessed our website
  * The type of browser, its version and the operating system on which that browser is running
  * The web page from which the user's computer accessed the current web page and the web page at which the user entered an official SUNY Potsdam website
  * The date and time of the user's request
  * The pages that were visited and the amount of time spent at an official SUNY Potsdam website

  * Search engines that brought users to an official SUNY Potsdam web site and the text search strings that allowed users to find an official SUNY Potsdam website
  * Downloads the user requested (e.g., .pdf and .mov files) from an official SUNY Potsdam website



None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute personal information by the NYS Internet Privacy and Security Act. The information that is collected automatically is used to improve the content of official SUNY Potsdam websites and to help SUNY Potsdam understand how users are interacting with its web sites. This information is collected for statistical analysis and to determine what information is of most and least interest to our users. The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and SUNY Potsdam does not sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from an official SUNY Potsdam web site for commercial marketing purposes.

**Information Collected When You Email an Official SUNY Potsdam Website or Complete a Transaction**  
During your visit to an official SUNY Potsdam website, you may send an email to SUNY Potsdam. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats attached to or included in the message. Your email address and the information included in your message will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this web site, or to forward your message to another SUNY Potsdam employee for appropriate action. Your e-mail address is not collected for commercial purposes and SUNY Potsdam does not sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial purposes.

During your visit to an official SUNY Potsdam website, you may complete a transaction such as a request to establish an internship, an update of your alumni information, or a gift to the College. The information collected by SUNY Potsdam, including personal information volunteered by you in completing the transaction, is used by SUNY Potsdam to operate our programs and may be disclosed by SUNY Potsdam for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in which the information was submitted.

SUNY Potsdam does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 14 or create profiles of children under the age of 14. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in an email will be treated as though it were submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. We encourage parents and adult family to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.

**Disclosure of Information Collected through an Official SUNY Potsdam Website**
