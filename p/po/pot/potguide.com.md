  2. ### Links to Other Websites

Our site has links to the sites, content, and services of other businesses, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, and other third parties.

You can always ask us to delete information in our possession, but we cannot force anyone else to erase your information. Please be aware that you publish such information at your own risk.

Ours is a small business, but when we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up as soon as practicable. We will work with relevant regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints or concerns that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
