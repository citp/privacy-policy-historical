## Use of Cookies

Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Pondesk.com pages, or register with Pondesk.com site or services, a cookie helps Pondesk.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Pondesk.com Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Pondesk.com features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Pondesk.com services or Web sites you visit.

## Security of your Personal Information
