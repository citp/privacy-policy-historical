Most ofour websites allow visitors to subscribe to our publications online, and some sites also offer areaswhere you may purchase items online. We offer online and offline subscribers a "bill me"option if they do not wish to use a credit card, but visitors should check online stores to see ifother payment options are permitted for online store purchases apart from credit cards.

Information Collected Automatically  
We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referringwebsite address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our websites. In addition, we usecookies to track usage patterns at our site and to control the display of ads, as well as to offerother functionalities (such as screening for age, helping to track items in your shopping basket atsites which offer online shopping opportunities, and "recognizing" you to speed up your log-inwhen you visit our sites).

We donot include any personally identifiable information of our users in these reports.

A user may, at any time,opt out of receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate andadminister our products and services, fulfill customer requests, like subscription and otherorders, respond to any problems that may arise, such as magazine delivery failures, difficulties innavigating our sites or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determinewhat products and services are most popular with users.

We allow users of our website to send articles or links by email to other parties who may beinterested in them. We do not retain any email addresses (unless you are a member who alreadyhas voluntarily provided your email address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles orlinks after they are sent, and do not share "send a friend" e-mail addresses with third parties.Of course, we use personal information to allow you to subscribe online or to make productpurchases at certain of our websites. Rest assured that we and our technical and fulfillmentagents and consultants follow careful procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection withyour transactions.

HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?  
Personal information is available to Primedia and its technical and fulfillment agents andconsultants who make this site and our publications, products and services available to you.Anonymous information is available to our advertisers, sponsors and promotional and businesspartners. We share your personal information with third parties only as described below.Primedia and Its Agents. Primedia may access both anonymous, aggregate demographic dataand any personal information you provide for internal marketing purposes, including sendingyou notices of subscription renewal deadlines, new publications, services or products we offerlikely to be of interest, and filling subscription and other orders. To facilitate subscriptions andorders, Primedia will cache your order information, and create an authorization with a merchantaccount (i.e., your credit card company). There are many companies who may be required toassist Primedia in making its publications, products and web sites available to you. Web hostfirms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, and fulfillment firms, includingfirms assisting us in offering contests and promotions, may have access to personally identifiableinformation in the course of making our products and services available. All companies workingfor Primedia must comply with our information collection, use and disclosure policies, and arenot permitted to sell your information to third parties or to use it except as authorized by us andyou, or as permitted or required by law.

Participating Vendors. Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online fromspecial participating vendors. On sites with online purchase opportunities for products andmerchandise, we will also give participating manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers or distributorsthe order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from aparticipating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order.Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products andofferings that they provide. Primedia is not responsible for their privacy policies, and urges youto inquire about their information practices. In addition, all vendors will receive the sameanonymous, aggregate data that our advertisers do.

Credit Card Companies. As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevantinformation about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost. Primediawill not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company.

Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners. We share anonymous,aggregate demographic information (such as gender, age, income, hobbies, interests, etc.), andanonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers,sponsors, promotional and business partners, and with participating vendors at sites offeringonline sales opportunities. No personally identifiable information is disclosed to any of thesethird parties in providing these reports. Credit card numbers, bank account numbers, andpasswords are not shared with advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners, and are only sharedwith specific vendors with whom you place an online order.

Offline and online contact information is handled differently. As is customary in thepublications business, offline contact information is shared with third parties who may send youoffers or information about their products or services. You must opt-out if you do not wish toreceive information from us or third parties by mail.

Your e-mail address is not shared with third parties unless you opt-in to receivinginformation from third parties. In other words, we may extend e-mail offers to users orsubscribers on behalf of our business partners about a particular product or service that may be ofinterest to you, but only if you have indicated that you would like to receive those offers. If youwish to receive such offers, we do not share or disclose your name or e-mail address to thosebusiness partners, but will send you the information or offers on their behalf. As result, althoughPrimedia may receive a fee from our business partners for this service, Primedia sends all theoffers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course,you may opt out of receiving those offers at any time.

Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers from third partiesnot affiliated with Primedia. If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with yourconsent, your contact information to the third party. At our websites, visitors will also haveopportunities to sign up directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter contests orsweepstakes, receive e-mail updates, or to receive information directly from them. Third partyvendors and advertisers will also use technical and other consultants. We urge visitors tocarefully review the privacy policies of these firms. Primedia is not responsible for the privacypolicies and procedures of any third party.

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, onlinein any community area (whether through PrimediaÂ’s websites or any other service availableonline), that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat,forums, bulletin boards or message boards, or if you post personal information online (such asyour e-mail address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Primedia has no controlover this use of your personal information.
