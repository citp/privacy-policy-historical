IV. The Google Analytics features Power Poetry has implemented is based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).

Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCjnLIRO_qykNCRIpCzO72Yw_vwH6H-aG6QU06CCG609PSlGKDeR7pkJ30frrmxc0XuM3AbFoa6DjMzJ6ivXcG2yjMsFZeyMQu8lugQ-DFtCIpyXxsPPkDCrEYOMDUhCuMdX9D9_5bwGxksPpHHZAGU3rea0DqZvKFWsBR57EUQzrGfR90QW9hNkTeVOkegHWzG5zeIxkT2z63ddiKg1k1kkdWU5Fw).

Power Poetry will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless you have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.
