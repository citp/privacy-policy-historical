		<p>We at ConeXware, Inc. are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.</p>
		<p>By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBB<em>OnLine</em>® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org" target="_blank">bbbonline.org</a>.</p>
		<p>ConeXware has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
		<p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit ConeXware's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.</p>
		<p>ConeXware strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, ConeXware intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>

		<h1>Data Collection</h1>
		<p>ConeXware collects Personal Information when you place an order for one of our products, request support from ConeXware, sign up for a newsletter, or submit a PowerArchiver skin.</p>
		<p>When you place an order for one of our products, ConeXware collects Personal Information as required to complete your order. This data includes your name, address, phone number, IP address and credit card details, depending on the payment method selected.</p>
		<p>ConeXware sometimes collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a Web site.

		<li>We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of ConeXware, its users or the public.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the event of a transfer of ownership of ConeXware, Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

		<h1>Choice</h1>
		<p>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to ConeXware. The notice we intend to provide where ConeXware collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice.
