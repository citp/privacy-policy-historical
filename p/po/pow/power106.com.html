<span class="mini">General
KPWR-FM (POWER 106) and its affiliates respect your privacy and
believe the best way to serve you on the Internet is with honesty,
accountability and adherence to legal standards. We are sensitive
to the issue of privacy and have structured our online activities
to maximize your control over the disclosure of your own personally
identifiable information. This Privacy Policy supplements our general
Terms of Use, which we also urge you to read. By using our Web site
(the "Site"), you agree to be bound by the terms of this
Privacy Policy and by the Terms of Use. We may change this Privacy
Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Site, and your continued
use of the Site indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly,
we urge you to frequently review this Privacy Policy, and, if you
do not agree to the terms of this or any revised policy, please
exit the Site immediately. </span>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">Privacy
of Children </span><br>
KPWR-FM encourages parents and guardians to be aware of and participate
in their children's online activities. We strictly adhere to the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly
register or otherwise collect personally identifiable information
from any child under the age of 13 without the prior verifiable
consent of that person?s parent or guardian.</p>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">What Information is Collected</span><br>
KPWR-FM may collect two types of information about you: personally
identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone
number and e-mail address) and aggregate information that is anonymous
(such as your IP address - a number used to identify your computer
when you are on the Internet - or the type of browser you are
using). <br>
<br>
<span class="header">Personally Identifiable Information:</span>
You may be required to register or otherwise voluntarily provide
personally identifiable information to have access to some features
of the Site. You always may choose not to provide the personally
identifiable information, but this may lead to decreased functionality
of the Site for you and our inability to provide you with certain
products or services. We also may request you to voluntarily provide
personally identifiable information that is not required to access
features of our site. This information enables KPWR-FM to make
general improvements to the Site and better serve your specific
interests.</p>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">Aggregate Information:</span>
KPWR-FM may transparently collect aggregate information through
the use of cookies or by other means. We use this information
to assess general usage patterns, administer and make improvements
to the Site and collect demographic information useful in some
way to KPWR-FM and our business partners. We hope that by using
Aggregate Information, we can update the Site to make it more
useful to you and other users. We, and our business partners,
reserve the right to use, maintain, update, disclose and/or sell
Aggregate Information.</p>
<p class="mini"> <span class="header">What We Will and Will Not
Do With the Information You Provide</span><br>
KPWR-FM uses information generally to compile statistical data,
keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive
experience.</p>
<p class="mini">We may use your information specifically for the
following purposes: to provide easy access every time you return
to the site without requiring re-entry of registration information;
to keep you informed about products and services in which you
may have interest; to complete business transactions; to contact
you as part of a promotion; to allow you to make a posting on
the Site; to administer individual accounts; to provide customer
support; to meet legal requirements; to provide Internet security;
and/or to analyze the collected information. Also, in the event
that we are involved in a sale of a substantial portion of our
business assets, customer information may be among the transferred
assets.</p>
<p class="mini">KPWR-FM works closely with our business partners
and certain other third parties who may perform functions on our
behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing promotional materials
to our users, sending e-mail, managing data, processing credit
card payments or providing customer service. They have access
to your personally identifiable information only to the extent
necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any
other purpose. Further, these business partners and other third
parties may from time to time wish to extend special offers to
you on their own behalf. We may use your personally identifiable
information to assist our business partners in offering you these
products, services and information and may act as an intermediary
(for instance, sending you e-mail on their behalf).</p>
<p class="mini">Other than for the specific purposes set forth in
this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personally identifiable
information to any third parties unless we obtain your prior consent
or are legally compelled to do so. In addition, we will not contact
you without your permission except as specified above or in connection
with the registration process. On the Site, you will be given
the opportunity to opt out of receiving e-mails or other information
from KPWR-FM. If you have questions about how your personally
identifiable information is used, please contact us. </p>
<p class="mini">Third Party Advertising We use third-party advertising
companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies
may use information (not including your name, address, email address
or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites
in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites
about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you
would like more information about this practice and to know your
choices about not having this information used by these companies,
click here. </p>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">Cookies</span><br>
When you visit the Site, we or a third-party advertiser may store
or recognize some information on your computer in the form of
a "cookie" or similar file that can help us in many
ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor our site to better
match your interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers
or other software, you can erase cookies from your computer hard
drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie
is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen
to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, functionality
of the Site may be severely limited, and you may not be able to
take advantage of many of the Site's best features. </p>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">About Our Forums </span><br>
The Site features forums (such as message boards and chat rooms),
which enable our users to communicate with each other. We do not
moderate and are not responsible for the content which you or
any user posts on any forum on the Site. All personally identifiable
information you post in a forum may be viewed, collected and used
by any visitor to the Site and is beyond our control. Therefore,
KPWR-FM strongly recommends that you do not post on any forum
private information about yourself or other individuals. </p>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">Linking to Our Business Affiliates'
and Third Party Web Sites </span><br>
The Site contains links to sites operated by our business partners
and other third parties. Once you leave the Site, you may or may
not see a new URL in the location bar. Please review the linked
site?s privacy policies, and if you do not agree to be bound by
the terms of the policies governing that site, terminate your
visit to that site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies
and practices of the sites operated by our business partners or
other third parties. </p>
<p class="mini"><span class="header">How Secure is Your Information</span>
<br>
Any unauthorized use of the Site may result in criminal and/or
civil prosecution. We have policies and procedures in place to
protect the privacy and confidentiality of your information that
we collect and maintain. All personally identifiable information
is stored on our secured servers, behind a firewall at a data
center with access to data strictly controlled. To help ensure
the privacy of your information, we urge you not to share your
user name and password with anyone and recommend that you change
your password frequently and store it in a safe place. If you
are asked to create a user name or password, please select words
that do not personally identify you. </p>
<p class="mini">Our site offers "auto login" which allows
users to enter member areas of our site without re-entering password
information. You may want to disable auto login on your "Set
Up" page if you are not the only person using your computer.
