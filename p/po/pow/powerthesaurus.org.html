                recorded, and we may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information,
                advertising, and features. Some of these services require us to associate location data with your device

                Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or
                mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each
                subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. A pixel tag (also called a web
                beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an
                online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used
                for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users
                navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors. Some
                ad companies and game developers use “flash cookies” for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
                We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.

                Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to

                pages efficiently, remember your preferences, track your use of the Services and generally improve your
                experience. Ad companies we work with place cookies on your computer to track your activities across
                various sites so that they can display ads on our Sites and third party websites that are more relevant
                to you and your interests.

                Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are
                ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted
                automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they
                survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you
                open your browser and browse the Internet again.

                The types of cookies used by us and our partners in connection with the Services can be classified into
                one of the 4 categories below. We’ve set out some further information about each category, and the
                purposes of the cookies we and third parties set below:
            </p><ol><li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong>.
                    These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features,
                    such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies some services cannot be
                    provided.
                </li><li><strong>Functional cookies</strong>.
                    These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or
                    the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used
                    to remember changes you have made to sorting, text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you
                    can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video
                    or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot
                    track your browsing activity on other websites.
                </li><li><strong>Performance cookies</strong>.
                    These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages
                    visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t
                    collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated
                    and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.
                </li><li><strong>Tracking cookies</strong>.
                    These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited, the material you have
                    downloaded and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the
                    advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interest and to provide information to our sales
                    team. We will also provide this information to third parties for these purposes.
                </li><li><strong>Social Media Cookies</strong>.
                    Third parties that make their applications available through/on our Sites may set their own cookies
                    in order to track the performance of their applications or customize those applications for you. For
                    example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Sites (e.g., Facebook,
                    Twitter, or Instagram), the social network that has created the button will record that you have
                    done this. Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties
                    access the data in cookies used by us. Some pages of our website may also contain embedded content,
                    such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own cookies.

                regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. However, we do not recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining

                what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

                Concerning Article 27(2)(a) of the GDPR, a representative is not required when a company is processing
                EU personal data, if:
            </p><ul><li>personal data is only processed occasionally</li><li>processing does not include large-scale processing of special categories of personal data or
                    personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences and
                </li><li>processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</li></ul><p>
                We believe that the above mentioned exceptions are applicable for Power Thesaurus and there is no real
                need
                or legal requirement to appoint EU Representative for Power Thesaurus.
