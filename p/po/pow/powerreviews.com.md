### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect “personal information” about users of the Site and the Review Service in the normal course of our business. As used in this Policy, “personal information” is information that identifies or is capable of being associated with an identifiable person. Examples of personal information include, but are not limited to, a user’s name, email address, or phone number. Most of the personal information we receive comes directly from users who register on the Site, use the Review Service or who otherwise voluntarily provide information to PowerReviews in connection with various activities on the Site or Review Service. Personal information does not include aggregate, anonymized, or de-identified information (collectively, “Aggregate Information”). “Aggregate Information” is information gathered or generated directly by the use of the Site or Review Service, such as information collected about Site or Review Service users, or a category of services or users, from which any personal information has been removed. An example of Aggregate Information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the Site’s registered users have identified themselves as male.

**Site** : The information you submit at registration on the Site may include, without limitation, name phone number, and e-mail address. We may also collect other types of information during registration or in connection with your other activities on the Site, such as demographic information (including, without limitation, your age, sex and/or gender identity, occupation, interests, location, and income) and information about or contained in postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of the Site, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason (such as to request customer service or provide us with comments or feedback).

**Review Service** : Through the Review Service, you may submit star ratings, reviews, comments, photos, videos, questions, and other user-generated content (collectively, “UGC”).  Any UGC you submit may be used for advertising purposes and posted to publicly-facing websites, including other websites across the Internet and on the PowerReviews network, in addition to the website that you originally submitted the UGC. Accordingly, please do not post anything that you do not want to share with the general public (for example, financial information, social security number, etc.). In addition, the UGC that you submit may be used for other advertising, analytic and statistical purposes including, for example, product improvement, benchmarking (e.g. where various products/services or categories of products/services are compared against each other or against the market as a whole), sentiment analysis (e.g. using the data from multiple reviews it is possible to determine how consumers as a whole feel about a product/service), and online behavioral advertising.  We may also collect other types of information in connection with your activities on the Review Service, such as demographic information (including, without limitation, your age, weight, size, hair color, sex, occupation, interests, location, and income) and information about or contained in postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of the Review Service, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason (such as to provide us with comments or feedback). In order to submit UGC, you may have to create an account with the PowerReviews’ client whose products, services or goods you are reviewing or rating. During the course of creating an account, you may be asked to submit information, such as but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, and other data (collectively, “Consumer Account Info”).  The Consumer Account Info may be collected by both PowerReviews and the applicable PowerReviews’ client. To further understand how the PowerReviews’ client to whom you have submitted UGC and Consumer Account Info will use such data, please consult the terms and conditions of that client’s website (e.g. privacy policy).

We automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Review Service. We log your IP address. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we also log that information. This helps us understand our users’ interests and maximize our online exposure. Please see Cookie, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies below for additional information.

### THIRD PARTY SITES

The Review Service may be displayed on or through Third Party Sites through a connection to PowerReviews API or with the use of inline frame or other framing techniques. We may collect personal information in stand alone Write a Review pages, framed pages or content located on or provided by Third Party Sites. When you submit personal information to us in this manner, it is treated as personal information under this Policy. The collection and use of personal information by the Third Party Site directly (i.e., outside of the Review Service Write a Review pages or framed pages) is governed separately by the privacy policy of such site.
