# PowerBar: Privacy

### Privacy Policy

**Welcome**

Thank you for visiting PowerBar.com. This privacy policy tells you how Nestlé USA uses personal information collected at this web site. Please read this privacy policy before submitting any personal information at this site. By using this site you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. We may infrequently change these practices, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information collected on a going forward basis.  If we materially change how we use your previously collected personal information, we will notify you by email.  You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy pertain only to the on-line collection of information.

**Children’s Privacy Policy**

We have no intention of collecting information from children at this web site.

**What We Collect and How We Use It**

_Personally Identifiable Information_

We collect the following personally identifiable information: name, postal address, email addresses, birthdate, and phone number. This information is only collected when voluntarily submitted by visitors to help fulfill a specific offer or request. For example: to receive email updates or newsletters about the site, our products and promotions; to send you samples, if offered and requested; to enter a specific sweepstakes or other on-line promotion; when a visitor registers as a member of a web site; to help personalize the web site for you; or to respond to a question or issue in a contact or email section. Note if you choose not to provide this information, certain personalized features of the web site may not be available to you. The information you provide is used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example when registering for a sweepstakes, you may opt in to receive future information from Nestlé.

Some web sites may ask for a birthday for screening purposes. 

We have no intention of collecting information from children at this web site.

To make the registration process easier, Nestlé has a "one time" registration feature, which is used across many of Nestlé's web sites. This means that if you have registered at one Nestlé site, and then enter your email address to register at another site, this new site will recognize you as a returning visitor. Don't worry; you must still opt in to receiving future information from the new Nestlé site or Nestlé product.

If you elect to receive information from us, you may receive information by regular mail or email, depending on the information you provided at registration. From time to time, our outbound communications may feature products/services from other reputable organizations, companies or products that may interest you. Your personally identifiable information is not shared with these other companies. All mailings come from Nestlé or its agents, who are bound to keep information confidential.

We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are: 

  * We may share your information with our agents who assist us in administering the site and various programs and promotions. They can only use the information to administer our site and programs. These agents are required to keep your information private and secure. 
  * From time to time we may run a joint promotion on this site with another company or organization. At the time of collection, you will always be advised if another company is also collecting information. We recommend you review that company's privacy policy, and we may provide a link to that company's privacy policy. 
  * Sometimes we run programs featuring another company's service or products and you are given the opportunity to opt in to future receipt of information from that company. We recommend you review that company's privacy policy, and we may provide a link to that company's privacy policy. 
  * We may also disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to comply with laws, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of Nestlé, its customers and the public. 
  * In the event of an acquisition of all or part of Nestlé by another company, or in the event that Nestlé were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Nestlé business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestlé business, which could include personally identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.



Nestlé may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records to enhance our consumer profiles for our own marketing purposes.

Cookie and tracking technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the web site, and understanding how visitors use the site. Cookies can also help tailor the site to visitors' needs and help customize the site for visitors.

Personally identifiable information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate (not individual) cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.

**Tell a Friend and Electronic Postcards**

If you send a friend an email or postcard from this site, the referral information you provide (names and email addresses) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not further retained by Nestlé.

**Demographic Information and Surveys and Polls**

We may ask for demographic or profile (age, gender, household, interests, etc.) information in a survey/poll or at registration. This information is used to assist us in tailoring the site, our communications, and our products to visitors and consumers. We may share aggregated demographic and survey information, as opposed to individual information, with third parties.

**Security, Opting Out, and Access to Information**

Nestlé uses commercially reasonable efforts to keep personally identifiable information secure. Only authorized Nestlé employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information and only to help Nestlé administer its promotional programs and the site. Personally identifiable information is also password protected at the web site.

All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings.  Many Nestlé web sites have an update information feature that allows visitors to access (via password) the registration information they submitted to the site, for review/update and opt out purposes.  If this feature is not available at a site or if you have questions about this policy you may contact us ( [Click Here](https://web.archive.org/About/ContactUs/) ) or call us at 1-800-587-6937.
