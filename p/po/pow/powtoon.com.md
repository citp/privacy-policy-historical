## How Do We Protect Your Information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter or submit any personal details to Powtoon.

Powtoon uses a secure server. All sensitive information, including credit card details, is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and then encrypted into our payment gateway provider's database, which is only accessible to those authorized with special access to each system. These personnel are required by law to keep confidential all information on our systems.

In addition, after any transaction, your credit card details and financial information are immediately deleted from our servers.

We also use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, save your preferences for future visits, and compile aggregated data about site traffic and site interactions, so that we can offer better website experiences and tools in the future.

We store such cookies for a period of 14 days, after which such cookies are deleted.

In addition, we contract third party service providers to assist us in gaining a better understanding of the way users visit and use our website. We do this through the use of such third party service providers' cookies, which are placed on your browser when you log in to our website. Such providers can then analyze the data included in such cookies to provide us with valuable insights, such as the average number of visitors to the website or the preferred browser language of most users.

## Do We Disclose Any of Your Personal Information to Outside Parties?

Third Party Providers

We are assisted by trusted third parties to operate our website, to conduct our business, and to provide you with our services. Such third party providers include billing companies, website infrastructure management, and analytics service providers. As part of the provision of their services to us, we may transfer some of your personal information to them, inasmuch as such personal information is necessary for them to perform such service. For example: your credit card details will be analyzed through our billing software which is provided by a third party in order for us to provide you with an invoice when you make a purchase on our website.

These third party providers are located in:

  1. The European Union;
  2. Israel – which has been granted an adequacy decision by the European Commission, meaning that it is considered to be a ‘safe’ country in Data Protection terms, and it provides an equivalent level of protection to personal data as provided within the European Union;
  3. The United States – under the Privacy Shield framework.



We also entered into contracts with such third party providers in order to ensure that the personal information we provide them regarding our users is kept confidential and secure.

Other Forms of Disclosure

In certain circumstances, we may also disclose your personal information to outside parties. This could happen if:

  1. We believe that, under the specific circumstances, releasing such personal information will be appropriate in order to comply with any European Union or Member State law applicable to us;
  2. We want to protect our legitimate interest and in order to do so we would need to disclose your personal information, and only after we made sure that we cannot protect our interest without disclosing your personal information;
  3. We need to protect your or another individual’s vital interests.



No personal information will ever be provided to outside parties for marketing, advertising, or other such uses without your consent, or where we are obliged to disclose such information by law.

## Third Party Links

Occasionally, and at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party websites have separate and independent privacy policies and should be researched independently by anyone wishing to use their services. Although we are not responsible for the content and activities of such third party websites, we do seek to protect the integrity of our website, and would thus welcome your feedback regarding such websites if you have any concerns you wish to share with us.

## Privacy of Children

We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

We do not collect any personal information from anyone under 16 years of age. Our website, products, and services are all directed to individuals who are at least 16 years or older.

When visitors to our website indicate that they are aged 16 or younger, they are not required to disclose their personal data.

When students access Powtoon in the framework of a school project, they have the opportunity to provide the contact details of their teacher, rather than their own personal data.

If we update this privacy policy in a manner which changes how we collect or use your personal information, the types of personal information we collect or use, or the purposes for such collection or use of personal information, we will ask for your renewed consent. This will be conducted in two steps:

  1. We will send a notification to the email address you provided us with upon registration. In this notification, the new proposed changes will be explained so that you may provide us with your consent;
  2. Following the email notification, we will ask you to provide your consent to the new changes when you next log in to our website.
