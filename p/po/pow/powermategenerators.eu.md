**8\. Cookies**

The Sites use cookies for assuring the integrity of the registration procedure and for customizing the Sites. A cookie is a small sized text file saved in the hard disk of the user from a web page. Cookies cannot be used for executing programs or sending viruses to the computer of the user. Cookies are assigned to the user in a univocal way and can be only read by the Web server of the domain, which sent them.

One of the main purposes of cookies is to make the user save time. For instance, if you customize a Web page or visit a website, a cookie will allow the visited site to recall specific information about the user in the following visits. The use of cookies allows providing the user with customized contents and simplifies the visit of the websites. At the following visit to the website, the previously provided information may be retrieved thus simplifying the use of customized features for the user.

For the sending of cookies in PR INDUSTRIAL website, a Web technology based on beaconing, also known as "clear gif" or action tag technology may be used. Such technology allows PR INDUSTRIAL to compile aggregated statistics related to the use of the Sites, like for instance the links or the pictures. PR INDUSTRIAL can provide its own partners with aggregated statistical data.

Some Web beacons can be put by service providers of third parties for allowing detecting the efficacy of our advertising campaigns or of the e-mail communications. Such Web beacon may be used by user providers for putting a persistent cookie in the user's computer. That allows the service provider to recognize the computer every time the user visits certain Web pages or e-mail messages and compile anonymous information related to viewing these pages. PR INDUSTRIAL forbids the use of Web beacon targeted to the access or collection of personal information of the user.
