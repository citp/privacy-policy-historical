# Privacy Policy & Legal Disclaimer

                        

Your right to privacy while using the World Wide Web is very important to RTM Productions, Inc. ("RTM"). RTM is committed to helping you maintain control over your personal data while fostering the growth of a more interactive, engaging, and personalized web experience. We respect your right to control how much information you provide about yourself. The following Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from visitors to our web sites, including Horsepowertv.com, Truckstv.com, Xtreme4x4tv.com, PowerBlocktv.com, and Musclecartelevision.com (the "Site(s)"). By using one of our Sites, you agree to the terms of this Policy. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through our Sites and not to information collected offline.

1.What Personally Identifiable Information Is Collected

We do not collect personally identifiable information on our Sites unless you voluntarily provide information about yourself via an electronic mail message or by filling out one of our online forms. By "personally identifiable information," we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address or telephone number. For example, if you send us an email or call us, we may use the information you provide to follow up via telephone or email. The information you provide will be kept confidential and will be used only to support your continued relationship with RTM.

We may conduct contests, sweepstakes and surveys through our Sites. We request contact information from you in connection with your participation for the purpose of conducting the promotion. Any personal information collected may be used by us or the sponsors of the contest, and may be associated with registration information.

No software or hardware techniques are employed to capture a visitor's email address or other personally identifiable information. RTM does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our Sites, and we do not use invisible images to track how you use our Sites. Our hosting company may collect anonymous, aggregate information or statistics related to Site usage. These statistics indicate the total number of hits, the total number of page hits, the number of kilobytes transferred from our Sites, and the IP address of the visitor. If we decide to use this information to analyze Web traffic in the future, we will only be able to measure the number of visitors to our Sites and the addresses of the web sites from which our visitors come. Email addresses and other personally identifiable information are not available to us unless you affirmatively supply such information.

2.How the Information You Provide Is Used

Should you send us your comments or questions via email to any email address provided on one of our Sites, we will only share your communications with our employees or agents most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in some cases, archive it. We share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order processing and sweepstakes fulfillment. From time to time, our advertising and promotional partners may desire to use information collected through our Sites to call to your attention to promotions and offers they believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us any information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us with information, you will not receive email or other communications sent directly by our advertisers utilizing information collected from our Sites, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. In all cases, however, we will use your information only as permitted by law.

Except as provided herein, we will not disclose personal information unless we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of any of our Sites; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. We do not sell our mailing lists or other personally identifiable information you provide us to third parties.

3.Security of Information Sent to Us

Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the email functionality on our Sites does not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between us. Like all unencrypted Internet email communications, your email may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, RTM cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. If you wish, you may contact us via telephone at the number provided tin this privacy policy.

4.Disclosure of Customer Information Through Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the unlikely event that a portion or substantially all of RTM's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, the information you have voluntarily provided to us, including your email address, would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

5.Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen years. Our Sites are directed to adults at least eighteen years old, and when a user discloses personal information through one of our Sites, the user is representing to us that he or she is an adult. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian email us at webmaster@PowerBlocktv.com, and we will promptly delete the child's information from our records.

6.Privacy Policies of Web Sites Not Under Our Control

For your convenience, our Sites may provide links to various web sites that we do not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our Sites and connected to the web site of the organization or company that you selected. We are not responsible for the nature, quality or accuracy of the content or opinions expressed in such web sites, and such web sites are not investigated, monitored or checked for quality, accuracy or completeness by us. Inclusion of any linked web site on through one of our Sites does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked web site by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these web sites. Even if an affiliation exists between RTM and a third-party web site, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a web site that is linked to from one of our Sites, we encourage you to consult that web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information and whenever interacting with any web site.

7.Access and Correction

You have a right to know about the personal information that RTM has collected through our Sites, including the right to correct, amend or delete the information that RTM has on file if it is incorrect. You may also change the status of whether you wish to receive alerts, newsletters and communications at anytime. If at any time you wish to exercise these rights, feel free to contact us at info@powerblocktelevision.com or by phone.

8.Modifications to This Privacy Policy

By using any of our Sites, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not disclose any personal information through any of our Sites. This Policy and the use of our Sites are governed by Tennessee law. Any claim related to any of our Sites or this Policy shall be brought in a federal or state court in Tennessee, within one year after the claim arises. Users of our Sites consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution of disputes concerning this Policy and/or use of our Sites.

Please bear in mind that we may change the content or design of any of our Sites, and consequently, this Policy at any time in the future. Notice of any revisions will be posted to this page and on the homepage of each of our Sites, so please revisit this page from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it. You are responsible for reviewing this Policy periodically, and your continued use of our Sites following any modifications to this Policy will be conclusively deemed acceptance of any changes.
