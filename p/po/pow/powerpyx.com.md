When leaving a comment below a post your IP (internet protocol) address will be stored on our server. Furthermore, you must enter an email address to leave a comment. A log file with the email address you entered will be stored on our server and can only be seen by the admin and moderation team. This is done strictly for spam prevention purposes.

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into accounts.
