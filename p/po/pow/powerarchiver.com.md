ConeXware has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit ConeXware's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

ConeXware strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, ConeXware intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

ConeXware collects Personal Information when you place an order for one of our products, request support from ConeXware, sign up for a newsletter, or submit a PowerArchiver skin.
