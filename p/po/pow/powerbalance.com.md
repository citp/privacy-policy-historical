# Privacy Policy | Power Balance

This privacy policy covers how POWER BALANCE treats Personal Information (as defined in the Terms of Use) that POWER BALANCE collects and receives on the Website, including information related to your past use of the Website. Your Personal information is information about you that may or may not be personally identifiable like your user name, password, email address, or personal profile data that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that POWER BALANCE does not own or control or to people that POWER BALANCE does not employ or manage. All Personal Information containing your email and any answers solicited from you for a Profile that is entered into the Website by you is private to you except to the extent that you opt – against our recommendation - to share such Personal Information with other members. Other than for the reasons explicitly described below, it is the policy of POWER BALANCE not to disclose Personal Information to any third party at any time.

Conversely, given that a portion of the purpose of the Website is to share what its customers have experienced with others, our policy regarding Submissions is very different. While our objective is to safeguard your identity, privacy and anonymity, our goal is also to publicly publish and promote the Submissions that describe what you have experienced without identifying who you are so that others can recognize experiences that have been shared by people who are similar in background to themselves. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself, other family members or friends in the Website. POWER BALANCE does not control or endorse the content, messages or information exchanged by means of the Website and, therefore, POWER BALANCE specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Website and any actions resulting from your participation in the Website.
