# The Life: Privacy Policy

### Who we are

The Life Project (operator of www.thelife.com) is a ministry of Power to Change Ministries (P2C), which in turn is part of Campus Crusade for Christ International (CCCI), a worldwide evangelistic and discipleship ministry with representative local ministries in over 160 countries. P2C is comprised of P2C as well as a number of local [ministries](https://p2c.com/) that operate within P2C. Throughout this document “we” and “ours” refers to the organization as a whole as well as to individual field ministries, and “you” and “yours” refers to any and all ministry partners and public site users.

### Our commitment to you

We are committed to protecting and appropriately handling private and personal information and take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, process, use, disclose, and share your personal information or personal data.

### How we protect your information

The security of your information is important to us. P2C has implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser when finished using P2C websites on a shared or unsecured device.

Some of our systems involve the storage and processing of your personally identifiable information outside of Canada using the services of third party service providers. Although we have undertaken measures, including obtaining contractual commitments, to safeguard your personally identifiable information whenever it is shared with other parties, if your personally identifiable information is stored or processed outside of Canada, it will also be subject to the laws of those other jurisdictions.

However, this does NOT apply to personal data – including sender and/or recipient e-mail addresses — contained in ordinary e-mail notes while these are en route between your computer and our servers, during which time these notes must be considered public data.

We will never send you e-mail notes containing any sensitive or private information such as credit card details, and strongly urge you to never place such information in emails.

## The information we collect from or about you

### Personal Information

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information is any information about an identifiable individual, other than an individual’s business contact information when collected, used or disclosed for the purposes of enabling the individual to be contacted in relation to their business responsibilities.

### Protecting the privacy of children (under 13)

Although our web sites are primarily targeted at adult users, we may also choose to provide online resources for younger persons. Safeguarding the security and privacy of children is of paramount importance. Therefore, we will obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information about children and will not knowingly give children the ability to post publicly or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior verifiable parental consent.

### The limitations of our privacy policy

Any personal data voluntarily disclosed by you on bulletin boards, in chat rooms, in e-mail notes or in any other public forum provided by our organization, could potentially be accessed and “harvested” by third parties and is therefore not subject to our privacy policy. In addition, external web sites linked to by any of our web sites may not adhere to our Privacy Policy, and you should refer to their Privacy Policy to understand the rules under which they operate.
