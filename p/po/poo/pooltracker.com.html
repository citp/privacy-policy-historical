</p><p>
When you visit the Pooltracker.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users.

<b>The Way We Use Information</b>

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

</p><p>
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
