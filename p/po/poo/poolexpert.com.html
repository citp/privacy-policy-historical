<h1>Privacy Statement for ST Communications<hr></h1>

<p class="l3">
ST Communications has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination
practices for all ST Communications' Web sites.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p class="l3">
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration
of the information under our control. We take the security issue very seriously, and will
always do our best to protect our visitors. However, no security mechanism is perfect and
all visitors must understand that there are always risks that the personal information you
send to ST Communications may be intercepted by others through no fault of our own.
ST Communications is not responsible for such security breaches so long as it is not due
to negligence on our part.
</p>

<h2>What information does ST Communications collect from you?</h2>
<p class="l3">
Under some circumstances (for example if you create a free hockey pool on PoolExpert.com),
ST Communications requires that you submit your name, mailing address, and certain other
personal information when filling out our registration form. However, any time that
ST Communications wishes to collect such information, you will be warned in advance.
ST Communications will always allow you to view the information that we have on file about
you. You will also be able to make changes (eg. Address changes) to your profile whenever
you like. Please e-mail
<a href="mailto:support@stcommunications.ca">support@stcommunications.ca</a> for any such requests.
</p>

<h2>Why does ST Communications need this information?</h2>
<p class="l3">
Collecting this data allows us to quickly and easily contact you. For example, we may need
to notify you of technical issues, or if you win a prize using one of our sites
(eg. PoolExpert). If you like, we can also keep you informed of new products and services
being offered by ST Communications, but we will always give you the choice of whether you
wish to receive this type of information or not. 
</p>

<p class="l3">
ST Communications would like to make it clear that none of our advertisers, clients, or
partners have access to your personal data. In addition, ST Communications will never
disclose your personal data to any outside party without your knowledge and consent except
under the most exceptional circumstances such as: police authorities force us to by law/warrant;
it is required for ST Communications to protect ourselves against actions taken against us
which threaten our rights and/or property, or those of our visitors, clients, partners,
advertisers, or retailers.
</p>

<p class="l3">
Our sites provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
promotional/marketing information from us by sending email to
<a href="mailto:info@stcommunications.ca">info@stcommunications.ca</a>. 
</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>
<p class="l3">
ST Communications' Web sites contain links to other sites. Clicking on any of these links
will take you away from our site. ST Communications is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of such Web sites.  Any personal information that you submit to these sites are subject only to the privacy
policies that they offer. ST Communications is not responsible for privacy breakdowns
which occur on other sites.
</p>
<p class="l3">
ST Communications works with a third party (Flycast Communications) that serves ads to
our sites. Flycast also takes the issue of privacy very seriously. To find out more about
how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on our
sites, please visit <a href="http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html">http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html</a>.
Note that these ads may require cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our
Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by Flycast, and we do not have
access to this information. 
</p>

<h2>Public Forums</h2>
<p class="l3">
ST Communications's Web sites may contain forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these
areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to
disclose any personal information. ST Communications is not responsible for privacy breakdowns
which occur on public forums.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p class="l3">
Currently, all ST Communications' Web sites are available to any and all visitors, and
we do not exclude anyone from using our sites based on their age (which we usually
don't know anyway).  However, if we notice that a minor has sent us any private information
through one of our sites, we would try, if possible, to inform the minor's
parents by e-mail that their child had done so.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p class="l3">
A cookie is information that a Web site puts on your hard disk so that it can remember
something about you at a later time. For example, if you are visiting a site that offers
you the choice of French or English text, cookies can be used to remember your choice
for the next time that you visit the site. Our advertising agent uses cookies to keep
a record of the ad banners that have been ‘served' to you so that you will not see the
same ads over and over.
</p>
<p class="l3">
The use of cookies has become standard practice in the world of Internet browsing. 
Browsers often come already setup to accept them.  Cookies are harmless. 
You can view the cookies that have been stored on your hard disk (although the content
stored in each cookie may not make much sense to you). The location of the cookies
depends on the browser. Internet Explorer stores each cookie as a separate file under
a Windows subdirectory. Netscape stores all cookies in a single cookies.txt fle.
You always have control over the cookies in your computer. You can delete them, or
change your preferences to not allow the use of cookies in your computer at all. This
will limit the options available to you on certain sites, and will exclude you from
using certain sites that require cookies to operate properly.
</p>
<p class="l3">
ST Communications uses cookies to send information which might be usefull
to our marketing service, and to deliver content specific to your interests, for example,
it is by using cookies that PoolExpert saves your poolname, which means that you don't
need to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 
</p>

<h2>Reservation of Rights</h2>
<p class="l3">
ST Communications reserves the right to modify our privacy policies. We suggest that you
check this privacy statement from time to time to verify our position on privacy. That being
said, the spirit of this statement will never change; we will always take the privacy issue
seriously and will always do whatever is necessary to protect our visitors', clients',
and affiliates' privacy.
</p>
<p class="l3">
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of ST Communications'
web sites, or your dealings with those Web sites, you can contact us by email
at: <a href="mailto:support@stcommunications.ca">support@stcommunications.ca</a>.
