# Privacy Policy - Popdust

**Information Collection**

For each registered user, we collect the consumer’s screen name, e-mail address, IP address, country of residence, street address, and zip code. The information we collect is used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor and used by us to contact users regarding their account. This information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes without user consent.  Unregistered users may use the portions of the Popdust site that do not require registration. The IP addresses of these users are stored.

In addition to personal information—as noted above—we may also collect information that is in no way personally identifiable. This may include your operating system, your internet browser, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and the web sites you visit directly before and after your visit to Popdust.com.  ****

**How does Popdust use my collected information?**

**** In order for Popdust to maintain and operate a site that is free of charge and does not require user registration, we display advertisements on our web site. The information you provide us is also used to help our advertisers target the specific audience they’re trying to reach.  Only Popdust.com, however, will have access to your personally identifiable information, and you will never be contacted by any party other than Popdust.com. The only exceptions to the foregoing are that we may disclose personally identifiable information (i) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, (ii) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take actions regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of another person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law, or (iii) in the event we are acquired by or merged with another company.

**Cookies**

****We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, customize web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

**Editorial Policy**

The content of Popdust’s emails is chosen completely at the discretion of the Popdust Editorial Team. No one can pay to change the opinions written in a Popdust email. Selling our editorial content would destroy the legitimacy, integrity, and fun of Popdust emails and would ruin the trust between Popdust and its users. On occasion we will send out “sponsored” emails on behalf of our advertisers, artists, or other music related enterprises that have something special to offer the Popdust community, these emails will be marked as sponsored.

They can also close their account by contacting Popdust through the contact us page. Users may export their reviews and ratings data at any time using the tools provided by Popdust.
