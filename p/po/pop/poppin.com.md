# Privacy Policy

Nice to meet you. We’re poppin. For those who care about these kinds of things, our full corporate name is poppin inc., and we are a Delaware corporation. 

Thank you for visiting us. We understand that you are mindful of how information about you is used and shared. We’ve put together this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to describe how we collect, use, store, process, and share your information in relation to the Site. By the way, when we use the word “Site,” it’s really shorthand for both the poppin.com web site and any other of our applications (like mobile device applications, Facebook pages, etc.) that we may use to put all of our great products at your fingertips and that provide your information to us. 

When you visit or use the Site or place an order, you expressly consent to the collection, use, storage, processing, and disclosure of your information, including personally identifiable information, as described in this Policy. This Policy is part of and incorporated into the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions.html) governing your use of the Site, so please be sure to review the Terms of Use prior to using the Site. **If there is something in this Policy that you don’t agree with, you should not use the Site or place an order.** In addition, you can only use the Site if you are over 18 years old. If you are under 18, you may use the Site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

While we really like the way things are working right now, it is inevitable that we will change some things over time, as we learn more about you and how we can best serve you. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify it, we will post the new version right here, so it is important that you check back on a regular basis to see whether we’ve made any changes, as you will be agreeing to the new Privacy Policy by using the Site after the new version has been posted. For ease of reference, you can view the Last Updated date of this Policy at the top of the page.

We are fanatically driven to make your experience with us easier and better for you.

We may also collect information you provide to us pursuant to promotional programs, such as contests.

Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Using cookies helps us serve you better. It allows us to do things like save items in your shopping cart, save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site, and deliver product recommendations and other content that are customized to fit your interest. If you would prefer that we not use cookies on your computer, feel free to set your browser to reject them; however certain features of the Site may not be available if your browser does not accept cookies. 

We may use third-party companies to help tailor Site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount). 

Google Analytics uses cookies and pixels in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Site, including but not limited to information about the pages where users enter and exit the Site and what pages users view on the Site, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address.

Payment information will be used only to process payment transactions. 

We may also use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes; to detect and protect against errors, fraud, and criminal activity; to assist law enforcement; to enforce this Policy and the Terms of Use; or for any other purpose described in this Policy or that we describe to you at the time of collection.

We may share information with any affiliated entity or organization and to agents and service providers. These third parties include various business services providers or providers that supply support for the Site or otherwise are working directly with us. Examples include for fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending emails, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. 

We may share information when we believe its release is appropriate and necessary to comply with the law; to government regulators or law enforcement authorities in connection with any judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena or legal process served on us or the Site; to enforce or apply this Policy and the Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property or safety of poppin, our employees and users.

#####  How Does poppin Keep My Information Secure? 

We have implemented a number of security measures to protect your personally identifiable information and we have extra layers of security around your payment information. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. In addition, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is important that you keep your password to yourself and log off once you have finished using a shared computer so that others can’t access your account. 

While we take measures to safeguard your personal information, we cannot ensure that all of your information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, a third party may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or other users of the Site may abuse or misuse your personal information. No transmission of data over the internet can be 100% secure. 

If poppin learns of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By providing personally identifiable information to us or using this Site, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues.

Our primary audience is adults. While the Site is not for anyone under the age of 18, we certainly do not intend to and will not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13; children under the age of 18, and therefore children under the age of 13, are prohibited from using our Site without parent/guardian supervision. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information immediately and delete it from our servers (subject to applicable law and this Policy).

When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information is located, so that we can find it.

Removal of your content or information from the Site does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers.

We expect to be around for the long haul. With that said, if poppin should ever file for bankruptcy or engage in a business transition such as a merger with another company, or if poppin decides to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, poppin may disclose your personal information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.
