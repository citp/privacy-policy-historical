# Privacy

Nice to meet you. We’re Poppin. For those who care about these kinds of things, our full corporate name is Poppin Inc., and we are a Delaware corporation.

We’ve put together this Privacy Policy to let you know what types of personally identifiable information we collect from you on the Web Site and what we do with it. By the way, when we use the word “Web Site,” it’s really shorthand for both the poppin.com web site and any other applications (like iPad and iPhone applications, Facebook pages, etc.) that we may use to put all of our great products at your fingertips.

As much as we’d like to meet each of you personally, we know that you’re busy, and that it’s probably not possible. Since there is no way for us to meet personally and sign a contract, this Privacy Policy (along with our Terms of Use) act as the contract between us, and when you use the Web Site, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use (which should be considered part of this document). So, you should definitely read this thoroughly, and if there is something in these Terms that you don’t agree with, you should not use the Web Site (our lawyers thought that the last part was so important that they insisted we put it in bold). In addition, you can only use the Web Site if you are over 18 years old. If you are under 18 – sorry, but please tell your parents, older siblings, etc. and come back when you turn 18.

We’re a brand new company, and while we really like the way things are working right now, it is inevitable that we will change some things over time, as we learn more about you and how we can best serve you. Given that, we must reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify it, we will post the new version right here, so it is important that you check back on a regular basis to see whether we’ve made any changes, as you will be agreeing the new Privacy Policy by using the Web Site after the new version has been posted. For ease of reference, this Privacy Policy was last modified on May 17, 2012.

### What Personally Identifiable Information Does Poppin Collect?

We are fanatically driven to making your experience with us easier and better for you. So, wherever we can, we collect information that may make it easier for us to improve the shopping experience, display the product or content in which you are likely to be most interested, and make it easier for you to reorder without having to enter information you have already provided. Obviously, in trying to identify ways we can help you shop, we may collect some information we end up not using. However, we try to use common sense to only collect what we think could make a difference in your experience and try to limit it to only what we would be willing to share ourselves if we were in your shoes. We believe that you should know the kinds of information we are collecting. Specifically, we collect the following types of personally identifiable information from you:

**Information You Provide:** We collect information that you voluntarily provide when you are using the Web Site, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit card, as well as information about the products you purchase or tell us you are interested in.

**Information Collected by “Cookies”:** When you visit the Web Site, we may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser, which allows us to recognize you when you return to the Web Site. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Using cookies helps us serve you better. It allows us to do things like save items in your shopping car, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website, and deliver product recommendations and other content that are customized to fit your interest. However, if you would prefer that we not use cookies on your computer, feel free to set your browser to reject them.

**Information Recorded by our Servers:** Our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit the Website, such as the pages you visit on our site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, your browser type, the place on the Internet that you came from immediately before going to the Web Site, the place on the Internet that you go to immediately after leaving the Web Site, the amount of time you spent on particular pages and the date and time of your visit.

**Information Collected by “Clear GIFs”:** We use "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) to track online usage patterns anonymously. In addition, we also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails we may send to you in order to track which emails are opened.

### How Does Poppin Use Personally Identifiable Information?

We use the information you provide to process and fulfill your order, including to send you emails to confirm your order status and shipment. We also may use information we learn about you to customize our Web Site for you and deliver product offers and other information that we think you would be interested in.

### Will Poppin Share Personally Identifiable Information with Others?

We will not share your personally identifiable information with anyone else for their commercial or marketing use except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

### How Does Poppin Keep my Information Secure?

We have implemented a number of security measures to protect your personally identifiable information. In addition, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is important that you keep your password to yourself and log off once you have finished using a shared computer so that others can’t access your account.
