# PopJam - Privacy Policy Summary

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE RELATED TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how SuperAwesome Ltd. and its subsidiaries in the United States (collectively referred to herein as "SuperAwesome", "us" or "we") collects, uses and shares the personal information that you provide to SuperAwesome as a user of the website located www.popjam.com and the affiliated mobile application known as "Popjam" (collectively referred to herein as the "Site"). This Privacy Policy describes what information SuperAwesome collects from users, including children, when they visit the Site; how such information is used and stored; when such information may be disclosed to third parties; how users, parents, and guardians can control the use and disclosure of collected information; and how information is protected. Younger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information. If you are a parent or legal guardian, by allowing your child to use the Site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy on your child's behalf. It is important that you read and understand this Privacy Policy before allowing your child to use the Site. If there is anything within this Privacy Policy that you do not understand, then please contact us at hi@popjam.com or using the contact information listed at the end of this Privacy Policy to discuss what this means for you.

## 1\. Registration/Parental Consent

The Site is a moderated community of kids sharing their digital creations in an environment of mutual trust, support and respect. We use technology and people to monitor kids' activities and communication and to encourage all users to respect our [House Rules](https://web.archive.org/community), [Safety Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/safety), and [FAQ](https://web.archive.org/faq), both of which are incorporated herein by this reference, and which you may also consult for more information about our moderation practices. Upon registration, we ask users to provide only a username for use within the Site. We ask users to pick a username that is unique, e.g., is not the same as or similar to a username used on other Internet services such as social networks, and that does not contain any personal information, such as a full name, school name or geographic location. If we notice and suspect that a user name contains information that could be used to identify a user, we will ask the user to change it. 

We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly. This Site supports and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and other applicable laws. No personally identifiable information is purposefully or knowingly collected from children under the age of 13 by SuperAwesome without parental consent. If you are under the age of 13, you should use this Site only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information ("PII") is personal information about an individual, such as a first and last name, phone number or email address or other individually identifiable information within the meaning of COPPA and the Federal Trade Commission's Online Privacy Protection Rule found at 16 CFR 312.2. Every user hereby agrees that all information you provide, including but not limited to age, shall be truthful and correct.

In circumstances where we seek parental consent, we will send an email to the parent or legal guardian of a child to provide them with a "Direct Notice" as required under COPPA, notifying the type of PII that may be collected from the child and how such information may be used and/or disclosed by us, and obtain verifiable consent. The Direct Notice will provide directions that the parent is required to follow in order to provide us with consent to the collection, use and/or disclosure of the child's PII, as appropriate, and instructions on how the parent can revoke such consent.

In the event that we change our policy with respect to the collection of PII from children, or if new features, contests or sweepstakes which a child wishes to use or participate in require the provision of PII, their parent or guardian will be notified and will be required to give their consent to the collection and use of this information and/or be given the option to opt out of participation.

## 2\. Information We Collect

When you sign up for the Site, you create a profile, which is then publicly available inside the Site. You may not use your real name, a real photo, or any other information that could identify you or your location (such as a school uniform) in the creation of your profile. Your PopJam profile shows your: 

  * User name
  * Profile picture or avatar
  * Profile description
  * Pictures you make and share
  * Who you follow, who follows you and your Top Friends in PopJam
  * Quizzes , tests and games you've taken part in

Quizzes, tests and games that you decide not to share publicly are still listed in your profile but other PopJammers cannot see them.

### Sharing and Search

When you use the Site, your creations and comments are accessible and visible to all users of the Site. There are no private channels or personal chat functions on the Site. Pictures, quizzes, tests, games, comments and other content you share in PopJam can also be shared via URL or "rejammed" (as we call it) by other PopJammers. If you rejam content from another PopJammer their post containing the content will appear in your profile showing their post and user name. Other PopJammers can search for you on PopJam by looking for your user name or profile picture using the search and browsing tools on PopJam.

### Inviting Friends

You may invite your friends to join the Site by sending them an email or a text message using the Site. We do this without storing any PII about you or your friends, in accordance with the one-time use exemption under COPPA. When you select friends to invite, we will use their email address or phone number to send the invitation in a way that the recipients cannot see your email address or phone number. The recipients' contact details are then immediately deleted from our servers. The invitation message is precompiled only with your username and a link to download the app, and it isn't editable.

### Communicating with Us

You may also provide us with PII by communicating directly with us, so we may collect: 

Information and communications you send to us by using one of our public email addresses. When you write to us, we will always ask you to put us in contact with your parents, through whom we can then provide support. Your parents' email address, which you may provide for purposes of us obtaining verified parental consent, or to notify your parents of new features you've requested that may require parental notification, such as push notifications. 

We will only use your contact information to provide assistance to you under the one-time use exemption of COPPA.

### Password Recovery

We ask for your email address in order to enable us to recover your password if you forget it. When you ask us to reset your password, we will protect your email address by ‘hashing' it and using the anonymized hash of your address only to confirm your identity and enable you to reset your password. Your email address will never be stored in a format that could be used to identify you.
