## PRIVACY POLICY

1\. How Information is Collected

We collect certain non-personal information automatically, like IP addresses, browser types, referring websites, and access times, when consumers visit our Site. This “web log” information is not personally identifiable, but provides important information on the number of visitors, and what areas or features they like best. Our visitors can review our Site and participate in many features without disclosing any personal information. 

Kellogg collects personal information including, but not limited to, name, home address, email address, and telephone number, from our Site visitors on a voluntary basis. Visitors can access most of our sites without providing any personal information. However, to participate in some of the programs or features we offer, customers may have to provide personal information. 

For example, we may require your name and e-mail address to add you to an e-mail list or enter you in an online sweepstakes or contest. We may require a home address and telephone number to enter you in a contest or sweepstakes so that we can send prize notifications and prizes or to send you special offers. Users who register to receive information via a wireless device must submit a cell phone number to receive text messages. Users can update their preferences and subscriptions and/or delete their accounts at any time. 

To sign up registered shareholders to receive proxy and other information online, we may ask for a social security or tax identification number and other information to verify your identity. If you apply for a job online, we may ask for your name, home address, phone number, email address, birthdate, Kellogg employee number, and/or last four digits of your social security number. 

We may request feedback from our visitors in the form of surveys, questionnaires or our feedback forms on their preferences and reaction to our products, including demographic information, like age, gender and interests, to help us better serve you. This information will only be used for research purposes and not future marketing activities unless explicitly stated. We ask for credit card information where we offer online shopping opportunities. We also require ship-to and billing information in our online stores. 

Users who want access to special features, promotions, coupons, newsletters, games, and other information on the Site may be required to register for an account. 

In many cases, you may have the opportunity to send website content or information to a friend. In these “refer-a-friend” cases, your friend’s email will only be used to deliver the message and not for future marketing purposes unless otherwise stated. 

We may use one or more web analytics services to provide us with reporting regarding our customers' activities on our Site. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/uploadedFiles/KelloggCompany/Miscellaneous/Service_Providers_Aug2010.pdf) for a list of our service providers and their privacy practices. When you visit our Site, these services may set cookies (i.e., small data files that a site sends to your computer to make your access easier and/or faster) on our behalf and may receive information about your browsing activity (e.g., pages viewed, etc). You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Keep in mind if you do this, then you may not be able to leverage the full functionality of the website such as personalized content or saved passwords. 

By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by these third parties in the manner and for the purposes described herein. For more information on cookies, please see section 6 below. 

2\. Use of Personal Information

Except as otherwise provided herein, personal information shared with Kellogg will be used for the purpose for which it was provided or for the company’s internal marketing or product development purposes, and will not be sold or provided to third parties outside of the Kellogg family of companies for their marketing purposes without your permission. If you decide to provide personal information in order to participate in a special area of our Site, such as registering for e-mail updates or for a special program or contest, we will use the information you provide for that purpose. So that we may better tailor our advertising and offers to you and inform you about products and services that we offer that may be of interest, we will automatically share the personal information that you provide with other Kellogg brands unless you uncheck the applicable box at the registration area. We offer visitors an opt-out option in each of our promotional communications that allows you, at any time, to cease receiving such information.

We may use both personal and non-personal information, individually or combined together, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, improve our products and services, better understand customer interests and preferences, and/or provide you relevant information. We may enhance or merge personal information that you provide with data obtained from third parties.

3\. Sharing of Personal Information

Except as otherwise provided herein, on sites owned by Kellogg, personal information received from any visitor will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided or for internal marketing purposes, or product development purposes, and will not be sold or provided to third parties outside of the Kellogg family of companies for their marketing purposes without your permission. As described above, we will automatically share your personal information with other Kellogg brands. Your personal information may also be shared with research, technical, fulfillment, and other Agents to help us make the Site available, provide services and products, understand your needs, respond to your requests, and for internal marketing and product development purposes. We may also provide your personal information to third parties for analytics purposes. And in those cases, we will require our third party agents to maintain the confidentiality of the data. We may use third parties to enhance or update your profile information to better serve our consumers. 

In some circumstances, we may partner with another company to provide certain content, programs or features. Examples include certain promotions, loyalty programs, sweepstakes or contests. In those situations, when you provide personal information about you or your child, it may be sent directly to Kellogg and to our partner company, or we may share the information with our partner company. At the time of registration, we will let you know whether, in addition to Kellogg, another company is collecting information or if we need to share your personal information with a partner company to provide the program, service or feature. We (and our partner company) will also provide a link to the respective online privacy policies so that you can make an informed decision about whether to share your (or your child’s) information. If you choose to not have your or your child’s information shared, your information will not be shared, and you will not be able to participate in or receive the benefits or services provided by our business partners. Although we strive to only partner with companies who agree to adopt privacy policies that are consistent with our own values and policy, and who agree to comply with [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html), we are not responsible for the policies or offerings of any third party, and urge you to review their policies and terms and conditions as they may vary. 

4\. Governing Law; Information Transfers

This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States. The server(s) that make(s) this Site available and database(s) where information may be stored may be located outside the country from which you accessed this Site, in a country that does not have the same privacy laws as your country of residence. The personal information made available to us may, therefore, be transmitted abroad, but we will collect, process, and use personal information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By visiting this Site and submitting information, you consent to such collection, processing, transfer and/or storage of your personal information. For detailed information on our privacy practices with respect to consumer data from consumers located in the European Union, please see our [EU Safe Harbor Privacy Policy](http://www.kelloggcompany.com/safeharbor.aspx). Employment-related queries may also be transferred to any Kellogg company worldwide, and we have instituted procedures to comply with applicable EU data protection laws in connection with such transfers.

5\. Collection of Information From Children Under 13

We are especially mindful of the need for children under 13 who may visit this Site to consult with their parents before furnishing personal information and have adopted special procedures to safeguard children’s privacy online. We've developed our privacy practices from guidelines established by the [Children's Advertising Review Unit (“CARU”)](http://www.caru.org/) and in compliance with the requirements established by the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html). We also recommend that you monitor your children’s online activities and learn about and use software or other tools that can help you assure that your children enjoy the Internet in a manner that reflects your own preferences.

Kellogg does not condition a child’s participation in an activity on disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate. We may ask visitors to enter a birthdate to restrict those who are underage from accessing certain sites, areas, or features. We may collect a child’s first name and email address without a parent’s consent, but only to respond to a one time question or request, and we promptly delete this information after we respond. Where a child under 13 signs up for a newsletter or other activity requiring multiple online contacts, we will ask the child for a parent or legal guardian’s email address so we can notify them and get their permission or give them the opportunity to opt out.

For all personal information, we require verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian first via a method that meets COPPA guidelines. Provided we have parental permission, we may collect additional personal information from a child such as a first name, email address, home address, and telephone number. This information helps us to personalize special offers, sweepstakes, contests, and games, and to offer other activities we think will be of interest to our consumers under the age of thirteen.

6\. Use of Cookies or Other Technologies

As mentioned in section 2 above, Kellogg uses "session cookies," "persistent cookies," and "Flash cookies" to remember important information that will make your use of the Site more enjoyable, efficient and useful; they do not contain personal information. We use cookies and IP addresses to obtain non-personal information from online visitors, provide registered users with a customized, personalized, online experience, and tailor our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of our visitors. They can, for example, help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited, allow you to personalize your pages, and help you to participate in some activities or events on the Site. We also use cookies to determine how many people visit our Site, and which features are most useful and popular and which may need improvement. We may also use session cookies to prevent circumventing the age-screening process for COPPA compliance purposes, and we may use persistent cookies at registration areas.

If you don't want "session cookies" or "persistent cookies", you can turn these off or have your computer notify you when these cookies are being sent by following the instructions for your particular web browser, such as Safari, Firefox, Opera, or Internet Explorer. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by Web browser add-ons, such as "Flash cookies," by changing the add-on's settings or [visiting the web site of its manufacturer](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). If cookies are turned off, you may not be able to access certain features.

We may also use another technology, called clear GIFs or web beacons, to provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when an email has been opened, the number of visitors who have viewed our web pages, and the activities and features that are of most interest to consumers.

7\. Security Measures

Kellogg uses reasonable efforts to make sure all personal information received from our online visitors is secure from unauthorized access and use. All personal information from our customers is protected by our security measures, such as encryption which are periodically reviewed. Kellogg also requires it’s Agents to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.

Kellogg cares about the safety and security of your credit card transactions or shareholder information and uses 124-bit SSL (“Secure Sockets Layer”) when you provide your credit card or other similar sensitive personal information to us online. SSL is the industry standard security protocol which makes it difficult for others to intercept your information online. We safeguard your credit card data in our internal systems through the use of credit card industry standard protections. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient.

8\. Links to and from Other Sites

This Site may contain links to other sites. We make every effort only to link to websites that share our high standards of decency, fairness, and integrity. We try our best to ensure that these links are safe for children, but the privacy and data collection practices on any linked websites are entirely separate from Kellogg and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Kellogg shall not be responsible for any failure on the part of any linked websites to comply with any privacy policy posted on the website, or any contractual or other legal obligations to which the operators of such website may be subject. In addition, other websites, which may contain material not consistent with Kellogg corporate policies, may also link to the Kellogg websites without Kellogg’s knowledge or consent. Kellogg has no responsibility for the content, policies or actions of these websites.

9\. Reviewing and Updating Your Information

Customers who provide personal information through our websites can review this information in the Customer Center found under the “My Account” or similar account hyperlink on the [www.kelloggs.com](http://www.kelloggs.com/) website. You can review, update, change or delete any or all of your personal information at that site. If you have any concerns about this information or need assistance, you can contact our [Consumer Affairs Department](http://www2.kelloggs.com/ContactUs.aspx).

10\. Updates to this Privacy Policy

Kellogg reserves the right to update, revise, modify and supplement this policy and any disclosures and disclaimers at any time without notice. We may also change the information, features, products, policies, or promotions at this Site at any time without notice. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our Site so please check our Policy periodically for changes. At the end of this Privacy Policy we indicate the date of the latest update to the Policy.
