As a general rule, your personal data will be shared with third parties without your express prior consent only in the cases described below:

Such transfer of data will be made only where there is specific evidence for illegal or abusive conduct. Data may further be shared where it serves the enforcement of terms of use or other contractual agreements. We are furthermore legally obliged to disclose certain information to certain public entities upon request. Such entities include law enforcement agencies that investigate administrative offences subject to fines, and tax authorities.
  * From time to time, we may require the assistance of contractually hired third parties and external service providers in order to provide our services, for instance in the domains of sending advertisements (only where you have explicitly consented beforehand), customer service and processing of payments (PayPal, credit card, etc.). In these cases, we share information with such companies or individuals to enable them to carry out their tasks. Such external service providers are carefully selected and regularly checked in order to ensure your privacy. Service providers may only use the data for the purposes specified by us. Service providers are furthermore contractually obliged by us to treat data strictly in accordance with this privacy policy and German data protection law.
  * As our business evolves, the structure of GameGenetics may change, for instance by a change in legal form or creation, acquisition or sale of subsidiaries, branches or parts of a company. In the course of such transactions, customer data will be transferred together with the relevant part of the company being transferred. In each case of a transfer of personal data to third parties to the extent described above, we will ensure that such transfer is made in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection law.
