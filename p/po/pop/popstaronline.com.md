# Privacy Policy - POPSTAR!

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**             **This Privacy Policy governs each website, mobile site, application and/or other service, regardless of how distributed, transmitted, published or broadcast (herein collectively “Services”) provided by Popstar Publishing, Inc. (“Popstar,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

**(1)   Information You Provide**

We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personal information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, date of birth and physical address (“Personal Information”); and (2) demographic information such as information about your family and age (“Demographic Information”).  We may collect this information through various places through the Services, including online subscription, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us.

(a)  Cookies and Other Technology

A cookie is a data file that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computer and is stored on your computer or other device being used to access the Services.  Some cookies are Flash Cookies, which is a data file placed on your computer or other device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in or downloaded by you to your computer or device.  Cookies and Flash are standard in the industry and may be used for many purposes.  These keep track of things such as areas of the website you visit, for how long, and the websites that referred you to the website or applications, to track your preferences and interests.  If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your computer or device, some features of the Services may not function properly.

We may also use cookie information to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis.  We may shore this aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers, and other third parties for any business purpose.

Some of our emails may contain tags that allow us and our advertisers and other partners to determine the type of content that may be of interest to you.  Those tags may contain Personally Identifiable Information and may be shared with others.  These tags may not be deleted but you can opt out of receiving theses emails.

(b)  IP Addresses

Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or device, usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet.  When you access our Services, we collect some general information about your computer or device, including its IP address, the operating system it uses, the browser software it uses, and your Internet service provider.  We may also retain information regarding the pages you visited, the web sites you visited after visiting this web site, the ads you see, and the ads you click on.  We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our services, gather broad demographic information, and administer our Services.

(c)  GIFS

We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “web becons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the sites and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well) located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.  We may use this technology, or similar technology, to assist us in delivering cookies on our online Services, to count users of the online Services, to monitor how users navigate the online Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or acted upon, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

(d)  Embedded Scripts

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interaction with the Services, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is only active while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

(e)  Third Parties

We may receive information from third parties, including Demographic Information from your mobile carrier, and information from third parties that solicit subscriptions to our magazines.

Also, if you choose to access, visit, and/or use any third party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with the Services, we may receive personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that you have made available to those services, including information about your contacts on those services.  For example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our Services to your contacts or to pull information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our Service.  Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for our Service or enhance or personalize your experience on our Services.  Your decision to use a social networking site in connection with our Services is voluntary.  However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third party social networking services may make available to our Services by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy setting directly with those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy setting directly with those services.  We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share, and provide access to all personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that we receive through third-party social networking services in the same ways described in this Agreement as all of your other information.

(f)  Tracking Requests

Some third-party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites or other online Services which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests.  As a result, we do not respond to these signals.  Go to [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements.
