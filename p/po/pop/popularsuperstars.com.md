# Privacy Policy -

**Disclaimer**

The Popular Superstars site zeroes in on the less visible (but spicier and intriguing) aspects of the lives and lifestyles of popular personalities today—in showbiz, business, industry or politics. We rummage through the Net to get the latest updates on popular public figures that make it to superstardom and bring you all the spicy tidbits—all the noteworthy details.

And we choose only online sources with insider scoops to derive our stories from.

However, we do not guarantee that all the information we get from our sources are accurate. We have no control over their news reportage and how they present it online. Any inaccuracy or outright wrong information found on Popular Superstars, therefore, is not intentional and not designed to malign anyone and cannot be the responsibility, in any way, of this site. Moreover, the site’s admin, managers and writers cannot be held responsible in any way in this regard.

Rest assured, however, that the site and the people involved in it are doing their best to bring you quality news and article items.
