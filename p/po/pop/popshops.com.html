<h2>PopShops (PrestoGifto, Inc.) respects your privacy</h2><p>PopShops respects your privacy and are committed to protecting it. We do not sell your personal information to any third parties. PopShops provides this Privacy Statement to inform you of our Privacy Policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used.
