      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
      <div>
        <p> We value our privacy and assume you value yours. Our Privacy Policy makes this point in painstaking detail, but the gist of it is that we take the safeguarding of your personal information very seriously.</p>

<p>Our website is secure. We obfuscate the links in your showcases to protect you against affiliate ID hijacking. (Remember that you can always do a cookie test to verify that your affiliate ID is linked to your shop's products.)</p>

<h2>PopShops (Rakuten PopShops, Inc.) respects your privacy</h2><p>PopShops respects your privacy and are committed to protecting it. We do not sell your personal information to any third parties. PopShops provides this Privacy Statement to inform you of our Privacy Policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. We've structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit PopShops on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. However, certain users may choose to provide personally identifiable information in registering for our services. </p><p>We make this notice readily available at the bottom of every PopShops Web page.</p>

<h2>Section 1. Cookies</h2><p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer's hard drive. PopShops sends cookies when you surf our site, make purchases, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services. Accepting the cookies used on our site does not give us access to your personally identifiable information, but we may use the cookies to identify your computer. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on PopShop's sites. </p><p>Cookies are typically classified as either "session" cookies or "permanent" cookies. </p><ul>

This can enable us over time to provide a better experience on our site by improving content or personalization and making our site easier to use. </li>
<li>"Permanent" cookies are those that remain on your computer. They are used to facilitate shopping, personalization and registration services. For example, cookies can keep track of what you have selected to purchase as you continue to shop and allow you to enter your password only once on Web pages where a login is required. "Permanent" cookies can be manually removed by the user. </li>
</ul><p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept certain cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.
