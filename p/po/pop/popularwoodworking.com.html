</p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">At <i>popularwoodworking.com,</i> your online privacy is our highest priority. We appreciate your confidence in us and will continue to work diligently to uphold that trust and provide you with a safe and secure environment in which to use and enjoy our services. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000"><i>Popularwoodworking.com</i> is owned and posted by F&amp;W Publications.
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000"><i>Popularwoodworking.com</i> promises to never sell, trade, rent, barter or share personally identifiable information collected during your use of our site without your prior permission. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000"><b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">
Like most internet companies, <i>popularwoodworking.com</i> automatically tracks certain general information about our visitors to help us continually improve the content, design and layout of our site and give you more of what you want to see and use. We collect each visitor’s IP address -- a number automatically assigned to the computer whenever you surf the web -- and use that number to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage. Measuring what parts of the site are most popular with our users helps us to tailor <i>popularwoodworking.com</i> to better suit your needs. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">In order to process, fulfill and service your book, magazine and school orders, we require your e-mail address, postal address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. We keep this information strictly private and confidential. Our security is provided from Verisign, the leading Internet security firm, and we use SSL (secure sockets layer) technology to encrypt your information when it's transmitted over the Internet, ensuring that credit card numbers and other information can be read only by their intended recipient. This technology is used any time you purchase something with a credit card via our site. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">We may ask for personal information when you use certain features of our site, including but not limited to: when you enter a contest or drawing; when you sign up for our e-mail newsletter; or when you sign up for e-mail service. We sometimes ask users to complete surveys used for internal research purposes. If we ask for any specific demographic information, it is only to help us tailor the information, products and services we provide on our site to better fit your needs and interests. Occasionally we may share non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties, but this is only done to improve the quality and content of our site. We never share your personal information with third parties -- only general information about the site's entire user base. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">We also never sell, trade, rent or release our e-mail lists to any interested third parties. We may occasionally send information provided by outside companies to our e-mail users and subscribers, but only if those users and subscribers have already given us specific permission to do so during their initial registration for the services of our site. This third-party information will always come to you directly from our servers and will be identified as a mailing from us, ensuring that no third party will ever have access to our emailing lists. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000"><b>WHAT ABOUT "COOKIES"?</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">
To service you faster and with better quality, we use cookies. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. For instance, when ordering books or other products, our Web site simply assigns you a temporary ID number at random. That ID (and nothing else) is saved as a cookie. This enables us to keep track of the information you enter until you either place your order or close your browser, at which time the unused cookie is automatically removed. All order information is maintained on our secure server; only your temporary ID is passed back and forth and saved in the cookie. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000"><i>Popularwoodworking.com</i> uses cookies to track user traffic patterns, and the "shopping cart" function of our ordering process requires cookies. We may also use cookies to track any of our outside promotional campaigns, such as e-mail or other-site advertising, so that we can know how you learned about popularwoodworking.com. Such information will enable us to better inform potential users of our products and services and improve the quality of our site. Some of our special services use cookies to identify users specifically, enabling us to "remember" your profile and therefore provide you with more effective access to our products and services. You can use most of the features on <i>popularwoodworking.com</i> without having cookies activated in your browser. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000"><b>CHANGES TO POLICY</b>
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">Because earning your trust and confidence is so vital to us, we will always be upfront with you about both our procedures for collecting information and our use of that information. If we ever make any changes in either of these procedures, we will immediately describe those changes clearly on this page. If you have any thoughts or comments regarding this policy, please e-mail us and let us know.
