We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don’t know. This is a commercial web site intended for people over the age of 13. Our email address and contact forms are not for use by those under the age of 13. In order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) we have elected to prohibit the use of our contact forms by pre-teens. By utilizing our contact form(s) you certify that you are at least 13 years of age or older.</p>

<p>Please do not contact or email us if you are under the age of 13 unless you have uploaded the <a href="/resources/poptent-parental-consent-form.pdf">Parental Notice and Consent Form</a>, completed and signed by your parents.</p>
