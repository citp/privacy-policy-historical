# POZ.com Privacy Policy - POZ

CDM Publishing, LLC, D.B.A. as Smart + Strong and POZ (“Smart + Strong” or “POZ”) operates the POZ.com Web site.

The privacy of the users of POZ.com is important to POZ.

Please read the following POZ Privacy Policy: 

This privacy policy governs how POZ treats personally identifiable information (such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, and other information about you that is not publicly available) that POZ receives and collects in connection with your use of the POZ.com Web site and POZ Personals, a dating service for HIV positive people, and other services that POZ may offer, such as, bulletin boards and chat rooms, on POZ.com (the “Service”). POZ may update this policy from time to time by posting a notice of such update on POZ.com or by notifying you directly.

You will need to provide personally identifiable information in order to register for the Service.

Personally identifiable information will be used by POZ only as provided below or for the following purposes: to contact you; to fulfill your requests in connection with the Service or POZ.com, such as for products or services; to match you with another user on POZ Personals; to perform analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of POZ.com; or for such purposes as are described at the point of collection. POZ uses list services to send out information and change notices to users. While POZ only uses list services that it believes are responsible, it will not be liable for any breach of security or for any other action by such list services.

POZ does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13.

POZ uses reasonable precautions to keep secure all personally identifiable information that you share with us. However, e-mail is not secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, you may want to send it by postal mail instead. If we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only. POZ does not disclose, give, sell, lease or transfer personally identifiable information to third parties, except to provide products or services that you request, with your prior consent, or, in POZ’s sole and absolute discretion, as follows: as required by law, such as to respond to subpoenas, or court, administrative, or governmental orders; to protect the rights of POZ; in connection with possible breaches of POZ’s terms of use; in connection with claims that the rights of third parties have been violated; or in connection with possible illegal activity, misrepresentation, fraud or harm to any person.

POZ uses “cookies,” pieces of data stored on users’ hard drives for record keeping purposes. Cookies can make the POZ.com Web site and the Service more useful by storing information about the User’s preferences.

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy you can contact us at [website@poz.com](mailto:website@poz.com?subject=Question%20about%20POZ%20Privacy%20Policy).

Effective: March 19, 2008
