<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Your privacy is very important to us. You must read and agree to the terms of this Privacy
Policy before becoming a Pozible account holder. As part of the normal operation of our
services we collect, use and, in some cases, disclose information about you to third
parties. This Privacy Policy governs the information we collect about you and your use of
information we provide to you. By accepting this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement,
you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the
manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and
subject to the terms of the Pozible User Agreement. 
<br><br>
Although this may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you
should know as much as possible about our practices so that you can make an informed
decision. The privacy practices of this notice apply to the website located at 
<a href="http://www.pozible.com">http://www.pozible.com</a> (collectively the "Site"). 
Pozible is subject to the requirements of
applicable law. We strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout our
Pozible trading community. 
<br><br>
Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Pozible by sending email to <a href="mailto:admin@pozible.com">admin@pozible.com</a>.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy contains a number of references to other information pages on our Site
and other websites. Please note: underlined words and phrases are click-through links to
these pages and websites. Pozible strongly recommends that as you read this Privacy
Policy, you click on such links to obtain further important details about the Privacy Policy,
as they may contain further terms and conditions which apply to you as a Pozible account
holder. 
<br><br>
<b>1. An Important Note About Children.</b>
Children (persons under the age of 18 years) are not eligible to use our services
unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you
are under the age of 18 years, you can use this service only in conjunction with and under
the supervision of your parents or guardians. 
<br><br>
<b>2. Information We Collect</b>
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth,
efficient, safe and customised trading experience. This allows us to provide services and
features that most likely meet your needs, and to customise our services to make your
experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we
consider necessary for this purpose and to achieve this goal. 
<br><br>
To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online registration form, where
you will be required to provide us with your contact information and other personal
information. You are required to provide us with your full name. Under some circumstances
we may require some additional necessary financial information, such as, but not limited
to: if you are registering using an email account at a free email service, or posting a project
on our site. We use your financial information, including credit card information to verify
your name, address, and other contact information.
<br><br>
We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our
Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This
information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may
include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which
URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), what browser you are using,
and your IP address. 
<br><br>
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of our Site. "Cookies"
are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customised services.
We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We
also use "cookies" to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.
Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies
are stored on your hard drive, not on our Site. Most cookies are "session cookies,"
meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to
decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to
use certain features on our Site and you may be required to re-enter your password more
frequently during a session. 
<br><br>
Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our
Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a
user, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of
cookies by third parties. 
<br><br>
If you choose to post a project or support a project on our Site, we collect information
about your trading behaviour. We also collect other users' comments about you. 
<br><br>
If you are a project creator with us, we may choose to collect some additional necessary
information, including billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date
and bank account details. 
<br><br>
If you choose to post messages in our site or other message areas or leave feedback for
other users, we will collect and store such information that you disclose to us. 
<br><br>
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third
parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may
collect such information into a file specific to you. 
<br><br>
If you register for Pozible on another web site or use a web site providing a service for
Pozible or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on Pozible, that web site may
provide personal information about you and your transactions back to Pozible. 
<br><br>
Payment Information is transmitted securely using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption
technology and processed through a secure third party payment gateway (PCI DSS
Compliant). Pozible does not store your payment information (such as credit card or debit
card information) on Pozible servers or databases.<br><br>

<b>This website uses the Google AdWords remarketing service</b>
AdWords Remarketing is a Remarketing and Behavioral Targeting service provided by Google. It connects the activity of
www.pozible.com with the Adwords advertising network and the Doubleclick Cookie. You can opt out of the cookie tracking

<br><br>
<b>3. Our Use of Your Information</b>
We use personal information about you (including but not limited to the information in the
file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past
activities on the Site) to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, help ensure safe trading
on our Site, and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users
to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your
information to identify users using multiple Usernames or aliases. 
<br><br>
If you choose to post a project on our Site, we use your address and billing information to
bill you and provide associated support. 
<br><br>
You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and
promotional efforts, to analyse site usage, to improve our content and product offerings
and customise our Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our Site and
better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and
customised experience while using our services. 
<br><br>
You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you
that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as administrative notices, product
offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User
Agreement and Privacy Policy you expressly agree to receive this information. 
<br><br>
<b>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</b>
Although Pozible uses industry standard practices to protect your personal information,
due to technical limitations, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and
other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this
Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to
disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances (further
details of which are set out below in the "Legal Requests" section), or third parties may
unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore,
although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot and do not
guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private
communications will always remain private. 
<br><br>
As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personal information about you to any third
party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information
may be disclosed, and by agreeing to the User Agreement and Privacy Policy you
expressly agree that your personal information may be disclosed by Pozible in the
following ways: 
<br><br>
Partners. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information
and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to partners and
other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations,
we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you
personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card
number, and bank account number, are never disclosed to advertisers. 
<br><br>
Pozible Community. Throughout the Site, you are identified by your full name. If you select
your email address as your full name you will disclose your email address to other users
and third parties. As a result, other users and third parties might send you unsolicited email
and be able to personally identify all of your activities on the Site. Even if your full name is
not your email address, your full name can be used to identify you and your activities
throughout the Site. Other people can see the projects that you have supported in the
past, associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on. We also provide a
number of ways to allow other users to find more out about you and your Site activities,
such as our feature that allows users to quickly see all of the projects you have created
and supported at the time. If you are involved in a transaction, we allow other users to view
your full name, email address and obtain your contact information. 
<br><br>
External Service Providers. There are a number of services offered by external service
providers that help you use our Site (e.g., co-branded sites, listing agents, authentication,
mediation). If you choose to use these optional services, disclose personal information to
the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect personal
information about you, then their use of your personal information is governed by their
privacy policy. We may, for your convenience, provide some of your personal information
to the external service provider offering such services. However, before we disclose your
personal information to an external service provider, you will have the opportunity to see
what data is about to be sent and have the ability to approve the disclosure. To prevent our
disclosure of your personal information to an external service provider, you can decline
such disclosures or simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy
practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use
their services. 
<br><br>
Internal Service Providers. We may use internal service providers to facilitate our services
(e.g., search, discussion boards, surveys) and therefore we may provide some of your
personal information directly to them. In some instances, the internal service provider may
collect information directly from you (such as the situation where we ask an internal
service provider to conduct a survey for us). In these cases, you will be notified of the
involvement of the internal service provider, and all information disclosures you make will
be strictly optional. In all cases, the information we supply the internal service providers is
restricted by confidentiality agreements. If you provide additional information to an internal
service provider directly, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable
privacy policy. 
<br><br>
Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including personal information about
you, with Pozible companies &amp; joint ventures that are committed to serving your online
trading needs and related services, as allowed by applicable law. To the extent that these
entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they
treat information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint ventures
follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this
Privacy Policy, to the extent allowed by applicable law. It is possible that Pozible,
subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination of such, could merge with or be
acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect
that Pozible would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the
service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) as provided in
Section 11 ("Notice") we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices
disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 
<br><br>
Legal Requests. Pozible may lawfully disclose your personal information for law
enforcement or regulatory purposes. Pozible cooperates with law enforcement inquires
and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. We can (and
you authorise us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other
governmental officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary, appropriate or as
otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), in connection with an investigation
of fraud, intellectual property infringements, piracy or other activity that is illegal or may
expose us to legal liability. 
<br><br>
<b>5. Your Use of Other Users' Information</b>
In order to facilitate interaction among all Pozible community members, our service allows
you limited access other users' contact information. As a project creator you have access
to the full names, email address and other contact information of the project supporter and
as a supporter you have access to the full name, email address and other contact
information of the creator. 
<br><br>
By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' personal
information that you obtain through the Site or through a Pozible-related communication or
Pozible-facilitated transaction, Pozible hereby grants to you a license to use such
information only for: 
<br><br>
Pozible-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, using cobranded
services offered through Pozible (e.g. insurance, shipping and fraud complaints),
and any other purpose that such user expressly opts into after adequate disclosure of the
purpose(s). 
<br><br>
In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your database
and a chance to review what information you have collected about them. In addition, under
no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personal information
about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other
user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights
holders are given different rights with respect to information they access. 
<br><br>
We and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are
not licensed to add a Pozible user, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to
your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate
disclosure. To report spam from other Pozible users, please send an email to <a href="mailto:admin@pozible.com">admin@pozible.com</a>. 
<br><br>
<b>6. Use of Email Tools</b>
You may not use the send a message service or other email forwarding services that we
offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement or
Privacy Policy. 
<br><br>
<b>7. Control of Your Password</b>
You are responsible for all actions taken with your password, including fees. Therefore we
do not recommend that you disclose your Pozible password to any third parties. If you
choose to share your password or your information with third parties to provide you
additional services, you agree that you are responsible for all actions taken with your
password and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose
control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information
and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your
password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
password as detailed in Section 8. 
<br><br>
<b>8. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information</b>
Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during
registration including: 
<br><br>
Your registration information such as: name, company, address, city, state, post code,
country, primary phone number, secondary phone number, fax number and gender. 
<br><br>
Your password (if you have supplied such information). 
<br><br>
You must promptly update your personal information if it changes. Once posted, you
cannot change or remove any public postings made in our forums or other message areas
or the feedback area. 
<br><br>
Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, and financial
information from our active databases. To make this request, email the
<a href="mailto:admin@pozible.com">admin@pozible.com</a>. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible
in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. 
<br><br>
We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some
circumstances, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist
with any investigations, and enforce our User Agreement, and to comply with legal
requirements. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our
databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems.
Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely
removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such information will
be deactivated from public viewing and usage by other members of Pozible and will only
be available to select Pozible personnel. 
<br><br>
<b>9. Other Information Collectors</b>
Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only
addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that
you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are project creators or project
supporters on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to
their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that
we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies.
Since Pozible does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the
privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose
your personal information to others.
