    <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Posu.me, Inc. allows users to purchase mobile advertisements on participating ad networks, exchanges, publishers, applications and web sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes:  (a) how Posu.me, Inc. (“we” or “us” or “our”) collects information from you and other users of our services, applications, and third party websites with whom we engage (“publishers”); (b) how we use that information to enrich your web experience; and (c) when we share that information with our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that Posu.me, Inc. services enhance our users’ web experience. If you do not want us to collect any further information from you via our ad delivery process, then you may choose to opt-out via <a href="http://optout.pocketmath.com">optout.pocketmath.com</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">A. ABOUT THIS POLICY</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy governs our use and disclosure of information that we collect when you visit a website that directly or indirectly uses the Posu.me services, or view advertisements we serve. This Privacy Policy does not otherwise apply to the practices of other websites, such as those of our publishers and advertiser clients, or other services or companies that we do not own, manage or control. We do not control the privacy practices of such third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties when you use their services.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">B. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY POSU.ME, INC.</h3>
    <p>
      As we explain in more detail below, we may collect information about you in the following ways: when you complete a registration form; when you use or interact with Posu.me services; when you install or use the Posu.me Passport plugin; when you visit a website that directly or indirectly uses the Posu.me services; or when you view or respond to advertisements served by us or on our behalf.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h6>Direct Information</h6>
        <p>
          We collect “Direct Information,” which means any information that you directly give us.  For example, by registering with us, you will be directly giving us certain information, some of which identifies you personally, such as your name, email address, and other registration information. From time to time, you may also directly give us additional information about yourself if you engage in any other transactions with us, such as when you give us your phone number to seek customer support.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Usage Information</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>
            We collect “Usage Information,” such as general click stream behavior, web pages viewed (including the URL addresses and content of such pages), search queries from which you are directed to a page, navigation from page to page through our publisher networks, time spent on each page, items that you click or select, IP address, cookie-based information, information about your geographic location (e.g., derived from your IP address), and your Internet Service Provider.
          </strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Technical Information</h6>
        <p>
          We also collect “Technical information,” such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the central processing unit on your computer, and your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Information from Third Parties</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Together with the information that we collect from you, we may combine non personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic information such as zip code) that we receive from our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties. For example, we may also receive publicly available information from third party websites with whom you have registered (e.g., social networks).
          </strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">C. INFORMATION USED BY POSU.ME, INC.</h3>
    <p>
      We may use your Direct Information to: (a) fulfill requests for our services; (b) communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; (c) conduct research about the use of the Posu.me, Inc. services; (d) enable you to create an account, store log-in credentials, and customize your access and use of Posu.me, Inc. services; (e) contact you from time to time about Posu.me, Inc. services; and (f) provide offers for products and services of Posu.me, Inc. and our partners, publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties that may be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use the Direct Information, Usage Information and/or Technical Information that we collect (alone or in combination with information that we receive from our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties) to assemble non-personal, demographic and behavioral information to group users that share a common interest into “Audience Segments.” These Audience Segments do not contain personally identifiable information; for example, these segments may disclose that a user located in a geographic area may be interested in cars, but these segments do not identify or include the name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, or user name of any specific individual. We may use these Audience Segments to:  (a) match advertisements that may be of interest to our users that fall within that segment; and (b) assist our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties to deliver advertisements and offers that may be of interest to users within a given segment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, if you have chosen to make personally identifiable information (e.g., your name) publicly available through third party websites (e.g., social networks), we may seek your consent to use that personally identifiable information in connection with services that we offer in conjunction with our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        We and our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties also use such information for other related purposes (e.g., research to better understand the results of our online advertising campaigns or the interests or activities of users of the Posu.me, Inc. services). We may also be engaged by any publisher that uses the Posu.me, Inc. services to collect Usage Information on such publisher’s websites, such as for the purpose of obtaining additional information about such publisher’s own users and in accordance with such publisher’s privacy policy (rather than for our independent purposes).
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use Technical Information to analyze your browsing patterns and content, in order to personalize and target ads to you.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">D. SHARING INFORMATION</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h6>Direct Information</h6>
        <p>
          We do not sell Direct Information, nor do we share any Direct Information (including any Direct Information combined with other Usage Information or Technical Information) with any third party for marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose any information we collect, including your personally identifiable information, if:  (a) you specifically authorize it (e.g., you respond to an offer made by a third party on the Posu.me services or you use our social media services); or (b) we reasonably believe that we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of the public or any user.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Information Shared for Advertising</h6>
        <p>
          We use non-personally identifiable Direct Information, Usage Information (e.g., Audience Segments) and/or Technical Information with third party advertisers and publishers to assist us and them in delivering relevant, personalized advertising that is aligned with user interests. For example, these companies may use such information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that are likely to be of greater interest to you. Your preferences collected through this process may be used to influence a selection of types of marketing messages that you receive across websites of our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that our publishers’ websites and their independent advertisers may independently collect other demographical information about you after they place their own cookies or web beacons on publishers’ websites. The use of cookies and pixel tags by our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties are subject to their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the information practices of these third parties.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">E. YOUR OPTIONS</h3>
    <p>
      Periodically, you may click the “Incognito” button to “hide” yourself for a limited period of time, so that we will disable (during such time) our tracking of your additional Usage Information for targeting purposes, but you will continue to receive advertisements tailored to your preferences and usage. This “Incognito” option applies only to Posu.me’s tracking feature <strong>and does not apply to cookies or web beacons that are used by our publishers, advertiser clients and other third parties.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Internet browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. If you prefer, you may configure your Internet browser to refuse cookies, but you may not be able to receive certain benefits of Posu.me if you do so.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">F. BE CAREFUL IF YOU POST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever you voluntarily post information in public areas of websites operated by Posu.me, Inc. or the Internet (e.g., journals, blogs, message boards, and forums), you should be aware that this information may be accessed by the public. Please exercise discretion in deciding what information you disclose.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">G. AUTHORITY</h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">H. ACQUISITIONS</h3>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to transfer your information (e.g., personally identifiable information) in the event of a transfer of ownership of Posu.me, Inc. and/or its relevant assets, such as acquisition by or merger with a different company. If the different company plans to materially change this Privacy Policy, you will be notified beforehand.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">I. SECURITY</h3>
    <p>
      We implement physical, electronic and procedural restrictions (e.g., password protection), in an effort to help protect confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. Please remember that no technological environment is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee confidentiality of any communication or information posted or otherwise transmitted on Posu.me or any other website over the Internet.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="subheader">J. CHANGES IN PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
    <p>
      From time to time, we may change this Privacy Policy by posting a notice of such change on our website. You should visit our website periodically to review any such change. When you continue to use or interact with Posu.me services after such change, your subsequent provision of information (e.g., personally identifiable information) to us will be subject to such change. If such change materially expands our rights to use your personally identifiable information that we have collected, we will notify you through email or a prominent posting on our website.
    </p>
