**Dow Jones Local Media Group Privacy Policy  
Effective as of July 6, 2011**

## INTRODUCTION:

This Privacy Policy describes how Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc. ("DJLMG," "us" or "we"), publisher of Pocono Record and poconorecord.com, will collect and use your personally identifiable information ("PII") (that is -- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) as well as data that can, under certain circumstances, indirectly lead to PII ("Related Data"). 

This Policy applies to PII and Related Data received by us from consumers when they visit, register or subscribe to the online editions of poconorecord.com, and related services or sites that link to this Privacy Policy. 

From time to time DJLMG may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII or Related Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII or Related Data, your PII and Related Data will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes. 

## INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT:

**Generally.** When you subscribe to our products or services, we collect PII and Related Information from you. We also may collect PII and Related Information from you when you contact us about your subscriptions or participate in activities like: our resume database; job searches; submitting a letter to the editor; submitting a photo for inclusion in galleries; placing a classified advertisement; commenting on articles; or surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or games. When you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you. 

We do not, however, knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen. 

When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. 

**Cookies.** Cookies are small bits of information that our web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies (including browser cookies and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) to, among other things, facilitate our login processes; allow you to personalize and store your settings; collect usage information; determine our total audience size and traffic; and help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to users. 

Third party advertisements displayed on our sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. We do not control these cookies and visitors to our web sites should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. (See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertisements). 

You can set the browser on your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>. However, by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features on our web sites. 

We also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we include web beacons and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened. 

When you view an ad for our publications on other sites, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. We and our advertising company may also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts. 

We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our web sites may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if we wish to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent. 

**Third Party Ad Servers.** Some of the advertisements and other services that appear on our web site(s) are delivered to you by Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our sites and other web sites. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

## NOTICE

Third Party Web Sites. Our web sites link to web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Pocono Record, poconorecord.com or other DJLMG logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example, the HudsonValley.com section of poconorecord.com offers a collection of third party services, such as career counseling, reference checks, recruiter databases and other services, through such links. 

We're not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our sites or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you've left our site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. 

Our web sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with us (i.e., that are part of the News America Group ("Affiliated Companies"). Although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News America corporate [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), visitors to those Affiliated Company sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. 

Resume Database/Job Alerts. HudsonValley.com/jobs offers you the opportunity to create a resume and store it on our resume database. When you store your resume on our system, you can choose one of the following options: 

  * You can designate your resume as "Private" which means that your resume will not be shared with employers or recruiters unless you apply directly for a job.
  * You can designate your resume as "Confidential" which means that you can hide your contact information, but allow your resume to be searchable and viewable by employers or recruiters. Should you elect not to share your contact information with employers, but to allow your resume to be searchable, we send emails from interested recruiters or employers to you but will not reveal your email address to those recruiters or employers.
  * You can designate your resume as "Public" which means you allow your resume, including your name and contact information, to be searchable and viewable by employers or recruiters.



IF YOU ELECT TO MAKE YOUR RESUME VIEWABLE BY EMPLOYERS, ALL INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) THAT YOU INCLUDE IN YOUR RESUME MAY BE VIEWED BY RECRUITERS AND EMPLOYERS. YOU SHOULD NOT ENTER ANY INFORMATION IN THE BODY OF YOUR RESUME THAT YOU WISH TO REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. 

We do not screen the credentials of employers or recruiters before allowing them to conduct searches in our database. Dow Jones is not responsible for the retention, use or privacy practices of that employer or recruiter after it has received your information. 

You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, third parties who accessed the database or obtained a copy of your resume may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances. 

[HudsonValley.com/jobs](http://www.hudsonvalley.com/jobs) offers you the opportunity to sign up for job search alerts. If you would like to review, change or delete your resume or job search alert, you can do so by [signing in here](http://pocono.careers.adicio.com/careers/jobseeker) and following directions to edit.
