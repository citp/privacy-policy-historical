LPA reserves the right to disclose the information collected by and through this Site, including your Personally Identifiable Information, as required by law and when LPA believes that such disclosure is necessary (i) to protect LPA's rights, a third party's rights, or the rights of the public at large; or (ii) to comply with a judicial proceeding, subpoena, court order or other legal process served on LPA.  The disclosure of this information may be without notice to you.
