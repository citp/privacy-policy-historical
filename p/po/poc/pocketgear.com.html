<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy will tell
      you what information we collect; how we collect it, how we use it, how
      we disclose it, how we protect it, and what choices you have with
      respect to all of the above. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy so
      that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy,
  and how you can participate in that commitment.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs the information collection and
      disclosure practices for the web sites operated by Appia GmbH
      (collectively, the "Company", or "we" or "us"). The Company's web sites
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, all of the following web
      sites, each of which is operated (either directly or through one or more
      wholly-owned subsidiaries) by the Company:
      www.palmgear.com,classic.Appia.com, www.Appia.com,
      www.smartphone.net, www.symbiangear.com, www.androidgear.com,
      www.rimgear.com, www.mobile2day.com, and www.mobile2day.de (each a "Web
  Site" and collectively the "Web Sites").</p>
<h3>1. Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time,
      so please review it regularly. If we make changes to this Privacy
      Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Web Sites and
      other places we deem appropriate. All such changes shall be binding on
      you 30 days after they are initially posted on the Web Sites unless you
  are a new user, in which case they are binding on you immediately.</p>
<h3>2. Information Collection</h3>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>General.</strong> In general, you can browse the Web Sites
        without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information
        about yourself. However, if you wish to purchase or download any of
        the products or use any of the services offered by the Web Sites, you
        may be required to disclose certain information to us. You always have
        the option to not provide information by choosing not to purchase or
        download a particular product or use a particular service or feature.
        The Company is the sole owner of the information collected on the Web
    Site.</li>
  <li><strong>Registration.</strong> In order to use, purchase or download
        certain products or services offered by this Web Site, you may be
        required to first create an account with us. You may have to establish
        a separate account if you use the services or purchase or download
        products from more than one Web Site. During the account set-up
        process, you are required to give certain contact information,
        including but not limited to your name, email address, and in some
        cases your approximate age. We use this information to contact you
        about the products services on our site in which you have expressed
        interest, and, the case of your approximate age, to determine whether
        you old enough to use the Web Sites. You may have the option to
        provide additional demographic information (such as income level,
        location, and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this
        information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on
        our site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and
    which fields are optional.</li>
  <li><strong>Orders.</strong> If you purchase or download a product or
        service from us, we may request certain personally identifiable
        information from you on our order form. You must provide contact
        information (such as name, email, and address) and, where applicable,
        financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
        We use this information for billing purposes and to fulfill your
        orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this
    information to contact you.</li>
  <li><strong>Surveys or Contests.</strong> From time-to-time we may provide
        you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Web
        Sites. If you participate, we will request certain personally
        identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or
        contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice
        whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information
        typically includes contact information (such as name and email
        address), and demographic information. We use this information to
        notify contest winners and to award prizes. We may use a third party
    service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.</li>
  <li><strong>Log Files.</strong> As is true of most web sites, we gather
        certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
        information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
        Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
        system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
        information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze
        trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the
        site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
        whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally
    identifiable information.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small text file that is stored
        on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on
        this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any
        personally identifiable information you submit while on our site,
        unless you have elected to have the Web Site "remember" you, in which
        case the cookie will be linked to your user name. We may use both
        session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session ID
        cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID
        cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie
        remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can
        remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
        Internet browser's "help" file. We set a persistent cookie to store
        your password, so you don't have to enter it more than once.
        Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of
        our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject
        cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
        areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. This
        Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by this Web Site only and
        does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third parties.
        See the sections on "Third Party Advertisers" and "Co-Branded Pages"
    below. We may also use a third-party tracking service that uses
    cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about
    visitors to our site in the aggregate. We do not control the use of
    cookies by third parties.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).</strong> We may employ or
        our third party advertising partner may employ a software technology
        called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs) that help us better
        manage content on or about the Web Sites by informing us what content
        is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,
        similar in function to cookies that are used to track the online
        movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a
        user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web
        pages or in HTML-based emails and are about the size of the period at
        the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by
        clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. We
        may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which
        emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the
        effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our
    marketing campaigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Correspondence.</strong> If you send us personal
        correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third
        parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on
        the Web Sites, we may collect such information into a file specific to
    you.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Advertisers.</strong> Ads appearing on this Web
        Site may be delivered to users by a third party advertising partner.
        We may share Web Site usage information about users with our
        advertising partners for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner
        advertisements on this site. Such information will not be linked to
        personally identifiable information. Our advertising partners may use
        cookies and/or clear GIFs, which allow them to recognize a user when a
    user visits this Web Site.</li>
  <li><strong>Co-Branded Pages.</strong> In some cases, third party web sites
        may have a "look and feel" similar to one of the Web Sites, and these
        third party web sites may even be bordered ("framed") by content from
        the Web Sites, but any information collected by such web sites is
        collected by the third party operator of that site. These sites are
        usually identified by a "Powered by" or similar logo identifying the
        third party operator of the linked site. Information collection on
        those sites is governed by the privacy policy posted on those sites.
        In some cases, the third party operator may share the information with
        us, in which case this Privacy Policy will govern our use of that
    information.</li>
  <li><strong>Supplementation of Information.</strong> In order to provide
        certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal
        information you submitted to us with information from third party
    sources.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Use of Information</h3>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Generally.</strong> We use your personal information to fulfill
        orders and to facilitate the services you purchase or request from us.
        We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you,
        and other information we obtain from your current and past activities
        on the Web Sites to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; collect
        fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services,
        inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and
        updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against
        error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our Terms and
        Conditions of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the time of
        collection. We may compare and review your personal information for
    errors, omissions and for accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Communications from Us.</strong>
    <ol type="i">
      <li><i>Special Offers and Updates.</i> We will occasionally
            send you information on special deals or promotions. Out of respect
            for your privacy, you have the option not to receive these types of
        communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</li>
      <li><i>Newsletters.</i> If you wish to subscribe to our
            newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send the
            newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you have the
            option to unsubscribe from receiving some or all of the newsletters.
        Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</li>
      <li><i>Service-related Announcements.</i> We will send you
            strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is
            necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily
            suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally,
            you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not
            promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have
        the option to deactivate your account.</li>
      <li><i>Customer Service.</i> Based upon the personally
            identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a
            welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also
            communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the
        services you request, and to manage your account.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Profile.</strong> We store information that we collect through
        your stated preferences, cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third
        party sources to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your
        personally identifiable information, and your activity history, to
        information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions
        and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.
        We do not share your profile with other third parties, other than in
    aggregate, de-identified form.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Disclosure of Information</h3>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Generally.</strong> As a matter of policy, we do not sell or
        rent any of your personal information to third parties for their
        marketing purposes without first providing you with an opportunity to
        opt-out. However, the following describes some of the ways that we may
        disclose your personal information in the normal course of providing
    our services.</li>
  <li><strong>Suppliers &amp; Developers.</strong> Where you purchase or
        download a product or service on one of our Web Sites, we may disclose
        your name and email address to our partner who is our supplier of that
        product or service. For example, if you download a particular software
        application, we may disclose your name and email address to the
        developer of that software application. This disclosure is to enable
        the developer or supplier to provide support to you, and in certain
        cases to allow you to benefit from certain levels of support that are
        only available to registered users. We have no control over what these
    third parties do with the information that we disclose to them.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable).</strong> We share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our
        user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not
    identify individual users.</li>
  <li><strong>Agents and Service Providers.</strong> We may use third parties
        to provide, on our behalf, some portions of the products and services
        available on the Web Sites. For instance, we use a credit card
        processing company to bill you for services, and we may use third
        party service providers to provide certain fulfillment services for
        some of our products or services. We use our best efforts, to the
        extent commercially reasonable, to ensure that these companies do not
        retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that
    we disclose to them for such purposes for any other purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Your Use of the Web Site.</strong> If you participate in a
        bulletin board or other public forum offered by the Web Sites, your
        User ID will be displayed on any content that you post and will
        therefore be available to the public. Therefore, if you associate your
        name with your User ID, your name will be available to the public. Any
        other information about yourself that you include in such posts will
    be publicly available.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Requests.</strong> We reserve the right to disclose your
        personally identifiable information as required by law and when we
        believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to
        comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process
    served on our Web Sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Disclaimer.</strong> We cannot ensure that all of your private
        communications and other personal information will never be disclosed
        in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of
        example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
        personal information to the government or third parties under certain
        circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
        transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse
    your personal information that they collect from the Web Sites.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Choice / Opt-Out</h3>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your
      personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we
      ask for this information. For example, if you no longer wish to receive
      our newsletters and promotional communications, you may opt-out of
      receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter
      or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Appia.com">privacy@Appia.com</a>. You
      may also update your preferences at any time by accessing our member
      information area. You will be notified before your personal information
      is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider,
      so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your
  information with that party.</p>
<h3>6. Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by
      these Web Sites. The Web Sites contain links to other sites that are not
      owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible
      for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be
      aware of when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
      each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
  information.</p>
<h3>7. Access to Personal Information</h3>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no
      longer desire some or all of our services, you may correct, update,
      delete or deactivate it by making the change on our account information
      pages or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Appia.com">privacy@Appia.com</a> or by contacting us by postal mail Appia Deutschland GmbH,
      Truderinger Str. 273, D-81825 Munich, Germany. Please note that, if you
      have established an account with more than one of our Web Sites, you may
  have to make these changes on each Web Site.</p>
<h3>8. Security</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
      When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or
      social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt
      that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow
      generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
      information submitted to us from unauthorized access, disclosure,
      alteration, or destruction, both during transmission and once we receive
  it.</p>
<h3>9. Business Transition</h3>
<p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a
      merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of
      our assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be
  among the assets transferred.</p>
