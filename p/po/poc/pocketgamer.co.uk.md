STORING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We will only retain and use your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes set out in this privacy
policy or as otherwise required by law.
Unfortunately the sending of information via the internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information can be
intercepted. We cannot guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically and therefore sending
such information is entirely at your own risk but once received, all information is stored on our secure servers and we
have in place a level of security appropriate to the nature of the information stored and the harm that might result from a
breach of security.
The information that we collect from you may be transferred to a destination outside the European Economic Area
("EEA"), where it will be stored by us or by one of our suppliers. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such suppliers and staff may be engaged in, among other things, the
provision of support services. We will take reasonable steps to ensure adequate security for any of your information
transferred outside the EEA, but please be aware that destinations outside the EEA to which your information may be
transferred may have data protection laws which do not offer the same level of protection for your information as those in
force in the EEA. By using our site and submitting your information to us, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing
of such information outside the EEA as set out in this privacy policy. By using the website and submitting your personal
information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of such personal information outside the EEA as set out in
this privacy policy
                                                             2


DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION
We may share your personal data with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding
company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006 ("Group").
We will not disclose your personal information to any other party other than in accordance with this privacy policy and in
the circumstances detailed below:
          1.    We may disclose your personal data to our subcontractors and other suppliers and service providers who
                we engage to assist with our administrative or business functions and to deal with any other matters in
                connection with our sites, our events and services and any agreements we enter into with you.
          2.    We may disclose your personal data to analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the
                improvement and optimisation of our site.
          3.    We may disclose your personal data to advertisers and advertising networks that require anonymised data
                to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We may provide them with aggregate information
                about our users (for example, we may inform them that 100 women aged 18-30 have clicked on their
                advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the
                kind of audience they want to target (for example, men in a particular location). We may make use of the
                information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying
                their advertisement to that target audience.
          4.    In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the
                prospective seller or buyer.
          5.    If Steel Media Limited, or substantially all of its or their assets, are acquired by a third party, in which case
                personal data held by it about its or their clients/users may be one of the transferred assets.
          6.    If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or
                in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights,
                property, or safety of Steel Media Limited or any member of the company or others.
          7.    Where we have obtained explicit consent from you, at time of entry or order, to disclose your contact details
                to other event attendees, competition and event sponsors.
THIRD PARTY LINKS
This privacy policy only covers Steel Media owned sites. On occasion we include links to third parties on our sites. Where
we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site's policy towards visitor privacy. You should review
their privacy policy and consider their reputation before sending them any personal data.
OPTING OUT OF MARKETING
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. If you would like to do so, just let
us know using our contact details at the end of this privacy policy. However, if you exercise your right to opt-out of
receiving marketing messages from us, please be aware that you may continue to receive certain non-marketing
