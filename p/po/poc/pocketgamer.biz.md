To do this, we send your email address to Facebook in "hashed" form, which means we convert it into a string of numbers that cannot be reversed to reveal your email address. When Facebook receives the hashed data, it matches it against its own list of hashed data and if it has a hash which corresponds to your email address it will present our advertisement to you.

Such suppliers and staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.
