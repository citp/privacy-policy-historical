# Privacy - P&O Cruises

### P&O Cruises General Privacy Statement

Carnival plc is a publicly listed company in the United Kingdom. Carnival plc, trading as P&O Cruises, has registered branches in Australia (ABN 23 107 998 443 2TA 5580), and New Zealand.

These branches (collectively referred to as “we”, “us”, “our” or “P&O Cruises”) are subject to the National Privacy Principles introduced under Australian privacy legislation and the Information Privacy Principles introduced under New Zealand privacy legislation.

We hereby set out a summary of how we manage your personal information. We believe that our policy not only complies with relevant legislation in Australia and New Zealand but also represents industry best practice.

#### Collection

The core functions of our business (ie. the primary purposes for which we collect personal information) are to facilitate the booking, carriage, marketing and administration of our various cruise products. We will not collect personal information unless it is necessary for one or more of these functions or a related activity.

The information will be collected lawfully and fairly, and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. We may collect personal information about you when you deal with us in person or over the phone, send us correspondence (by letter, email or fax) or visit one of our web sites. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that when collecting personal information you are aware of:

  * who we are and how to contact us;
  * the fact that you are able to gain access to the personal information we have collected about you;
  * the purpose for our collecting the personal information;
  * the organisations to which we would normally disclose that personal information;
  * any law that requires the personal information to be collected; and
  * what the consequences may be if the personal information is not provided.



As far as it is reasonably possible, we will collect your personal information directly from you. If this is not possible and personal information is collected from someone else (eg. a travel agent), we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the matters listed above, unless specific exemptions apply. Sensitive information will only be collected with your consent, unless specific legislative exemptions apply.

#### Use and Disclosure

Our general rule is that we will not use or disclose your personal information other than for the purpose stated at the time of collection. If another use is proposed, we will seek your further consent unless that other purpose is related to the original purpose of collection (the “secondary purpose”). For example, you could reasonably expect us to use or disclose your personal information collected from your booking form for the secondary purpose of sending you information about your automatic entitlements to special offers, potential discounts as a past passenger and any special promotions that are on offer.

Whilst we retain various third parties to assist us in our marketing and promotional activities (eg. to administer our “eDeals" email service and to maintain an off-site database for information concerning our past passengers), we do not disclose your personal information to anyone else for their promotional use. Similarly, we are not in the practice of purchasing mailing lists (whether post or email) from third parties for our promotional use.

Any promotional information that we send to you (by post or by email) will contain instructions for how you can easily opt out of receiving further notifications. We seek written assurances from parties to whom we may disclose personal information to ensure that they will treat that information in accordance with our privacy policy.

#### Data Quality

We will reasonably ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. We encourage you to contact us if you believe personal information we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete in some way. When the information is no longer needed, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify that information.

#### Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure in accordance with industry standards. This includes stringent security measures on board our vessels, physical security for our offices in Australia and New Zealand and electronic security (such as password access, encryption and firewalls) for our office network servers and electronic data transfers.

#### Openness

We have documented policies on our management of personal information that we are happy to make available on request.

#### Access and Correction

Generally, we will give you access to the personal information we have collected about you and we may correct it at your request. If we do not grant your request for access to or for a correction of personal information we have collected about you, we will provide you with a written explanation of the reasons for our decision.

#### Identifiers

We will not use any government or other agency’s identifier (such as your Medicare or tax file number) as our own identifier to link you with your personal information.

#### Anonymity

Where lawful and practical, we will give you the option of not identifying yourself when dealing with us. For example, at the completion of your cruise we will request that you provide us with specific feedback on our cruise facilities on an anonymous basis.

#### Transborder Data Flows

Personal information concerning New Zealand passengers will be transferred to and from our Australian and New Zealand branches. We will only transfer your personal information to another foreign country with less privacy protection in specified circumstances. For example, the primary server for our reservations database, to which our staff have remote but secure access, is located in Los Angeles. This primary server is maintained by Princess Cruise Lines Limited (“Princess Cruises”), a company incorporated in the United States that is another wholly owned subsidiary of Carnival plc. Although the United States is yet to introduce privacy legislation, Princess Cruises are taking measures to ensure that they will meet the requirements of data protection legislation introduced in the United Kingdom. The UK legislation is generally considered to be even more stringent than its Australian or New Zealand counterparts.
