# Privacy Policy - P&O Cruises

Legal Information

Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc (collectively referred to as "Carnival") operate under a dual listed company structure with primary stock exchange listings in the United States and the United Kingdom. Carnival is a global cruise business with a portfolio of leading cruise brands, including P&O Cruises Australia, Princess Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Holland America Line, Seabourn, Cunard Line, P&O World Cruises, AIDA,  Costa and Iberocruceros (‘Carnival brands’).

Carnival plc, has registered branches in Australia (ABN 23 107 998 443, 2TA 5580) and New Zealand Company number 1471215. These branches trade under various brand names, including P&O Cruises and are subject to the National Privacy Principles introduced under Australian privacy legislation and the Information Privacy Principles introduced under New Zealand privacy legislation. In this policy, “we”, “us”, “our” means Carnival plc trading as P&O Cruises Australia. 

In this policy, we set out a summary of how we manage your personal information. You should also refer to P&O Cruises passage terms and conditions for further details on some of the personal information we may need to collect, use or disclose as part of your cruise holiday.  

Collection

The core functions of our business (i.e. the primary purposes for which we collect personal information) are to facilitate the booking, carriage, marketing and administration of our various cruise products and those of other Carnival brands. 

So that we can carry out these functions, and provide you with our products and services, we may ask you to provide us with personal information, including (but not limited to) your personal contact details, your passport and driver’s licence details, next of kin and emergency contact information, payment information (e.g. your credit card details), information relating to your health and dietary requirements (if any) and your proposed travel and tour arrangements.

Some examples of where we may need this information are to:  
• process your booking and carriage aboard our cruise ships;  
• create and process insurance policies;  
• assess your health and provide medical assistance (if needed);   
• handle and respond to complaints; and  
• provide your details to immigration officials. 

We may collect personal information about you in a variety of ways including when you deal with us in person or over the phone, send us correspondence (by letter, email or fax) or visit one of our web sites or when we receive personal information about you from other Carnival brands (in accordance with their applicable  privacy policies).

We will not collect personal information unless it is reasonably necessary for one or more of our core business functions or a related activity.

As far as it is reasonably possible, we will collect your personal information directly from you. If this is not possible and personal information is collected from someone else (eg. a travel agent), we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the matters listed above, unless specific exemptions apply. Sensitive information will only be collected with your consent, unless specific legislative exemptions apply.

Please note that passengers may have their photos taken in public areas by cruise ship staff.  Once developed, the photos are publicly displayed in photo galleries for purchase by passengers.  At the end of the cruise, all unsold photos are bagged and incinerated.  As with all other personal information, photos identifying individuals will be handled in accordance with our obligations under privacy legislation. 

You have no obligation to provide any information requested by us.  However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with the products, services and assistance that depend on the collection of that information. 

Use and Disclosure

Our general rule is that we will not use or disclose your personal information other than for the primary purpose for which it is collected, which may be as stated above or at the time of collection. If another use is proposed, we will seek your further consent unless that other purpose is related to the original purpose of collection (the "secondary purpose"). For example, you could reasonably expect us to use or disclose your personal information collected from your booking form for the secondary purpose of us and other Carnival brands sending you information about special offers and potential discounts.

Where you consent to receiving promotional material from us, you consent to receiving promotional information from all of the Carnival brands and agree that we may share your personal information with other Carnival brands for that purpose. Any promotional information that we send to you (by post or by email) will contain instructions for how you can opt out of receiving further notifications.

Whilst we may retain various third parties to assist us in our marketing and promotional activities (eg. to administer our direct marketing activities and to maintain an off-site database for information concerning our past passengers) we do not disclose your personal information to anyone outside Carnival for their promotional use. However, we may disclose your personal information to third parties (including our agents and contractors) in order to:  
• process and administer information to facilitate your dealings with Carnival;  
• develop processes, products or services that might better meet our customers’ needs;  
• enable third parties to whom we outsource specialised functions (such as mailing houses, printing companies, data processors, data analysts, data washing and research companies) to perform their role; and  
• transfer data if a Carnival asset is sold or transferred to a new owner.

We seek written assurances from any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information to ensure that they will treat that information in accordance with applicable privacy laws.

If we have reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health or we are required to provide information in response to subpoenas, warrants or other legal processes including police enquiries, or enquiries from another government department (including, without limitation, Customs and Immigration), we will disclose your information for those purposes without seeking your consent. 

Data Quality

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. We encourage you to contact us if you believe personal information we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete in some way. 

Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure in accordance with industry standards. This includes stringent security measures on board our vessels, physical security for our offices in Australia and New Zealand and electronic security (such as password access, encryption and firewalls) for our office network servers and electronic data transfers.

Identifiers

We will not use any government or other agency's identifier (such as your Medicare or tax file number) as our own identifier to link you with your personal information.

Anonymity

Where lawful and practical, we will give you the option of not identifying yourself when dealing with us. For example, at the completion of your cruise we will request that you provide us with specific feedback on our cruise facilities on an anonymous basis.

Transborder Data Flows

We may transfer your personal information between the various offices of Carnival Corporation and plc (which may, for example, involve the transfer of personal information between our Australian and New Zealand offices).  We may also transfer your personal information to other Carnival brands or third parties (as described in the “Use and Disclosure” section above) who are outside of Australia or New Zealand, but we will only do so if we reasonably believe that they are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which upholds principles for fair handling of information that are substantially similar to the privacy laws in Australia and New Zealand, or we are otherwise permitted under applicable privacy laws to do so. 

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)

To ensure the security and safety of our passengers, CCTV cameras have been installed and operate aboard our cruise ships.  CCTV operates through the use of dedicated cameras to transmit a video image to a specific set of monitors. Access to the images shown on these monitors is available to authorised persons only.  CCTV recordings are generally retained for a period of 21 days, and then deleted permanently unless retained as records of an incident. The operation of CCTV cameras is limited to public access areas only, such as around pools and areas where children are located.  Cameras have not been installed in private areas, such as toilets and change rooms. 

For more information about the operation of CCTV aboard our cruise ships, please contact Customer Service as described below.
