      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>This policy covers how IC Group treats personal information
      that we collect and receive through our Pobox.com and
      Listbox.com web sites.  Personal information is information
      about you that is personally identifiable, such as your
      name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is
      not otherwise publicly available.</p>

      <h3>Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>When you register with us, we ask for your name, mailing
      address, telephone numbers, and a security question of your
      choosing.  We collect, store, and use this personal
      information to confirm your identity when you contact us,
      and to contact you regarding your account.  We also use
      cookies as described below.</p>

      <p>If you do not provide that information accurately, you reduce our
      ability to confirm your identity as the account holder.  If you feel
      very strongly about this matter, we urge you to fill in the security
      question and answer (in <a href="http://pobox.com/login/personal/question">the Personal
      Information section of the User's Area</a>) and to <strong>remember the
      answer</strong>.  IC Group is not liable for any changes made to your
      account as a result of our inability to confirm your identity.</p>

      <p>Because we do not derive income from advertising, we do not
      aggregate your personal information for marketing purposes.
      However, we may use your data to determine some basic 
      information about our user base (for example, how many
      customers do we have in a particular country.)</p>
      
      <p>We do not sell, loan, lease, give away, share or in any
      other way make your personal information or your Pobox
      address available to parties other than IC Group,
      Inc. and its affiliates, except:</p>

      <ul class="text_only">
        <li>when you have given us permission (example: to deal
        with another company on your behalf);</li>
        <li>when you have violated our <a href="http://www.pobox.com/user_agreement/">Terms of Service</a>, and
        misused your Pobox account for spam or other
        prohibited uses;</li>

        <li>in the event of a merger or a transfer of all or
        substantially all our assets to a third party,
        provided that we will notify you before personal
        information becomes subject to a different privacy
        policy; and</li>

        <li>to comply with law or legal process (subpoenas), or
        to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
        against legal claims.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If your information has been subpoenaed from us, you will be
      informed unless we are specifically barred from doing so by
      the subpoena.</p>

      <h3>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</h3>
      <p>You can access and edit your account information at any time (in fact,
      we encourage you to keep this information up to date, so that we do
      not we try to call you and find the phone number disconnected).  Your
      personal information can be edited at <a href="https://www.pobox.com/login/personal">the Personal Information section of the User's Area.</a></p>
      <p>Your account can be canceled at any time by responding to
      invoices with "cancel", or by contacting our Customer
      Service staff at <a title="Send an email to Pobox Support" href="mailto:pobox@pobox.com">pobox@pobox.com</a>.  
      If you ask us to delete
      your account, your account will usually be deactivated and
      deleted from our user registration database within 1 hour.
      Please note that information may remain in back-up storage
      for some further period of time.</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
      protect personal information about you; however we cannot
      guarantee that someone won't be able to circumvent these
      safeguards.  These safeguards include, but are not limited
      to, mandating password protection for all accounts,
      confirming that a request to send personal information or
      passwords to email addresses not listed in an account was
      submitted by a person authorized to do so for that account,
      encrypting credit card and password information within our
      system, and taking measures to protect our servers,
      databases and other system components against intrusions,
      tampering, and other attacks.</p>

      <h3>Advertising</h3>
      <p>We do not sell advertising space on any of our websites.
      You may see notices about our own products, but we do not
      use your eyeballs to make money.</p>

      <p>We also do not distribute ads by email, either to Pobox subscribers or
      through our mailing lists.  We do not even tell you about our own
      products, unless you have asked us to, or there is a change that will
      affect, or has affected, your service (recent examples include the
      @Home outage and changes to SMTP service).</p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>We <strong>do</strong> use cookies.  Why?  It's the simplest way,
      technically, to allow you to use our website.  We know that
      it would be possible to run the site without cookies, but it
      is a needless complication.  Here's what our cookies do: 

      </p><ul class="text_only">
        <li>If you check the box that says "Remember my username
        in the future", we put a cookie on your machine that
        does exactly that.  It doesn't expire, because it
        would be useless if it did.</li>
        <li>If you don't check that box, you will get a cookie
        once your password has been authorized.  It will
        authorize your browser to make changes to your account
        for up to an hour, at which point it will expire.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not issue third-party cookies.  You will most likely
      receive cookies from one of these 3 domains: pobox.com,
      listbox.com and icgroup.com (our parent company.)</p>

      <h3>Customer Service and System Maintenance</h3>
      <p>All messages sent to our customer service department are
      saved indefinitely, and become our property.  If you contact
      Customer Service, we reserve the right to change your
      account settings or send email to your account in order to
      solve the problem.  You may also receive test emails if we
      detect a problem with your account, even if you have not
      contacted us.</p>

      <h3>Anonymity</h3>
      <p>Pobox.com is not an anonymous remailer.  Your forwarding
      address may be revealed to your correspondents through
      bounce messages.</p>

      <h3>Ownership Issues</h3>
      <p>All data, including emails, list content, subscriber lists
      and any list information disseminated through the Pobox.com
      or Listbox.com services, is the express property of the
      account owner and/or the author of a particular message.</p>

      <h3>List Privacy</h3>
      <p>We do not make any information about our lists public.
      There is no system-wide database of lists.  We do not
      provide listnames to people making inquiries.  All of our
      privacy policies apply to your list subscribers as well as
      yourself.</p>

      <h3>Information We Store - Pobox Basic and Pobox Plus</h3>
      <p>We do not store messages coming through our servers for forwarding accounts.
      Once we receive a message, we immediately attempt to process
      it, and send it to your forwarding address.  We will keep
      that message in the following cases:</p>

      <ol class="text_only">
        <li>There is a problem with your forwarding address.
        We will attempt to resend the message for a maximum of
        5 days.</li>
        <li>You have set your email or spam filters to discard the
        message.  We will keep the message for 30 days, in
        case you discarded something you wanted.  Discards may
        also be used to tune the spam filters.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Information We Store - Pobox Mailstore</h3>
      <p>We store messages coming through our servers for Mailstore accounts.
      Messages are stored until you delete them or your account has reached its quota, at which point new messages will not be stored.</p>

      <p>If your account is terminated, your messages will be stored for an additional 30 days, then deleted at the same time your account settings are deleted.</p>


      <h3>Information We Store - Listbox</h3>
      
      <p>All messages sent to lists are stored for the life of the list.</p>
      <p>Subscription or other administrative requests sent via email are stored for 30 days.</p>

      <h3>Children</h3>
      <p>Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to hold
      Pobox.com accounts and should not submit any personal
      information to us.</p>

      <h3>Changes to the Policy</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to update this privacy policy.  If there are
      material changes, we will either notify you via e-mail or post
      notification prominently on our web site prior to implementing the
      changes.  If you would like to receive notice via email, please go to
      <a href="https://www.pobox.com/login/personal">the Personal Information section of the User's Area</a>, and specify that you
      would like to receive announcements from us.</p>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, or there
      are any categories that you think we haven't covered, please
      let us know.  We have tried to be as comprehensive as possible,
      but we'd like to know if we've missed anything.  You can
      contact us <a href="/contact_us">through our website</a>, via 
      email to <a title="Send an email to Pobox Support" href="mailto:pobox@pobox.com">pobox@pobox.com</a>,
