PointRoll Ads are displayed across a variety of websites, applications and other digital platforms (e.g., digital signage) that are owned or operated by other third parties (“Publishers”). Advertisers and Publishers who complete our registration process are Members who can manage their accounts on this website, mobile site or apps (the “Site”).

### 2\. ADVERTISING SERVED THROUGH POINTROLL AND POINTROLL AD DELIVERY OR MARKETING SERVICES OFF OF THIS SITE

**PointRoll makes digital advertising better — for the Advertiser and for the Viewer** **.** Our technology enables Advertisers and Publishers to better market to consumers with more relevant and engaging digital advertising so that consumers who view PointRoll Ads (“Viewers”) receive advertising that is of greater interest to them. The descriptions below explain our privacy practices with regard to advertising that PointRoll creates and delivers for our customers, and which appear on many different websites, applications and other digital platforms.

**Collection within PointRoll Ads.** PointRoll may collect and store Non-Personal Information that is generated automatically as a Viewer sees and interacts with PointRoll Ads. At the request of Advertisers or Publishers, PointRoll may also assist in the collection of Non-Personal Information of Viewers by third parties conducting research.

In certain cases, at the request of an Advertiser or Publisher, a PointRoll Ad may be designed to enable the collection of Personal Information from Viewers, such as a location (town of residence or zip code), gender, or email address, from within the PointRoll Ad. If you do not consent to collection of your PI, do not supply any Personal Information in a PointRoll Ad. Any Personal Information about a Viewer that is collected by a PointRoll Ad is provided to the Advertiser or Publisher or its authorized service provider and is not used by PointRoll for any other purpose. The Advertiser or Publisher’s collection and use of data, including the Personal Information of Viewers, is defined by the Advertiser or Publisher’s privacy policy. PointRoll does not control and is not responsible for Advertisers’ or Publishers’ privacy or information practices.

In some cases, a Viewer may choose to provide information about another person through a PointRoll Ad. For example, a PointRoll Ad may provide the functionality through which a Viewer may choose to provide a friend’s email address in order to forward a PointRoll Ad to a friend. As with any Personal Information that the Viewer supplies about him or herself, any Personal Information about another person that is collected by a PointRoll Ad is provided to the Advertiser or Publisher or its authorized service provider. The Advertiser or Publisher’s collection and use of the Personal Information of friends is defined by the Advertiser or Publisher’s privacy policy. PointRoll does not control and is not responsible for Advertisers’ or Publishers’ privacy or information practices.

In some cases, information that is voluntarily supplied by users within a PointRoll Ad in connection with certain third-party services is provided to the third party. The third party’s collection and use of the information of Viewers is defined by that third party’s privacy policy. PointRoll does not control and is not responsible for the third party’s privacy or information practices.

**Non-Personal Information Collected within PointRoll Ads and from Other Sources.** PointRoll may use Non-Personal Information of Viewers collected within PointRoll Ads to better target advertisements, improve the user experience, including to better direct PointRoll Ads to specific types of visitors, and/or to measure PointRoll Ad effectiveness.

**PointRoll Cookies.** PointRoll may collect Non-Personal Information of Viewers through a variety of technologies and practices including PointRoll’s or other third party’s browser cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be automatically stored on a computer when the computer’s browser views an advertisements or a website. Similar to our practices on this Site, described above, PointRoll uses several different cookies within PointRoll Ads for a variety of purposes. We use our own cookies for purposes that include:

• measuring the effectiveness of PointRoll Ads, such as measurements relating to the impressions, reach, frequency, advertisement interactions, and conversions relating to the display of a PointRoll Ad);

• setting delivery specifications for PointRoll Ads; and

• analyzing our servers’ interactions with your browser.

For example, PointRoll may use cookies in connection with PointRoll Ads to collect Non-Personal Information, such as the approximate geographic location of the Viewer based on their IP address, the most recent Publisher websites that the Viewer’s browser has visited, or any PointRoll Ads that the Viewer has viewed or on which the Viewer has clicked. These data points are used alone or in combination to enable inferences about a Viewer (e.g., based on websites visited and ads clicked, a Viewer is likely to be a woman), their preferences (e.g., based on websites visited and ads clicked, a Viewer appears to like travel), or already expressed or implied interests in a product (e.g., to serve an ad based on a viewer’s previous interest in the advertiser’s website or ads, also known as “re-targeting so that we can better direct our advertising.

In using our cookies in connection with serving online advertisements, PointRoll may also use web beacons, consistent with industry practices, to measure the effectiveness of PointRoll Ads. PointRoll Ads may also use cookies to ensure the appropriate delivery of our Ads. For example, cookies control the order or sequencing we may present PointRoll Ads to allow PointRoll to show dynamic advertisements that evolve and change each time you see a PointRoll Ad from a particular advertiser.

PointRoll Ads are delivered via Privacy Preferences Projects (“P3P”)-compliant servers that communicate the details of PointRoll’s targeting advertising practices to P3P-enabled web browsers. Please note that we do not use “flash cookies” in connection with PointRoll Ads.

**Information from Third Parties.** In addition, PointRoll or the companies with which it does online business may use interest-based, retargeting and demographic data from third parties to help determine which PointRoll Ad is served to a particular Viewer. For example, geographic and purchase intent information passed from publishers via a cookie or other technologies to PointRoll may be used to deliver a geographically- or product-specific creative message to a consumer. For instance, a non-personally identifiable numeric code is shared via the data provider to the advertisement unit at run time via a cookie, which communicates a specific geographic area that is in turn read via the cookie by the PointRoll platform that will then select and serve the appropriate creative or message element associated with that geography.

**PointRoll Cookies Duration.** PointRoll currently sets cookies to be effective for no more than two years from the last interaction with a PointRoll domain or an Ad served by PointRoll, after which your browser should delete expired cookies. If you are concerned about historical cookies, we recommend that you clear your cookies using your web browser’s settings.
