                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong><br>
                    Personal information is broadly defined as information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization. Data collected with personal identifiers removed, so that it is impossible to determine the identity of the person to whom the information relates, is not considered personal information. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Our Relationship With You</strong><br>
                    We want to provide you with service on an ongoing basis and to establish a long-lasting relationship with you that will grow and change to meet your needs.With your permission, we collect personal information about you to: </p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><img src="Images/Bullet.gif" width="6" height="8"> identify you <br>
                    <img src="Images/Bullet.gif" width="6" height="8"> establish and maintain a relationship with you, and to provide you with better service <br>
                    <img src="Images/Bullet.gif" width="6" height="8"> protect you, and us, against error and fraud <br>
                    <img src="Images/Bullet.gif" width="6" height="8"> comply with legal requirements </p>
                  <p class="normaltext">Your personal information may also be used to create statistics about Point2's business. We will not sell your personal information to any organization, for any purpose. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Consent</strong><br>
                    The cornerstone to protecting your privacy is consent. We will only collect, use, and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law. We do not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service to you, require you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information beyond that information which is required to provide our services to you. </p>
                  <p class="normaltext">You may choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service or information that you requested or that could be offered to you.</p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Types of Consent</strong></p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Consent</strong> can be express or it may be implied in appropriate circumstances.</p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Express Consent</strong> can be given in writing, in person, electronically, by telephone, or by using a check-off box.</p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Implied Consent</strong> occurs when surrounding circumstances exist that lead a reasonable person to believe that this consent had been given, although no direct, express or explicit words of agreement are transmitted.                  </p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Withdrawing Consent</strong><br>
                    You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you withdraw consent, we will inform you of the implications of such withdrawal. To withdraw consent, simply contact us and advise us of what personal information you no longer wish us to use. </p>
                  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Security and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

                    You may access and verify your personal information and find out to whom we have disclosed it. At the time of your request, we will need specific information from you to verify your identity, before we can provide you with the personal information we hold. </p>
