**What is Personal Information?**  
Personal information is broadly defined as information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

You may choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service or information that you requested or that could be offered to you.

**Consent** can be express or it may be implied in appropriate circumstances.

**Express Consent** can be given in writing, in person, electronically, by telephone, or by using a check-off box.

**Implied Consent** occurs when surrounding circumstances exist that lead a reasonable person to believe that this consent had been given, although no direct, express or explicit words of agreement are transmitted.
