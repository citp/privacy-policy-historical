# Privacy Policy

The poison control experts who have developed poison.org and web **POISON** CONTROL®, value your trust. We want you to be aware of the safeguards we have in place to respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy tells you about the information we gather about you and how we use it.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the National Capital Poison Center (" **NCPC** ") when you use [web **POISON** CONTROL®](https://triage.webpoisoncontrol.org/#/exclusions), [www.web **POISON** CONTROL.org](https://webpoisoncontrol.org/), [www.poison.org](https://web.archive.org/), or the web **POISON** CONTROL® mobile applications (collectively, the " **Sites** " and each, a " **Site** ") and does not apply to information that NCPC receives or obtains offline. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, " **you** " or " **your** " shall refer to you as a visitor of a Site. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use, available at [www.poison.org](https://web.archive.org/) (the " **Terms of Use** ").

Before submitting information to the Sites, please review this Privacy Policy carefully. **BY USING OR ACCESSING THE SITES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SITES**. **** By continuing to use the Sites, you certify that you possess the right and power to agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to grant us your consent to use the Personal Information (as defined below) provided by or collected from you, as described herein. You also certify that you understand the foregoing permission is irrevocable and perpetual. 

It is your responsibility to submit accurate information to the Sites. If you prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. However, you will not be able to use the web **POISON** CONTROL® tool to find out what to do in the event of an actual poison exposure unless you provide your zip code and email address. We use this information to provide follow-up and optimize your care. When you submit personally identifiable and other information on the Sites, you hereby consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**Types of personal information we may gather**

First and foremost, the Sites gather Personal Information from you in order to provide customized triage and first aid recommendations for poison exposures. " **Personal Information** " is information that can personally identify you. You will also be asked to provide information specific to the poison exposure, including the substance implicated, the amount swallowed, the age and weight of the exposed person, and the time since the exposure. You will need to provide your zip code so we can get your case to the right local poison center in the event more help is needed. In addition, you will need to provide your email address for follow-up communications from us to help make sure the exposed person gets the right care. You will never be required to enter your name or mailing address, but if we refer you to an emergency room or a hospital we will give you an opportunity to choose to provide your name and the name of the hospital so your local poison center can assist the medical professionals with your care. During the beta phase of any of the Sites, we may request your phone number in order to ensure uninterrupted communication with you.

The following are additional examples of the Personal Information we may gather from you in connection with your use of the Sites:

  * We collect information that you voluntarily provide to allow you to use certain aspects of the Sites or their related services, such signing up for The Poison Post **®** newsletter or ordering poison prevention materials. Such information may include, without limitation, your name, address, email, phone number, credit card information if you choose to make a donation, and/or health and wellness information.
  * When you use the Sites, technological tools, including, without limitation, “cookies” and Google Analytics, collect certain information, as explained in the following section.



We maintain one or more databases to store your Personal Information and poison exposure information and may retain it as reasonably required to fulfill the purposes identified herein. Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice. If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, you may not be able to take advantage of certain Sites or features thereof.

**Other information we may gather**

When you visit a Site, we may automatically monitor your activity on such Site and collect various categories of general non-personal information, such as browser information, operating system information, search terms used to locate such Site, IP address, the date, time and length of stay, specific pages accessed during visits to such Site, the website that you go to when you leave such Site and any downloading you performed on such Site. This information does not identify or track you personally. We may combine such general information with Personal Information and may use and disclose the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy.

In addition, when you send an email to the NCPC or to web **POISON** CONTROL®, we may retain your email address and the contents of the email you send. This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to NCPC or to web **POISON** CONTROL®.

NCPC may use Aggregated Data for its internal purposes, including, without limitation, to improve the Sites, and for NCPC's other legitimate business purposes, including, without limitation, to supply market research to strategic partners, advertisers or other third parties, and to provide product safety monitoring data to regulatory and public health agencies and to product manufacturers or distributors.

**How we use cookies and other tracking devices**

A "cookie" is a small file or tool stored on a user’s hard drive containing information that allows us to deliver customized information to you. Cookies help us:

  * determine which features and tools you use, and which pages you visit on a Site
  * store certain user information that you previously provided ( _e.g._ , username and password)



We use both "session" and "persistent" cookies. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. With most Internet browsers, you can erase the type of cookies we use from your computer hard drive, block our cookies, or receive a warning before our cookie is stored. However, certain features of the Sites may not function properly or be available to you if your browser is configured to disable cookies.

We also use a tool called Google Analytics. Google Analytics tracks typical statistical information about you, such as sites you visit and your IP address and browser. We do not collect or store this information; Google does.

  * NCPC may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, in each case consistent with this Privacy Policy, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
  * We may disclose any information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion and without your prior permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we believe you have or are violating this Privacy Policy or any other user policy available on the Sites, or in order to protect or defend NCPC’s rights or property, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order.
  * In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of NCPC, Personal Information and/or other information collected through the Sites may be sold, assigned or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of the NCPC.
