**Privacy Notice**

Thank you for visiting Backlinko.com (hereinafter known as “Provider,” “us” or “we” or “the Site”). To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and committed to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience.

Billing and personal information is encrypted whenever transmitted or received online. Personal information is accessible only to staff, agents, or contractors of Provider.

This privacy statement applies to all Provider-owned web sites and domains. This privacy statement covers personally identifiable information which includes information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, anonymous data collection and aggregate reporting. Personally identifiable information is any information that is associated with your name or personal identity.

When you browse our web site, you do so anonymously. We may log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our web site you visit and how long you spend there. But we will not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our web site. Like many other commercial web sites, the Provider web site may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site.

**Who we share it with**

We never sell or rent your personal information. Provider may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or in good faith to (a) comply with legal processes served on the site, or (b) protect the rights and property of Provider, or (c) where our records indicate fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of, or (d) where your communication suggests possible harm to others.

Provider may transfer information about Users if Provider is acquired by or merged with another company.

Provider uses (but is not limited to using) the following sub-processors in order to carry out business activities.

Provider will not share your information with third parties without your permission, other than what is mentioned in this Privacy Notice. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. We use personal information to reply to enquiries, handle complaints, provide operational notices, keep records up to date to notify you via periodic e-mails of technical service issues, specials, or other related product/service information. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of Provider for the purpose of performing service for Provider.

Any non-EU, non-US third parties with whom we share data are nations recognized as having adequate protection by the EU Commission. In the case of US third parties, they either all have Privacy Shield compliance or are working towards this status at the time of writing.

**Internet Commerce**

The online registration at Provider is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. Provider is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption.

**Security of your Personal Information**

Provider strictly protects the security of your personal information. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except as stated herein. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.

You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your username and password, so do not share these with others.

We use SSL encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card and personal information. Credit card numbers are only used for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. Our efforts to protect credit card fraud help protect your financial data security.

**Access to your Personal Information**

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time by logging into your account.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as password and username, before granting access to your data.

Please [contact us](https://backlinko.com/contact) if you require further clarification, access or updating above that which is provided by our systems.

**Data Erasure**

We do not hold your personal information for longer than is necessary; when we no longer have any use for your data, your data is deleted.

User accounts, email addresses on our email lists, and related necessary information (First name, Last name, Email address, etc.) can be deleted upon request, under the understanding that this may affect the quality of future service received, experience of our sites, products and services, and ability for you to correctly access or otherwise receive our sites, products and services.

Deletion of personal information as above in no way absolves you of any prior agreements or commitments with our sites, products and services – For example, payment plans into which you may have entered with us.

You have the right to object to profiling or automated decision making that may impact you, but in doing so agree that this means your experience, use or service may be impacted, and that it does not in any way absolve you of any prior agreements or commitments with our sites, products and services – For example, payment plans into which you may have entered with us.
