Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

Note for “Podcasters”:

Auto Social Sharing: When you authorize Podbean to share your podcast to social media or other distribution methods, you may be asked to provide account owner credentials for those services that require access to your personal account. Anytime you are asked to provide personal account credentials for outside services, you are actually entering your login information directly to those systems. We do not collect, store or otherwise process login credentials to your personal accounts on our systems. Those sites send back an Oauth Access Token that enables us to post on your behalf. We do not retrieve any other personal or public information. You should review information about their data handling policies and terms of service.

Do Not Track

Our service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means our third party analytics providers may associate your usage on Podbean with your usage on other sites.

#### Information We Collect 

We collect information automatically as you navigate the site or through our third party analytics providers. We may store usage information such as the type of device you use to access Podbean, your operating system, browser type, IP address, and device ID, the pages you visit or request, links clicked, referring sites, user interactions and your search terms. When you use Podbean’s apps, we may collect information include your mobile device information (e.g., device model, operating system version, device date and time, unique device identifiers, mobile network information) and how you use the apps. We also derive your location from your IP address. These types of information do not generally identify or relate to you as an individual; however we may associate these types of information with you as an individual.

We process limited podcast audience information using the combination of IP Address and User Agent (a string of characters that identifies the type/version of software that you are using to access content) to track podcast statistics. We do not expose or make this information available in any way to any third-parties (including podcasters) that would identify individual listeners. We only provide podcasters with aggregated statistics through the Podbean user interface. We reserve the right to research specific IP Addresses as may be necessary to protect our podcast services, our company/employees, our customers, and/or our systems. For example, we would research an IP Address that accessed our systems in the case of a suspected bot, rogue server or bad actor that may be affecting service delivery or performance. The logs of raw data containing this information are routinely purged.
