### Podtech Privacy Policy

_Effective May 7, 2007_

PodTech.net and PodTech Network, Inc. (collectively, “PodTech”) is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. While you can use many features of PodTech anonymously, you may be required to provide personal information in some instances to access certain features.

PodTech provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.podtech.net (this "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [PodTech Terms of Use](http://www.podtech.net/home/terms-of-use).

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

### Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting information from users are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

When you post a response to content on the Site (“Comment”) or send a video by email (“Email”) we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This is information about you that when on its own, or in combination with other identifiers, can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and email address. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. Your Comments are visible to all viewers of our Site.

We also collect other non-identifying information through your use of the PodTech Player (e.g. user activity, the pages of the site that you visit, time spent on these pages and other statistics) (“Non-Identifying Information”).

We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.

These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement**. PodTech cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
