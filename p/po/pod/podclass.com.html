<p><b><u>Use of Podclass.com by Children under the age of 13</u></b></p>
<p>Podclass believes that protecting the privacy of children is important.  Although the content on Podclass.com may be used by a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen to benefit such a child, neither Podclass nor any of its services are designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13.  Although Podclass does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a person Podclass actually knows is under the age of 13, Podclass does allow a child's parent or guardian, to establish a user profile on behalf of the child.  The parent or guardian is solely responsible for providing supervision of the child's use of Podclass.com and a parent or guardian who registers a child shall assume full responsibility for ensuring that the registration information is kept secure and that the information submitted is accurate and complete. Any such parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through Podclass.com for the minor.</p>

<p><b><u>Message Boards, Chat Rooms, Blogs and Public Forums</u></b></p>
<p>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to message boards, chat rooms, blogs or any other public forum the information that you post can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.</p>  

<p><b><u>Email Choice/Opt-out</u></b></p>
<p>If you no longer desire to receive updates or notifications you may opt out of such updates and notifications by logging your account and accessing "My account" and changing your email preferences.</p>

<p><b><u>Security</u></b></p>
<p>Podclass takes precautionary measures to insure that your information is kept private. Your account is secured by a member-created password.  Podclass uses reasonable measures to protect your information that is stored within our database and Podclass restricts access to your information to only those employees of Podclass who need access to such information to perform their job functions, such as our technical staff and customer service personnel. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of your information at any time, therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p>

<p><b><u>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</u></b></p>
<p>From time to time Podclass may make changes to this Privacy Policy.  If Podclass makes changes, Podclass will post them on the site to make you aware of what the changes are so you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. You are bound by any minor changes to the policy when you use the site after those changes have been posted.
