**Do-Not-Track Signals.  **Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Currently, there is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. PODS currently does not take action in response to these signals.

**Providing Online Support.  **We may provide online customer service chat sessions to assist you while you are navigating through our Website. We will use and maintain any personal information you provide via these sessions in accordance with this privacy policy. We and our 3rd party service provider of the online customer chat feature may maintain dialogue transcripts of the online chats with us for staff training, for quality assurance purposes or for other purposes as described herein.

**Minors.  **We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors and ask that children under 18 years of age, or the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence, do not submit personal information on our Website without parental consent. Although we cannot prevent children under 18 from submitting personal information, we will destroy such information if we are made aware that proper consent was not given.

**Other Websites.  **Many PODS operating areas are owned by franchisees that operate as independent businesses. Some franchisees also operate their own websites. This policy does not cover these other sites. We encourage franchisees to adopt similar privacy policies and practices as our privacy policy. However, please review the privacy policy of the other websites to understand their policies and practices regarding your personal information and how they will treat it.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information.  **You may request access to information on record with PODS at any time which has been collected about you. We permit and encourage you to request that any inaccuracies in your personal information be corrected or that such personal information be removed from our databases.

**Security.  **PODS recognizes your personal data is your private information, so we have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. Our Website uses encryption technology to help keep your personal information safe. Whenever you provide information, we use secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology to make sure that it is "encrypted," or, scrambled, so that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet.  Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to us. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. You should always safeguard your own personal information by protecting passwords used to access websites and by safely disposing of records no longer needed.

**Users Outside of the United States**.  Some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers outside your jurisdiction of residence whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live.  As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.

**Changes.  **PODS reserves the right, in its discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this privacy policy at any time. You should check this page periodically for changes to this privacy policy. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to this privacy policy will mean that you accept those changes.
