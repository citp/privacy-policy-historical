# Online Privacy Policy for Self Storage and Portable Moving | PODS

**Introduction.** PODS (“We”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy. This privacy policy (together with our terms of use at [www.pods.com/Terms-Conditions.aspx](http://www.pods.com/Terms-Conditions.aspx) and any other documents referred to in it) describes the personal information that we collect from you, or that you provided on this website [www.pods.com](http://www.pods.com/) (our “Website”) and how that information may be used or disclosed by us.

Please read our privacy policy terms carefully before using this Website to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it. By using our Website, you agree to the terms set forth in this policy. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. Rather, the following are guidelines for protecting the information you provide to us. Please refrain from using our Website if you disagree with anything stated below.

**Personal Information.** We collect several types of personal information from and about users of our Website, including information you provide to us either through our Website or call center. Your use of this Website constitutes your consent to collect and use your personal information obtained from you. For purposes of this policy only, "personal information" refers to any information by which you can be personally identified that includes name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card information, your responses to our survey questions, and information relating to any orders you place.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** Our Website also collects technical and navigational information that is not personally identifiable to any particular user. This type of information may include computer browser type, internet protocol (IP) address, pages visited and time spent on our Website, and other communication data. This information may be used or analyzed by us to improve our web design and functionality, enhance our ability to service you, and estimate our audience size and usage patterns. For the same reasons, we may also obtain other non-personally identifiable information about your general internet usage by using cookies. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. We may share non-personally identifiable information with third parties in connection with referral relationships and for reasons stated above.

**Minors.** We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors and ask that children under 18 years of age not submit personal information on our Website without parental consent. Although we cannot prevent children under 18 from submitting personal information, we will destroy such information if we are made aware that proper consent was not given.

**Use/Disclosure.** We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, in the following ways: responding to your inquiries, providing you with information about our products and services that you request from us or other information that you find useful (regardless if a business relationship exists between us), aggregate statistics about our customer’s preferences, processing orders you have submitted, maintaining your account, to carry out obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us. To ensure that you receive any e-mails that we may send to you, confirmations may be sent to us or our service provider when you open such emails or click certain email links. These confirmations may also show whether your e-mail application supports graphics so we can tailor our messages to you.

Occasionally, we may deliver marketing and account information relevant to you, such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, reservation confirmations, surveys, account information, notification services, and for administrative reasons.

You may opt-out of receiving any of our marketing or promotional emails at any time by sending an e-mail to accountmanager@pods.com or by using the links provided in any emails received from us.

We do not sell or release your personal information to outside organizations. Third party service and product suppliers, however, may be engaged by PODS to perform a variety of functions, such as fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, credit card processing, transportation services, conducting contests or services, providing technical services for our Website, etc. We may at times share information about you that is necessary for the outside company to provide the requested service. These outside companies may only use such information about you for the limited purpose of performing their services and may not use such information for any other purpose.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, for fraud detection or prevention, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal processes (e.g., subpoenas).

**Other Websites.** Many PODS operating areas are owned by franchisees that operate as independent businesses. Some franchisees also operate their own websites. This policy does not cover these other sites. We encourage franchisees to adopt similar privacy policies and practices as our privacy policy. However, please review the privacy policy of the other websites to understand their policies and practices regarding your personal information and how they will treat it.

**Access.** You may obtain a summary of the personal information on record with PODS at any time which has been collected about you. We permit and encourage you to request that any inaccuracies in your personal information be corrected or that such personal information be removed from our marketing databases.

To make any request described above, send an e-mail to [accountmanager@pods.com](mailto:accountmanager@pods.com)

or write to:

When contacting us, please be sure to provide us with your exact e-mail address, name, address and/or telephone number(s) in order to be sure we handle your request correctly.

**Security.** PODS recognizes your personal data is your private information, so we strive to achieve high standards in how it is used and providing for its safekeeping. Our Website uses some of the most secure forms of online communication available, including industry-standard encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. Whenever you provide information, we use secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology to make sure that it is "encrypted," or, scrambled, so that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet.

To protect your personal information, PODS maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in keeping with industry standards and practices, all of which are regularly updated in response to changes in technology. We strictly limit access to information about you to those employees who need to know the information in order to perform their jobs. All employees are prohibited from accessing our files and databases without proper authorization. We periodically audit for compliance with this standard and impose penalties for any failure to comply with this policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to us. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. You should always safeguard your own personal information by protecting passwords used to access websites and by safely disposing of records no longer needed.

**Changes.** PODS reserves the right, in its discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this privacy policy at any time. You should check this page periodically for changes to this privacy policy. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to this privacy policy will mean that you accept those changes.
