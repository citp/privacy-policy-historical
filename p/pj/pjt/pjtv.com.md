# PJTV - Privacy Policy

**PJM and PJInstitute Privacy Policy**

This policy was last updated on **10-2010**

**GENERAL**

OSM Media, LLC., dba Pajamas Media, owner of  PJM.com and PJInstitute.com ("PJM") is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using www.PJM.com (the "Website"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit or become a member of the Website.

We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded websites available to you from links located on the Website. These other websites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Website to determine how that site protects your privacy.

**NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN**

PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

General:  When you register, and at other times, we will collect information from you.  This information falls into two main categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

_Personally Identifiable Information (PII)_ is any information collected through the Website that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you.  PII would include your full name, address, and credit-card number.  PII may include your email address if you have chosen not to use an anonymous email address (eg: some people have their full name in their email address, or have a personal website URL in their email address). We do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of eighteen.

Although PII is collected through our website, your billing information (full name, address and associated credit card number) are not stored on our servers.  We use the services of Paypal to process credit card payments.  Please refer to Paypal’s privacy statement which can be found [here](http://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside) for information about the storage of your name, address and credit card information.

Your email address and user password are stored on our server. We also collect other non-PII facts about your computers, profession, interests and similar information.

Surveys: We may conduct occasional online surveys. For example, when you're within the Website, you may see a pop-up window or button offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.  If you do participate, you may be asked to provide additional information.

Web Site Usage Information: We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit the Website. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and members use and navigate our Website including the number and frequency of visitors and members to each Web page, and the length of their visits.

Additionally we may collect usage information that is tied to Personally Identifiable Information for purposes of subscription tracking and enforcement, for special features, or to provide enhanced member products and services.

Help Desk Information: Should you contact our Customer Support System with a question or technical concern, we will create and then store a customer support ÒticketÓ that you will fill out.  This is your support profile.  This profile may include first name, last name, phone number, email address, and if needed to address your concern, city/state/zip and address.

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED**

We may use information in the following ways:

á  Credit card information is used only to process, validate and verify subscriptions.

á  For any purpose if we announce the purpose in advance 

á  To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.

á  To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.

á  To provide Third Party Service Providers (see description of Third Party Service Providers, below) with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.

á To allow us to personalize the content that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.

We may combine the information that we collect from you on the Website with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and Web sites.

We may also share our membership list with organizations which provide information, services or products from which we believe our members will benefit. 

We may hire other companies to perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of the Website, sending e-mail, and fulfilling purchase requests. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your Personally Identifiable Information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.

We may use third parties, called Third Party Service Providers, to provide premium features such as links to sources of additional information or to conduct surveys. These Third Party Service Providers may be supplied with or have access to your Personally Identifiable Information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. They may also collect additional Personally Identifiable Information directly on their websites. They may also collect and use non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to the Website and other websites in order to present custom information that may be of interest to you.  If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by some Third Party Service Providers, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information outside of PJM unless you "opt in" to having your Personally Identifiable Information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.

We may disclose and use Personally Identifiable Information and other information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Member Agreement or Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your Personally Identifiable Information as well as other information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

**USER CONTENT**

**_Comments:_** The Comments section of the Website provides you with an opportunity to tell us what you think about our Content, and read what other readers have to say and possibly to upload other content such as user created videos. When you use our Comments feature (for example, by posting a Comment or responding to special member participation forums), we may make public any information that you provide including your name, location and e-mail address.

**_Other User Submitted Content: _**We may provide you with the opportunity to submit other content to our Website, such as videos. If you choose to submit material to us, we may ask for information about yourself and the material you submitted. We may make public any information that you provide including your name, location and e-mail address.

**MEMBER MESSAGES**

If you subscribe to the Website, you may occasionally receive email messages about the Website that are intended to assist you in making the most out of your subscription. These member messages contain a link that you may use to opt-out of receiving further member messages. You may also decline to receive them by contacting [support@PJTV.com](mailto:support@PJTV.com).

**YOUR ABILITY TO CHOOSE**

You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the PJM Site, in which case we may not be able to provide all of our services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your profile page. Please note that media files uploaded by you cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

**COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS**

We employ cookie technology. Read our Cookie Disclosure Statement for more information on our use of cookies. We use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our site in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns. We also include Web beacons in our e-mail messages including newsletters in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.

**THIRD PARTY CONTENT ON THE WEBSITE**

When you view any third party content such as a survey or supplemental references on our Website or on other sites, our Third Party Service Provider may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The Website and our providers may also use Web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which Services pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.

**SECURITY**

The Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you is stored in limited-access servers. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your Personally Identifiable Information.

**REVIEW AND CORRECTION**

You may review and update the Personally Identifiable Information/registration information that you have provided to us by contacting Customer Service at [support@pjtv.com](mailto:support@pjtv.com) or [support@pjinstitute.com](mailto:support@pjinstitute.com). 

**DATA RETENTION**

We retain your information for as long as necessary to permit us to use it for the purposes that we have communicated to you and comply with applicable law or regulations.

**POLICY MODIFICATIONS**

When we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by posting a notice on the home page of this site that the policy has been updated and by changing the date on this page noting when the policy was last updated.

**TRANSFER TO U.S.**

PJM is hosted in the United States.  If you are a member or user accessing PJM from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of PJM (which is governed by U.S. law), this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.

**IN THE EVENT OF MERGER, SALE, OR BANKRUPTCY**

In the event that Pajamas Media or PJM is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our members and users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

**COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS**

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our Privacy Policy, you may contact us at [comments@pjtv.com](mailto:comments@pjtv.com) or [comments@PJInstitute.com](mailto:comments@PJInstitute.com). 

**Cookie-Disclosure Statement**

Cookies are a common type of technology used by most large websites.  They allow you to move quickly around the site and allow us to provide a better level of service to you. The following is information that will help you understand the use of cookies.

**What's a cookie?**

A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. A cookie created by one site's servers can be retrieved only by that site's servers. Thus, information in the PJM cookies is not accessible to other sites.

**Using PJM**

In order to access PJM successfully, your browser must be set to "accept all cookies." If you set your browser to "not accept" any cookies, you will not be able to use PJM.

We also suggest that you do not navigate the Website with your browser's "cookie alert" feature enabled. While you certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine, you most likely will find the experience of having to respond to frequent cookie alerts quite frustrating while trying to enjoy your subscription. We suggest that you turn the "cookie alert" feature off, or perhaps use the site for a short time with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use the technology.

**Why do we use cookies?**

We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter the PJM site, for example, we use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies. Next, we check our database to verify your subscription so you can gain access. A cookie is then temporarily "set" within your browser to allow you to proceed without having to confirm your identity with each subsequent page you request to view.

Without cookie technology, we would not be able to offer you convenient features such as the ability to store your User Name and Password and save personalized settings.

Other cookies that you will receive during your sessions here are from Third Party Service Providers. These Third Party Service Providers may use their own cookies in order to serve surveys or premium content on our Web site.

**So what's in it for our members?**

Here's a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of cookies for you:

  * Faster, more convenient access. We won't have to ask you to identify yourself with each new page requested. We can also deliver to you customized information and store your settings more efficiently.
  * Better information. We want to give you features and services in which you're interested. Through the use of cookies, we can determine which features are most popular with members on an aggregate basis and thus better serve your needs by developing new features and services in response to our analysis of members' usage.



**Will the cookies you send me go away?**

Some of our cookies are long term. If they weren't, we'd need to ask you for certain information with each new session, such as your User Name. Some cookies do expire after a short period of time. Remember, cookies are small files and won't pose any significant disk-space concerns on your computer.

In fact, most of PJM cookies expire after 24 hours from their time of issue. Others, such as those required to retain settings you elect (User Name, Password, Personalization preferences, etc.) will continue to reside on your hard drive for subsequent use by your browser, but are quite small and should not pose any significant disk capacity concern.

You are, of course, free to clear any and all cookies from your hard drive any time you wish; simply search your system for any files named cookie*.* (or similar) and delete these at your discretion. Additionally all major Internet browsers have a feature that allows you to erase cookies. This is usually found in the preferences section of your browser.  Your browser’s ÒHelpÓ section should allow you to find this feature.

Remember, however, that deleting these cookies means any long-term settings (such as your stored User Name) will need to be reset.

There are also a number of software and shareware programs available that are designed to periodically purge cookie files from your hard disk. We do not recommend these applications and, as such, cannot address any resulting support issues that may be related to the use of these programs.
