# PartStore.com's Privacy Policy

We realize that customers are concerned about how the information they provide on-line will be used. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will use the information we collect about you to process your order and provide a more personalized shopping experience.

When placing an order, we ask you to provide information on-line including your name, mailing address, e-mail address and credit card information. All information is stored on a highly secured server that is not accessible through the Internet.

To continuously assess the value of our on-line shopping experience, we may track the way customers use our site; however, this information is analyzed only in the aggregate and not at the individual level. To this end, the information you provide us will help us tailor our communications and product offerings so that you receive more of what you want and less of what you don't want when shopping with us. We do not sell or rent our list of customers to anyone.

We may notify you from time to time of special offers and information via e-mail that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these e-mails, you may opt-out by simply sending mail to [ help@partstore.com](mailto:help@partstore.com) with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line.

PartStore.com customers on the "do not send" list will only receive order status updates.

PartStore.com may update its privacy policy periodically and use of the information we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time of use. If a change is made, we will post the updated policy on this site and we encourage you to periodically check our policy. By using our website after change in the privacy policy is made, you consent to the updated policy.
