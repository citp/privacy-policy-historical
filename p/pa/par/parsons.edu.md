# Privacy Policy | The New School

Revision 1.0, October 19, 2012  
The New School recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. We provide this Privacy Statement to help you understand what we may do with any personal information that we obtain from you. By providing us with your personal information, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement and agree that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information as described herein. If you do not agree to this statement, please do not provide your personal information to us via this website.

## Information You Provide to Us

To communicate effectively with visitors to our website, we may ask you for personally identifiable information that can include your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or graduation date. It is your choice to provide us with this personal information; we only collect personal information that you provide. The New School will never sell or trade personally identifiable information you provide to us through this website to other colleges, universities, organizations, or businesses unless we have your consent to share the information or are sharing such information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process.

### Continuing Education Registration

If you use our website to register for Adult or Continuing Education classes (including those offered through The New School for Public Engagement, Parsons The New School for Design, Parsons Summer Programs, and the Mannes College The New School for Music Extension Program), we require that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information including your name, address, telephone number, email address, Student ID number, Social Security number, and credit card number. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you. When you submit this information via the registration form, it is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption when transmitting it to our website and encrypted using AES-256 encryption while stored on the web site.

## Information Gathered Automatically

When you visit our site, some information such as your Internet network address, Internet service provider, operating system, Web browser version, site from which you arrived, and the time and date of your visit may be collected automatically as part of normal website operation. This information is not personally identifiable, and we do not link it to any personally identifiable information you submit while using our site. This information is used solely to track Web browsing patterns to better understand how our website is being used and, when necessary, to troubleshoot problems with the site.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for record-keeping purposes. Session cookies expire and are removed from your hard drive when you close your Web browser. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for extended periods of time. We use both session and persistent cookies on this site. The use of cookies helps us facilitate your use of the site and evaluate your usage patterns so that we can improve website content and organization. We do not link the information stored in persistent cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while using our website.  
You can delete persistent cookies by following the directions provided by your Web browser. You may also set your Web browser to reject cookies from our site. If you choose to do this, you can still use our site but you may not be able to access the full functionality of some sections of it. You can obtain more information about how to manage cookies from [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

### Clear Gifs

We employ a software technology called “clear gifs” (also called “Web beacons” or “Web bugs”) to help us better manage content on our site by informing us of effective content. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website visitors. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not link the information gathered by clear gifs to any personally identifiable information you submit while using our site.  
We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt out of these emails, follow the directions at the bottom of the email message.

### Google Analytics

Some sections of our website use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how people use our websites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website includes your Internet network address. This information will be transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for our website administrators, and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your network address with any other data held by Google. To disable Google Analytics’ tracking of your usage of our site, you may disable cookies in your browser; however, please note that by doing so you may not be able to benefit from this website's full functionality. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. To learn more, visit the [Google Analytics Privacy Overview](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html) and [Google’s privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).
