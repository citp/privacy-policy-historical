# Parse.ly Privacy Policy | About Parse.ly

Welcome to Parsely, Inc. (“Parse.ly,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), the operator of the Parse.ly Analytics Service that allows customers to track usage and activity on websites and applications on a non-personal basis; to perform analytics related to the tracking; and, to store, query, aggregate, and export data related to the tracking (the “Analytics Service”). The Analytics Service powers several Parse.ly products that may go by names such as Parse.ly Dashboard, Parse.ly Data Pipeline, Parse.ly API, Parse.ly Insights, and other such names, as detailed on Parse.ly's public website. 

We have created this privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to you (“you” or “your”), our user, regarding your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Parse.ly through http://parsely.com or http://parse.ly (the “Site” as further defined below) or via the Analytics Service. 

As a general rule, there are two categories of users of the Site and Analytics Service: "Customers" who are operators or publishers of websites and applications that integrate the Parse.ly Analytics Service (“Customer Sites”), and "Visitors" who are individual visitors of a Site or Application operated by the Customer, and which makes use of the Analytics Service. 

Because we gather important information from users of the Site and Customer Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly (collectively, the “Services”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use, and dissemination practices. In order to access and use the Analytics Service, you must agree to our Terms of Service and any other applicable terms. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service. 

So we are clear on the terminology: “Personal Information” means contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information. “Anonymous Information” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. 

BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

##  Collection and Use of Information Through the Site 

Visitors and Customers: We collect Personal Information about Visitors only when it is submitted voluntarily. This may occur when you send us an email or otherwise communicate with us. If you are accessing the Site or Services on behalf of a Customer, you may provide certain information when you register, for example, your organization’s name, email address, and password. We also collect certain Personal Information from Customers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information. We refer to this information as “Billing Information”. Whether you are a Visitor or a Customer, we use your Personal Information to respond to your requests, resolve problems, improve the quality of the Site and Services, and market our products or services and those of third parties to you through the Site or other means of communication. Having said that, we use your Billing Information only for purposes of authentication and to process your payments. 

Whether you are a Visitor or acting on behalf of a Customer as part of the registration process, we may collect and store Anonymous Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser, device type, access times, the web pages you view, and other tracked user actions. When doing so, we may use Cookies (as defined below), web bugs, device information, and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, as well as your geo-location (from your IP address). “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each time you use the Services. We may also anonymize your Personal Information by removing identifying characteristics and aggregating it with the information of others so that it becomes Anonymous Information. We may use Anonymous Information without restriction. 

##  Collection and Use of Information Through the Analytics Service 

Visitors: If you are a Visitor on a Customer Site, we will not collect any Personal Information about you without your express authorization. We may, however, collect and store Anonymous Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser, device type, access times, the web pages you view, and other tracked user actions. When doing so, we may also use Cookies (as defined below), web bugs, device information, and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, as well as your geo-location (from your IP address). “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each time you use the Services. We use your Anonymous information to: provide the Services to the Customer; to improve the quality of the Site and the Services; and, to create compilations of aggregated data and/or statistics. 

Opt Out: If you prefer that we do not collect even Anonymous Information about you on Customer Sites, please click here: [OPT OUT OF PARSE.LY TRACKING](http://srv.config.parsely.com/optout). This link will set a persistent cross-site cookie that instructs the Analytics Service not to store information related to your usage. To opt out across all your devices, you may use a tracking script blocking tool, such as the Tracking Protection feature provided by the open source Mozilla Firefox web browser. Similar tools exist for mobile applications and other browsers. To block Parse.ly tracking using these tools, you may blacklist this domain: pixel.parsely.com.

Please also use this email address if you believe you have received a marketing communication from Parse.ly that you feel makes use of your information in an unexpected way.

Visit https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/parsely (or [click here](https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/parsely)) to file a complaint. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. If you are unhappy with how we deal with your complaint, or the outcome, you may invoke binding arbitration or refer your complaint to a data panel. 

Customers: In providing the Analytics Service and other services, we will be collecting information on the Customer Sites (e.g., tracking Visitors to the Customer Site on a non-personal basis), you will use our analytics engine through a secure section of the Site and you will, generally, be interacting with the Analytics Service. Any information we collect through the Customer’s use of the Analytics Service will be called the “Analytics Data”. We use the Analytics Data in accordance with the subscription agreement that we have with you. 

Usage of Third Party Cookies: We may use third party tracking services to track and analyze Anonymous Information from Visitors of our Site and Services. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track Visitor behavior. Such Cookies will not be used to associate individual Visitors of a Site to any Personal Information.
