          Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you
          with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to
          provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to
          customize our service to make your experience easier.
          <br><br><p>Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial
          information, such as, but not limited to: if you are registering using
          an email account at a free email service, or registering to sell on
          our site. We use your financial information, including credit card
          information to verify your name, address, and other information, as
          well as to bill you for your use of our services.
          <br><br></p><p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior
          on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our
          users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and
          serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that
          you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL
          you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser
          you are using, and your IP address.
          <br><br></p><p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on
          certain pages of our site. "Cookies" are small files placed
          on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We
          also offer certain features that are only available through the use of
          a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your
          password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us
          provide information which is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that
          they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a
          session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser
          permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain
          features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password
          more frequently during a session.
          <br><br></p><p>Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other
          similar devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third
          parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a user, there
          may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not
          control the use of cookies by third parties.
          <br><br></p><p>If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we
          charge, we collect some additional information, including a billing
          address, a credit card number and a credit card expiration date and
          tracking information from checks or money orders.

          We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other
          information we obtain from your current and past activities on the
          Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User
          Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify
          problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your
          information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases.
          <br><br><p>You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about
          you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site
          usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our
          site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our site and
          better tailor it to meet your needs.
          <br><br></p><p>You agree that we may use your information to contact you and
          deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your
          interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative
          notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of
          the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you
          expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to
          receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of the
          receipt of certain communications on the notification page. You may make changes to your notification preferences at any

          of your private communications and other personally identifiable
          information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in
          this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the
          foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government
          or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may
          unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
          communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that
          they collect from our Site. Therefore, although we use industry
          standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you
          should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or
          private communications will always remain private.

          identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the

          (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law
          enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole
          discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an
          investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other
          activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.
          Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your User ID, name,

          your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. We generally
          discard the email addresses some time after they have been used to
          send your email.
