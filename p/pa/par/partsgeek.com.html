    <p>
        Privacy is very important to us. Our privacy practices are held to high 
        standards by outside organizations such as TRUSTe. As part of the normal 
        operation of our services we collect and, in some cases, disclose information 
        about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you 
        and what may happen to that information. We have prepared a detailed policy 
        because we believe you should know as much as possible about Parts Geek, LLC. 
        The privacy practices of this statement apply to the partsgeek.com website.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>This Privacy Policy tells you:</h4>
    <br>
    <ul style="margin-left:27px;">
        <li>What information we collect</li>
        <li>How we use that information</li>
        <li>How we may share that information</li>
        <li>How we protect your information</li>
        <li>Your choices regarding your personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, 
        efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that 
        most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>Information You Give Us</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        We receive and may store any information you enter on our website. For example, we collect information 
        from you when you place an order, create an account, call us with a question, write a review, or use any of our services. 
        <br><br>
        The information we collect from you includes things like:
        <br><br>
        </p><ul style="margin-left:27px;">
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your mailing address</li>
            <li>Your e-mail address</li>
            <li>Your phone number</li>
            <li>Your credit card number and other payment information</li>
            <li>Demographic and lifestyle information, such as personal interests and product preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        It may also include information you give us about other people, such as the name and address of a gift recipient. 
    <p></p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>Information From Other Sources</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        We may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties that help us update, expand 
        and analyze our records and identify new customers.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>Automatic Information</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        We collect information through cookies and other automated means. Cookies are commonly used by websites to save data on your computer. 
        The information we collect from cookies may include your IP address, browser and device characteristics, referring URLs, and a record 
        of your interactions with our website. We use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience on our website. 
        <br><br>
        We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our 
        users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL 
        that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what 
        browser you are using, and your IP address. 
        <br><br>
        "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that 
        are only available through the use of a "cookie". We use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. 
        Cookies can help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are 
        automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, 
        although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password 
        more frequently during a session. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third parties. 
        For example, if you view a web page created by a vendor, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the 
        use of cookies by third parties.
        <br><br>
        In combination with other information we collect, a cookie may facilitate the tailoring of advertisements and offers to you, sometimes 
        in connection with interest-based advertising.
        <br><br>
        To help us understand and enhance our interactions with visitors to our website, we may permit web analytics providers to collect information 
        on our website using automated tools like cookies or web beacons. Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a 
        web page on the website has been viewed and, if so, how many times.  For example, any electronic image on the website, such as an ad banner, 
        can function as a web beacon. We also may share personal information with those providers.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>Public Forums</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our website offers publicly accessible social media, blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in 
        these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
        <br><br>
        Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information, such as, but not limited to: if you are registering using an 
        email account at a free email service, or registering to sell on our site. We use your financial information, including credit card information 
        to verify your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services. 
        <br><br>
        If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, including a billing address, a 
        credit card number and a credit card expiration date and tracking information from checks or money orders. 
    </p>

    <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>How We Share the Information We Collect</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        Parts Geek does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties.
        <br><br>
        We may share your information with third parties such as vendors and drop shippers to perform services on our behalf such as:
        <br><br>
        </p><ul style="margin-left:27px;">

            <li>Providing chat functions</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Sometimes we may be required to share personal information in response to a regulation, court order or subpoena. We may also share information 
        when we believe it's necessary to comply with the law. We also may share information to respond to a government request or when we believe 
        disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Parts Geek, our customers, or others; to prevent harm or loss; 
        or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity. 
        <br><br>
        Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information 
        will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be 
        forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
        transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our website. Therefore, although 
        we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable 
        information or private communications will always remain private. 
        <br><br>
        We may also share personal information in the event of a company sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event.
    <p></p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>How We Protect the Information We Collect</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. 
        Parts Geek cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
        <br><br>
        We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. The Parts Geek website uses encryption technology, 
        such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL protects information you submit via our 
        website such as ordering information including your name, address and credit card number.

    <h2>Legal Requests</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Parts Geek, LLC cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, 
        fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as 
        we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, 
        or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your User ID, 
        name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to Parts Geek, LLC participants as we in our sole 
        discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other 
        unlawful activity. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Use of Email Tools</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        You may not use the Email This to a Friend service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that 
        would violate our Conditions of Use Agreement. We do not permanently store the email messages or the email addresses. 
        <br><br>
        If you send an email using the Email ThisÂ&nbsp; to a Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that 
        email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. We generally discard the email 
        addresses some time after they have been used to send your email. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Control of Your Password</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, if any, including the payment of fees. Therefore we do not recommend 
        that you disclose your Parts Geek, LLC User ID or password, if any, to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password, 
        if any, or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID 
        and password, if any, and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, if any, you may 
        lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.  
    </p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during registration including:
        <br><br>
        </p><ul style="margin-left:27px;">

            <li>Your registration information such as: name, company, address, city, state, zip code, country, primary phone number, secondary phone number, fax number and gender.</li>
