<h2>Cookies</h2>



<p>In this section you will find information on what cookies may be set when you visit our website and how to reject or delete those cookies.</p>

<p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable.  Where services are provided on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example your computer or mobile phone.  This information consists of small files known as cookies and they cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

<p>These pieces of information are used to improve our services for you through, for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to provide the same information several times during one task.</li>
    <li>Recognising that you may already have provided a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested.</li>
    <li>Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they’re fast.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them by visiting: <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies" target="_blank">http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies</a></p>


<h3>How to control and delete cookies</h3>

<p>We will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you.  However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by our website or any other website, you can do this through your browser settings.

<h2>Third party cookies</h2>

<h3>Cookies set for embedded social web content</h3>

<p>To support our information provision and engagement, we sometimes embed photos and video content from websites such as Youtube, Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook and Flickr.  As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, Facebook or Twitter, you may be presented with cookies from these websites.  We do not control the use of these cookies.  You should check third party websites for more information on these cookies.</p>

<p>Our website may also carry embedded ‘share’ buttons to enable users of the site to easily share articles with their peers through a number of popular social networks.  These sites may set a cookie when you are also logged in to or otherwise using their service.  We have no control over these cookies and you should check for more info from their website on these cookies.</p>


<h3>Cookies for web analytics</h3>

<p>We use third party services to gather data regarding the usage of our site on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website.  We use this type of information to help improve the service we provide to UK and non UK visitors.</p>


<h3>Google analytics</h3>

<p>Google analytics is a web analytics service provider provided by Google Inc.  Google analytics sets a cookie in order to evaluate a visitor’s use of our website.</p>

<p>Google stores the information collection by the cookie on their servers in the United States.  Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf.

</p><h2>Cookies we use</h2>

<p>This is a list of the main cookies we use and what each is used for:</p>

        <td style="width: 150px;">2 years</td>
        <td>Used by Google Analytics. Each unique browser that visits a page on the site is provided with a unique ID via the __utma cookie. In this way, subsequent visits to the website via the same browser are recorded as belonging to the same (unique) visitor. Thus, if a person interacted with the website using different browsers, the Analytics reports would track this activity under two unique visitors. Similarly if the same browser were used by two different visitors, but with a separate computer account for each, the activity would be recorded under two unique visitor IDs. On the other hand, if the browser happens to be used by two different people sharing the same computer account, one unique visitor ID is recorded, even though two unique individuals accessed the site.</td>

        <td>When visitors reach the site via a search engine result, a direct link, or an ad that links to the page, Google Analytics stores the type of referral information in a cookie. The parameters in the cookie value string are parsed and sent in the GIF Request (in the utmcc variable). The expiration date for the cookie is set as 6 months into the future. This cookie gets updated with each subsequent page view to the site; thus it is used to determine visitor navigation within the site.</td>
