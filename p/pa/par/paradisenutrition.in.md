**Privacy Policy Effective Date: 01,OCTOBER 2015**

At Paradise Nutrition Inc. we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and therefore do not sell or rent our customers’ Personal Information to any third party. Further, we do not share your Personal Information with any third parties for their direct marketing purposes without first providing you the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of such sharing. You may request information about how we share information consistent with this Privacy Policy by contacting us at: info@[paradisenutrition.in](mailto:info@sannindia.net)

The www.paradisenutrition.in are owned by Paradise Nutrition Inc. We refer to Paradise Nutrition Inc. as the “ **Company** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ” or “ **our**.”

This page sets forth our policies regarding the use and disclosure of information we collect from or are able to obtain about the Sites’ users. We refer to these policies as our “ **Privacy Policy**.” In addition to the lower case words “we,” “us” and “our” defined above, you will notice that we capitalize certain words in this Privacy Policy even though the rules of grammar do not require that they be capitalized. We do this because these words have specific meanings in this Privacy Policy. These specific meanings are found where the capitalized words are placed in bold text and inside quotation marks.

We hope this Privacy Policy will answer your questions regarding how we treat information gathered from our Sites. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, other than requests for our information sharing practices as described in the first paragraph above, please feel free to contact us at info@[paradisenutrition.in](mailto:info@sannindia.net) or, if you wish to exclude your Personal Information from our direct marketing programs including e-mail, please refer to the section titled “How to Opt-Out,” below.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain through means other than the Sites, such as by phone or postal mail, but please note that Personal Information obtained through such means will be treated in accordance with the first paragraph above and our use of such Personal Information will be consistent with this Privacy Policy. By accessing and using the Sites you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Sites. Furthermore, by providing us with Personal Information on the Sites, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

As we update and diversify our products and services, this Privacy Policy may change. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check this page for updates periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here. Unless the law otherwise requires, we do not provide notice of changes to this Privacy Policy and your use of the Sites following any posted changes will indicate your acceptance of such changes.

**What Information We Collect and Inactively Gather?**

**Personal Information**

In order to process orders efficiently, when you place an order with us or register an account on the Sites we actively collect the following personal information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address and phone number, (“ **Personal Information** ”). If you prefer not to disclose your Personal Information online, you can always place your order by visiting one of the many stores where our products are sold.

We may periodically conduct surveys of visitors to our Sites for internal research purposes that may include marketing. This helps us better understand what our customers would like to see from us. If you respond to such surveys, we may ask you for some Personal Information and/or may contact you for more information, but only if you have given us permission to do so.

We may also receive information about you from other sources.

**Usage Information**

We (including through our third party service providers) may inactively collect from you information that is not in the same category as Personal Information. For example, we might track information about the date and time you access the Sites, the type of web browser you used, and the websites from which you connect to our Sites. We collect and use this and other non-Personal Information (such as demographic data) to analyze and develop our business strategy and to determine how you found out about us, your interests regarding our products and services and how to further improve our Sites. We, or a third party, may also collect information from your activities on the Sites for the purposes of providing advertisements and other content to you at the Sites that are customized to your interests and preferences. To accomplish all this, and also to allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we, as do many websites, use the technologies listed below and other similar technologies (the “ **Tracking Technologies** ”):

  * **Cookies and Clear GIFs** \- Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information (i.e. username, password, shopping cart information, etc.) while you’re at our Sites. Cookies also track where you travel on our Sites and what you look at and purchase. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.
  * **IP Address Tracking and Clickstream Data** \- In addition to cookies and clear GIFs, our servers automatically collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit our Sites. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or “ **IP Address** ”, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you view pages from our Sites, our servers may record or “log” your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server also may record the page that linked you to us and related information including any ads you may have clicked on. Such information is known as “ **Clickstream Data** ”.
  * **Email Interconnectivity** \- If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools to capture data related to when you open our message, click on any links or banners it contains and make purchases.



In some cases, we may link the non-Personal Information collected through the Tracking Technologies with certain of your Personal Information. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ACCEPTING TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER IN NO WAY GIVES US ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. YOU MAY SET YOUR WEB BROWSER SOFTWARE TO REJECT TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES, BUT, IF YOU DO SO, CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SITES MAY BE AFFECTED. Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers and fulfillment companies) may also use Tracking Technologies by or through the Sites. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT INFORMATION SUCH THIRD PARTIES TRACK OR COLLECT, AND HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES.
