("parryplay") operates a variety of web sites ("Web Site" or "Site") including www.parryplay.com and is committed to protecting the privacy of our Web Site users ("Users") and Auxerrois s.r.o.  members ("Members"). To that end, we offer this Privacy Policy to inform our Members and Users (referred to individually, or collectively, as "you") of how we collect, use and disclose your personal information. Auxerrois s.r.o.  will take reasonable steps to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. To make this notice easy to find, we provide a link to our policy at the bottom of most pages of our Web Site.</p><p>Auxerrois s.r.o.  defines personal information as information about an individual that enables someone to identify or contact a person and includes, among other things, a person's full name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as other information we maintain about a person in identifiable form in combination with one of the foregoing identifiers, such as account history, financial information, titles rented or purchased or categories of products rented or purchased. Categories of personal information that we collect include, for example:</p><ul>	<li>Basic identifying information such as e-mail address and first and last names</li>	<li>Security information such as password</li>	<li>Contact information such as address</li>	<li>Billing information such as credit card, expiration date, billing address and account history</li>	<li>Site preferences such as game categories you frequently browse</li>	<li>Ratings and reviews of games</li>	<li>Lists of games, such as for online subscription, rental or purchase</li>	<li>E-newsletter selections and preferences</li>	<li>Direct marketing contact preferences</li>	<li>Rental and purchase history</li>	<li>Sweepstakes entries</li>	<li>Complaints, questions and information submitted to customer service agents or similar individuals either in person, by phone, by e-mail or by entry on a Site</li>	<li>Site behavior such as pages visited or searches requested</li>	<li>Browser information such as browser version, connection speed, IP address and the presence of various related plug-ins and tools such as media players</li></ul><h2>When Does Auxerrois s.r.o.  Collect Personal Information?</h2><p>Auxerrois s.r.o.  collects personal information from you when you voluntarily submit that information to Auxerrois s.r.o. , for example: when you register on a Site; sign up for a subscription service; register for our e-newsletter service; participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests, or surveys; respond to an offer; purchase or rent products; or request to be on a mailing list. After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, Auxerrois s.r.o.  collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site. This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior. Consequently, collected information is tied to the User's personally identifiable information and may be used to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the User. This profile may also be used to tailor a User's visit to our Web Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.</p><h2>What Happens When I Register On The Web Site?</h2><p>In order to use certain features of this Web Site, a User must first complete a registration process. During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature. For example, a User signing up for our subscription service will be required to provide an address for proof of location and financial information in the form of a credit card and expiration date for billing purposes,licensing porposes and future charges.

We request information from the User during the ordering process. For example, a User will be required to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill Users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the User.</p><h2>Does Auxerrois s.r.o.
