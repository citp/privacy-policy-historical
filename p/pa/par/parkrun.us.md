# Your privacy on parkrun

Here at parkrun we’re committed to respecting and protecting your online privacy. This includes your need and your right to know what we do with the personal information you share with us. It also guides our policies regarding the management of this data, including how the information is collected, processed and for what purposes.

‘parkrun websites’ refer to the web pages for parkrun countries. These are administered by UKTT, who provide the technology services to parkrun organisations around the world. By accessing these websites you are consenting to the way information is collected and used, as described within the Privacy Policy below. In return, parkrun gives the commitment that we will use the personal data you provide only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy.

The collection of information: Every time you connect to parkrun websites your IP (Internet Protocol) address registers on our servers. Your IP address reveals no information other than the number assigned to you. We do not use this technology to get any personal data against your knowledge or free will (i.e. automatically recording email addresses of visitors). Nor do we use it for any purpose other than to help us monitor traffic on our website, or (in case of criminal activity or misuse of our information) to cooperate with law enforcement.

We also store the details you provide to us during registration, which are needed to operate the parkrun site/service (eg to send you your results or for our event teams to identify you when you volunteer). We use this data internally and make copies of it for back-up purposes. We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
