Protecting Your Privacy**

**Your privacy**

At PartyPoker, we respect your privacy and are committed to keeping personal information about you strictly between us. PartyPoker aims to provide you with the highest levels of privacy available from any Internet business in the world. For the security of all of our clients, we have adopted our own Privacy Code. 

**Sharing of information**

Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties. We use this information to improve our site, customer service, to target advertising and to track your interest in the content of the site. 

**Purpose Specification Principle**

PartyPoker does not collect personal data that is not relevant to providing you with the best service possible. PartyPoker strives to keep all personal information accurate, complete and up-to-date. PartyPoker will not use your personal data for any other purpose without your prior consent. We do not sell, trade, or share the personal information you have entrusted us with. If you provide personal information during an interaction with our customer service functions (for example, an email address or telephone number), we use it only for the purpose of providing you with service. We will not sell your phone number to telemarketers or anyone else. 

**Security Safeguards Principle**

PartyPoker uses reasonable security safeguards to protect members' personal data against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data. All communication between your computer and the servers including the transmission of your credit card information is protected by industry standard SSLv3/TLSv1 encryption algorithm security system. We use Thawte SSL Web Server Certificate to ensure secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site.

**Termination**

The personal data associated with accounts that have been terminated are soon after destroyed or converted into summary statistics or anonymous forms where the personal identifiers are removed.
