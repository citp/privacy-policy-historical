Types of Information We Collect

It is important for you to know that in order to ensure that our customers get the very best service and the highest quality products, HSBC Bank Nevada collects demographic information (such as your name and address) and credit information (such as information related to your accounts with us and others). This information comes either directly from you, for instance, from your application and transactions on your account; or, it may come from an outside source such as your credit bureau report. In addition, when you visit our Internet website, we may collect certain information about your Internet usage. Gathering this information helps us to identify our customers and manage our customer relationships. It also assists us in the development of products and services to meet the continuing needs of our customers.

We Respect Your Privacy

Since some of the information we gather is not publicly available, we take great care to ensure that this information is kept safe from unauthorized access. Because HSBC Bank Nevada respects your privacy and values your trust, the only employees or companies who can access your non-public personal information are those who use it to service your account or provide services to you or to us. HSBC Bank Nevada diligently maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable federal standards to guard your non-public personal information and to assist us in preventing unauthorized access to that information.

How We Share Information with Our Affiliates*

From time to time, for general business purposes such as fraud control, or when we think it may benefit you, we share certain information with other companies within our corporate family (i.e., Affiliates). These companies all provide financial services such as banking, consumer finance, insurance, mortgage, and brokerage services. Some examples include companies doing business under the names Household, Beneficial, or HSBC. We may also share certain information with non-financial service providers that become our Affiliates in the future (such as travel, auto and shopping clubs). The information we share might come from your application, such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number, and e-mail address. Also, the information we share could include your transactions with us or our Affiliates (such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to the transaction), your Internet usage, or credit card usage. Except for California and Vermont residents, the information we share with our Affiliates may also include your assets, income or credit reports, which we collect from the sources described above. With this information, our Affiliates can determine if the products they specialize in, such as mortgages, automobile loans and insurance, may be of benefit to you.

How We Share Information Outside the HSBC Bank Nevada Family

Except for California and Vermont residents, we also may share information with companies outside our corporate family (i.e., non-Affiliates) that are able to extend special offers we feel might be of value to you. These companies may be financial service providers (such as mortgage bankers or insurance product providers) or they may be non-financial companies (such as retailers or marketing companies). These offers are typically for products and services that you might not otherwise hear about. The information we may provide them comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address and phone number. For California and Vermont residents, state law restricts how we share information about you, and we have chosen not to share your information in this way.

We may also provide information to non-Affiliates that perform operational services related to your account or marketing services for us. Sharing information with these types of companies is permitted by law. Such a company might include a financial company (such as a mortgage banker or insurance service provider) with whom we have a joint marketing agreement or a non-financial company (such as a data processor or Internet service provider) with whom we have a service agreement. The information we may share also comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, phone number and account experience with us.

Finally, we provide information about you to non-Affiliates such as credit reporting agencies and companies which provide services related to your account. This information sharing is also permitted by law.
