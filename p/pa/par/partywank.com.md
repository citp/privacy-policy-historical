  7. **How do you access and correct your information?**




You may send us an email at [contact@pornado.co](mailto:contact@pornado.co) to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, change, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.

  9. **Does this privacy policy apply to third-party links?**




We provide links to third-party websites for your convenience. Once you leave our digital environment, we are no longer responsible for and cannot control what is collected on these websites. Please see the website’s relevant privacy policy for how that website handles your information.

  10. **Do we comply with Do Not Track?**




Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. But we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. For more information about DNT signals, you may visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/). 

  11. **Where do we process EU personal information?**




Any personal information collected about EU visitors through the services is processed in the United States or in other countries in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers host these services.
