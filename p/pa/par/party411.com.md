In some cases, Party411 works with third parties who serve ads to this site. These ads may contain cookies. These third parties may use anonymous information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites. We may also share anonymous information with these companies in aggregate form. In either case, the purpose of the sharing is to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, analyzing and improving the effectiveness of ads and e-mails, and improving and enhancing our site and its content. 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are placed by us on your computer through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser when you make future visits to our Web site, and to store certain information between visits.

You can stop your computer from storing cookies if you want to. Most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Because cookies allow you to make full use of the features on our Web site, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

We may also use other means of tracking your activities on our Web site or in any e-mails we send to you for marketing purposes. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. We may use these to compile tracking information reports regarding the demographics of our users, and Web site traffic patterns and purchases. We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others. As a general matter, the tracking information in these reports is not easily connected to the personal information of individual users, and is not used for such purpose. If these tracking graphics are used in our HTML-based emails, they let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. If you do not want to receive these e-mails, please see the “unsubscribe” section below. For research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web site users.
