# Privacy Policy

Parchment Inc. (“Company”) takes your privacy seriously. We have developed this Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, and disclose your information in providing our Services on this Web site (“Site”).

We use information that we collect to efficiently provide our online Services, to improve your experience in using the Site and our Services, to aid in communication between Parchment and you and to notify you of Services that we think may be of interest to you.  To be clear: We will not disclose any of your personally-identifiable information unless you explicitly ask us to do so.

## What information do we collect?

**Automatic collection of information**.  Like many Web sites on the Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you use our Site. This information may include, for example, your IP address, browser type and Internet connection speed. In addition, we may employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server that may be stored on your computer’s hard drive. For the most part, the cookies we would use would be “session cookies,” meaning they are automatically deleted at the end of a Site visit.

**Information you enter**. We also collect information you choose to provide us through the Site or via email. For example, we obtain information when you complete a registration form or feedback form, contact us requesting information, purchase our Services, respond to a survey, or contact a customer support representative.  This information may include, for example, names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, graduation years,  , demographic information, and other information not sourced from academic records (transcripts).   We may also request credit card, debit card or online check or other billing information as well as information sufficient to identify academic record(s).  You can choose not to provide us with certain personal or institutional information, but then you may not be able to successfully complete orders for Services or take full advantage of the features of our Site. When using the Services offered on the Site, Company may collect information regarding such use including any communications made or transactions entered into by you or your institution or students, as applicable.

## **How do we use your information?**

**Personally Identifying or Institution Identifying Information (“Identifying Information”)**.  Any Identifying Information that we collect is used to facilitate the provision of Services that you may order and any related transactions, personalize your account, maintain and customize the Services, develop new Company services, and allow communication between Parchment (its affiliates and service providers) and you.

**Non-Personally Identifying Information**.  We use non-personally identifying information in aggregate form to provide institutions with aggregate analytics on the overall transcript exchange activity on the Parchment platform.  This includes, for example, analytics to track where requests are coming from and going to, including benchmarking information.  These analytics rely solely on order-level request data, and do not describe individuals or include any data from the transcripts we process.

## With whom may we share your information?

Our business hinges on security and the trust you place in us. We will not release any of your Identifying Information to any third party without your consent, except as described in this Privacy Policy and in any agreement entered into by you in connection with the use of the Services made available on this Web site, except under the following circumstances:

  * **Designated Academic Institutions.** Through our Parchment Send service or other similar Service, we will transmit the transcripts and other applicable data of the student-user(s) purchasing such Services to their designated academic institution(s).  The consent of a student-user’s parent may be required for non-postsecondary students under the age of 18.
  * **Service providers.** We will share certain information with the school(s)/college(s) from which we obtain your transcript and academic information. We may also use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions on our behalf for the various Services offered through the Site, such as account billing and processing. These service providers will not be provided data from student transcripts and will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Parchment.
  * **Protection of rights.** We will release your information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with any legal process, (2) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site, (3) respond to claims that any information or content posted on our site or transmitted through the use of the Services violates the rights of any third party, or (4) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Parchment, its affiliates and employees, other Site users or others.
  * **Asset transfers.** Parchment may disclose and/or transfer information to an acquirer, assignee or other successor entity in connection with a sale, merger, or reorganization of all or substantially all of the equity, business, or assets of Parchment to which your information relates.



## Storage of information

Once an academic record request has been fulfilled, Parchment does not retain the academic records or data.  Sending institutions, however, may opt to configure the Service to store the academic records for their own convenience.

It is Parchments policy to follow the sending institution’s preferences _until the_ _transcript is delivered.   After the transcript is delivered, _Parchment follows __ the receiver’s preferences regarding the retention and analysis of the transmitted academic record.
