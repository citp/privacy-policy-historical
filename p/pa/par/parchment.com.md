# Privacy Policy | Parchment

At Parchment Inc. (“Parchment”) we take your privacy seriously. We have developed this Privacy Policy to clearly describe how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information as we provide our services and tools on or via this website, [www.parchment.com](http://www.parchment.com/), and its affiliated websites (“the Site”), collectively referred to herein as “Services.” The Services include the electronic ordering, fulfillment, and delivery of academic credentials and data, including without limitation, transcripts and related admissions documents, diplomas, test score reports, certificates and certifications (collectively, “Credentials”) and the electronic awarding of Credentials.

By accessing and using our Site or by clicking “I accept” prior to your registration on the Parchment Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information and personal data by Parchment as described in this Privacy Policy.

## What Information do we collect?

**Automatic collection of information.** Like many websites on the Internet, we automatically gather certain non-personally identifiable information and store it in log files. This information may include, for example, your IP address, browser type, and Internet connection speed. In addition, we may employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site. We use this information, which does not identify individual users through such users’ personally-identifiable information (PII) defined as data that we collect that could identify a single individual (including names, email addresses, postal addresses, and phone numbers), but does differentiate between users (as described in greater detail below) to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Parchment and our partners, affiliates, or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

## Cookies.

We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Site.

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits the Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on the Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

Cookies we use.

Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

**Type of cookie** | **Purpose  **  
---|---  
_Essential Cookies  _ | These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Parchment Site and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.  
_Functionality Cookies_ | These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use the Site. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit the Site.

The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.  We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Site, and improve the Site. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. 

We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies[ here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and about how Google protects your data[ here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).  You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available[ here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).  
  
_Advertising or Marketing Cookies_ | These cookies are used to identify Site visitors that are either known or unknown to enhance the experience they have on our Site. These cookies allow us to provide content that is personalized to match visitors’ browsing or user history. 

We use Marketo for marketing automation.

Disabling cookies.

You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility).  Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.

Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.

**Do Not Track Signals.**

Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We do not currently respond to do not track signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

## Information You Enter.

We also collect information you choose to provide us through the Site or via email. For example, we obtain information when you create an account, complete a registration form or feedback form, contact us requesting information, purchase our Services, respond to a survey, contact a customer support representative, or opt-in to provide information to one or more of our affiliates through the Site.

This information may include information about you (for example, your name, email address, postal address, phone number), information about your institution (for example, a school’s name and address), and other information (for example, your graduation year and certain demographic information, when not associated with your personally-identifiable information). We may also collect other information not sourced from Credentials, including test scores (e.g. SAT, GRE, etc.), which may be collected if you choose to use certain admissions tools available through the Site.  If requested by your school in order to correctly identify your Credentials, we may request additional personal information from you, which may include the last four digits of your social security number.

When you use the Services offered on the Site, we may collect information regarding your use of the Services, including any communications made or transactions entered into by you.

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to successfully use the Services or take full advantage of the features of our Site.

If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

We collect feedback and correspondence from you, including information you provide in your responses to surveys, when you participate in market research activities, report a problem with the Site, receive customer support, or otherwise correspond with us.

## Information We Get from Others.

We may also get information about you from other sources, for example, if you have agreed to share information with one of our partners for purposes of the electronic ordering, fulfillment, and delivery of academic credentials and data or other use related to the Services. We may add this to information we get from you in our Services.

We may combine other publicly available information, such as information related to the organization for which you work, with the personal information that you provide to us through our Services.

## Changes to Your Personal Information.

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current.  Please let us know if your personal information changes during your relationship with us by updating your account information or emailing us at privacy@parchment.com.

Anonymous Data.

We may create anonymous data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect.  We make personal information into anonymous data by excluding information that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

Sensitive Personal Data.

We do not collect and we ask that you do not send us or disclose any sensitive personal data (e.g. information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, health, biometrics, or criminal background) on or through the Services, with the exception of certain services on the Site where some users may opt in to providing ethnicity in order to participate in such service offering. If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you submit user generated content in our Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such user generated content in our Services.

## Anonymous Information.

We may use anonymous information in aggregate form to provide institutions with analytics on Credential exchange activity through the Services, including analysis to track where requests are coming from and going to, and benchmarking information. Additionally, we may use anonymous information in aggregate form to provide users with certain admissions-related analytics. These analytics rely solely on aggregated, anonymized data, and do not include any data from the Credentials we process.

We may use a third party to assist us in collecting and analyzing information as described below.

In addition, we use that anonymous data for our lawful business purposes.

## How we share your information?

Our business hinges on security and the trust you place in us. We take great care to ensure that your personally identifiable information is only shared in the following limited circumstances:

  * **Designated Institutions or Third Parties.** When a student, academic institution, or other user uses our Services, we will access certain data, including personal information, and may transmit, fulfill, or otherwise disclose Credentials and related data to such other academic institutions or third parties as authorized by such user. The consent of a student-user’s parent may be required to submit a Credential request for non-postsecondary students under the age of 18. We will share certain information with the institutions from which we obtain your Credentials in order to fulfill your order.
  * **Service providers**. We may also use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions on our behalf for the institutions that we work with or for the various Services offered through the Site, such as account billing and processing. They handle data only in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Parchment.
  * **Affiliates.** We may disclose your personal information to our wholly owned subsidiaries, and any corporate affiliates or business partners, if any, and which are under common control with Parchment, for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  * **Professional Advisors.** We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services they render to us.
  * **Academic Research.** We may share anonymous data with researchers at academic institutions for academic research purposes, including the study of topics of relevance to the admissions process, college access, and labor market outcomes. Researchers and academic institutions are only permitted to handle such data in compliance with the terms of a restricted use agreement with Parchment; additionally, such academic institutions must be accredited and the research must be approved by the researching institution’s institutional review board (IRB), passing review of the methods proposed for research to ensure that they are ethical.
  * **Protection of rights.** We may disclose your information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (i) comply with law or any lawful requests and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site or this Privacy Policy, (iii) respond to claims that any information or content posted on our site or transmitted through the use of the Services violates the rights of any third party, or (iv) protect the rights, privacy, property, or personal safety of Parchment, its affiliates and employees, other Site users or others, or (v) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity. .
  * **Business transfers.** Parchment may sell, transfer, or otherwise share your information to an acquirer, assignee or other successor entity in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the equity, business, or assets of Parchment to which your information relates, or in connection with a sale, merger, bankruptcy, reorganization, change in control, or other similar transaction. Following such business transfer, this Privacy Policy may be assumed by the acquirer, assignee, or other successor entity and/or modified or replaced, subject to the modification terms (see below), and the acquirer, assignee, or other successor entity will be responsible for compliance under such policy.



## International Data Transfer

We are headquartered in the United States and may have business partners or members in other countries, and your personal information may be transferred, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

European Union users should read the important information provided here about transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area.

## Storage of information

Once a Credential request has been fulfilled, Parchment does not retain such Credential, unless requested by the individual user, the sending institution, or the receiving institution, for the convenience of such user. For example, it is Parchment’s policy to comply with the sending institution’s preferences until the Credential is delivered. After the Credential is delivered, Parchment follows the receiver’s preferences regarding the retention and analysis of the transmitted Credential. If an individual user requests Parchment retain their Credentials on their behalf, Parchment will comply with such request and maintain the Credentials on behalf of such user in their personal account. Similarly, if an institution requests that Parchment store Credentials in the Parchment credential library, Parchment will comply with such request and maintain the Credentials on behalf of such institution in its credential library, subject to the applicable agreement between such institution and Parchment.

## Your Choices

You can review, correct, update, or delete the information you provide Parchment by signing in to your account and accessing the Profile tab. Account holders may also contact us at [privacy@parchment.com](mailto:privacy@parchment.com) to accomplish the foregoing or if you have additional requests or questions. If you request that we delete your information, please note that your information may continue to reside in our backup systems.

From time to time, Parchment may provide you information on its various Services through email, telephone solicitations, and/or postal mail. You can opt-out of receiving these types of communications or access your personal information by clicking on an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each message or by contacting us at privacy@parchment.com. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing messages.

If you have opted in to receive communication offered from third parties through Parchment, please contact each such party for information about their available opt-out procedures. We are unable to opt you out of third party marketing programs.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Services to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with the Services and may need to close your account.  We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Services by designating it as required in the Services or through other appropriate means.
