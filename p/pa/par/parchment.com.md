# Privacy Policy – Parchment

At Parchment Inc. (“Parchment”) we take your privacy seriously. We have developed this Privacy Policy to clearly describe how we collect, use, and disclose your information as we provide our services and tools on or via this website, [www.parchment.com](http://www.parchment.com/), and its affiliated websites (“the Site”), collectively referred to herein as “the Services.” The Services include the electronic ordering, fulfillment, and delivery of academic credentials and data, including without limitation, transcripts and related admissions documents, diplomas, test score reports, certificates and certifications (collectively, “Credentials”).

We use information that we collect (i) to efficiently provide our Services, (ii) to improve your experience in using the Site and our Services, (iii) to aid in communication between Parchment and you, and (iv) to notify you of Services that we think may be of interest to you.

## What Information do we collect?

**Automatic collection of information**. Like many websites on the Internet, we automatically gather certain non-personally identifiable information and store it in log files. This information may include, for example, your IP address, browser type, and Internet connection speed. In addition, we may employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

### Cookies.

Most browsers can be set to detect browser cookies and to let you reject them, but doing so may have a negative impact upon your use of the Site. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your web browser, or visit [**_allaboutcookies.org_**](http://allaboutcookies.org/).

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Parchment and our partners, affiliates, or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

### Information You Enter.

We also collect information you choose to provide us through the Site or via email. For example, we obtain information when you create an account, complete a registration form or feedback form, contact us requesting information, purchase our Services, respond to a survey, contact a customer support representative, or opt-in to provide information to one or more of our affiliates through the Site. This information may include personally-identifiable information (for example, names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers), institution-identifiable information (for example, a school name and address), and non-personally identifiable information (for example, graduation year and demographic information, when not associated with your personally-identifiable information). We may also collect other information not sourced from Credentials, including test scores (e.g. SAT, GRE, etc.), which may be collected if you choose to use certain admissions tools available through the Site.  If requested by your school in order to correctly identify your Credentials, we may request additional personally identifiable information from you, which may include the last four digits of your social security number. When you use the Services offered on the Site, we may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your use of the Services, including any communications made or transactions entered into by you.

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to successfully use the Services or take full advantage of the features of our Site.

If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

## How do we use your information?

### Personally Identifiable or Institution Identifiable Information (“Identifiable Information”).

Any Identifiable Information that we collect is used to (i) facilitate the provision of Services that you may order and any related transactions, (ii) personalize your account, (iii) maintain and customize the Services, (iv) develop new Company services for users like you, and (v) allow communication between Parchment (its affiliates and service providers) and you.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

We may use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to provide institutions with analytics on Credential exchange activity through the Services, including analysis to track where requests are coming from and going to, and benchmarking information. Additionally, we may use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to provide users with certain admissions-related analytics. These analytics rely solely on aggregated, de-identified data, and do not include any data from the Credentials we process.

We may use a third party to assist us in collecting and analyzing information as described below.

### With whom may we share your information?

Our business hinges on security and the trust you place in us. We take great care to ensure that your personally identifiable information is only shared in the following limited circumstances:

  * **Designated Institutions.** When a student, academic institution, or other user uses our Services, we will access certain data, including personally identifiable data, and transmit, fulfill, or otherwise process Credentials and related data as authorized by such user. The consent of a student-user’s parent may be required to submit a Credential request for non-postsecondary students under the age of 18. We will share certain information with the institutions from which we obtain your Credentials in order to fulfill your order.
  * **Service providers.** We may also use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions on our behalf for the institutions that we work with or for the various Services offered through the Site, such as account billing and processing. They handle data only in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Parchment. We will share certain information with third parties if/when you opt-in to receive services or marketing and other communications from those third parties.
  * **Academic Research.** We may create de-identified data from personally identifiable information we collect or receive, by removing the identifying information from the records such as name, email address, postal address. We may share such de-identified data with researchers at academic institutions for academic research purposes, including the study of topics of relevance to the admissions process, college access, and labor market outcomes. Researchers and academic institutions are only permitted to handle such data in compliance with the terms of a restricted use agreement with Parchment; additionally, such academic institutions must be accredited and the research must be IRB-approved.
  * **Protection of rights.** We will release your information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (i) comply with any legal process, such as a subpoena, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site, (iii) respond to claims that any information or content posted on our site or transmitted through the use of the Services violates the rights of any third party, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Parchment, its affiliates and employees, other Site users or others.
  * **Asset transfers.** Parchment may disclose and/or transfer information to an acquirer, assignee or other successor entity in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the equity, business, or assets of Parchment to which your information relates, or in connection with a sale, merger, bankruptcy, reorganization, change in control, or other similar transaction.



## Storage of information

Once a Credential request has been fulfilled, Parchment does not retain such Credential, unless requested by the individual user, the sending institution, or the receiving institution, for the convenience of such user. For example, it is Parchment’s policy to comply with the sending institution’s preferences _until the_ _Credential is delivered.  After the Credential is delivered, _Parchment follows the receiver’s preferences regarding the retention and analysis of the transmitted Credential. If an individual user requests Parchment retain their Credentials on their behalf, Parchment will comply with such request and maintain the Credentials on behalf of such user in their personal account.

## Control of Your Information

You can correct, update, or delete the information you provide Parchment by signing in to your account and accessing the Profile tab. From time to time, Parchment may provide you information on its various Services through email, telephone solicitations, and/or postal mail. You can opt-out of receiving these types of communications or access your personal information by contacting our Site Administrator through the [contact forms](http://www.parchment.com/contact-us). If you request that we delete your information, please note that your information may continue to reside in our backup systems.

If you have opted in to receive communication offered from third parties through Parchment, please contact each such party for information about their available opt-out procedures. We are unable to opt you out of third party marketing programs.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Security

We use industry-standard technology designed to protect your information and all transmissions made through our Site, and take reasonable measures to protect the confidentially, security and integrity of personally identifiable information collected on our Site. Here are some of the highlights:

The personal or institution identifiable information that you provide us is stored in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, all individuals who have access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information, and we limit access of such information by our employees to the minimum information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality Services.

When you enter sensitive information, such as your social security number, on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can [Contact Us](http://www.parchment.com/contact-us).

If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for activity that occurs under your account credentials. Please [Contact Us](http://www.parchment.com/contact-us) if there are any unauthorized uses of your account or other breaches of security.
