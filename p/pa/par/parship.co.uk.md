## General Privacy Policy for the use of PARSHIP.co.uk - Version 20.09.2012

  


## 1\. Security and Anonymity

  


Security is of the highest importance to PARSHIP and TÜV SÜD has confirmed that we meet high standards when it comes to security. PARSHIP undertakes all efforts to protect the data that is entrusted to it by its customers from unauthorised access. With the help of sophisticated systems of authorised access and technical protective measures like SSL-encryption and firewalls, the maximum data security is sought. The data in your PARSHIP profile visible to other users is only linked to your anonymous cipher. Establishing contact with others is done via an internal mailbox. The names and email addresses of the customers are kept secret at all times. Accordingly, the customer’s identity remains protected and the customers themselves decide if and when they disclose their identity to other members.

## 2.2 Withdrawing consent

**Subject to legal requirements, the customer may at any time withdraw its consent to the use of its data in whole or in part, as set out below. This applies also with respect to the use of anonymous or pseudonymous data.**

## 3\. Privacy Policy

  


## 3.1 Collecting, processing and using personal data

  


For the proper carrying out of the services (described in detail in the general terms and conditions), it is necessary for PARSHIP to collect, process and use the personal data provided by the customers during the registration process and in response to the personality test.

  


Personal data is information concerning the personal or factual circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person.

  


During the first, free registration, the customer will be asked to provide certain minimum information without which the application cannot be completed. This mandatory information includes:

  


• Gender

• Email address 

• Password 

  


Furthermore, during the registration process other information that forms the first part of your personality test (see below) may also be asked, such as:

  


• Postcode

• Date of birth 

  


Access to PARSHIP is via the customer’s specified email address and the password chosen by them (so-called access information).

  


When registering for the subsequent personality test, the following information will be asked:

  


• Postcode

• Date of birth

• Marital status

• Education level

• Occupation

• Income

  


The customer also answers a series of personal questions (such as information about their preferences and other features relevant to their idea of the right partner) that form the basis for creating their PARSHIP profile.

  


In this context, PARSHIP separately identifies questions whose responses will not be shown to other members. All other information contained in the PARSHIP profile is visible for other registered members to see on the website. Also visible to other members is any such data that the customer chooses to share with other members, such as age, postcode, interests etc.

  


If the customer decides to take advantage of one of PARSHIP’s paid services, the following information will be collected during the order process:

  


• First name and surname 

• Residential address 

• Bank account or credit card information 

  


Each time the PARSHIP service is accessed, the usage data is sent through the respective web browser and saved in log files, in the so-called server log files. This data includes:

  


• IP address (internet protocol address) of the computer accessing the service 

• Username on the PARSHIP platform

• Name of the requested page 

• Date and time of the request 

• the referrer-URL (source URL) from which the user has accessed the requested page 

• Volume of data transmitted 

• Status message indicating whether the request was successful 

• Session identification number

  


Every time the customer logs into the network, the following usage data will be saved in the so-called login data records:

  


• Date and time of the login 

• Username on the PARSHIP platform

• IP address (internet protocol address) 

• number of the session cookies 

• Session identification number 

  


## 3.2 Earmarking

  


PARSHIP’s main purpose for collecting personal data is to allow the customer the safe, smooth, efficient and personal use of the PARSHIP service. For example, the personal data of customers is used to:

  


• provide the results and services desired by the customer;

• adapt, measure and improve the PARSHIP services, content and advertising; 

• offer PARSHIP services based on the given circumstances;

• send targeted marketing communications and promotional offers by PASHIP or its partners (see section 3.4) based on the customer’s given circumstances;

• provide information about new or additional PARSHIP products based on the customer’s given circumstances;

• prevent, detect and investigate possible prohibited or illegal activities and enforce PARSHIP’s general terms and conditions;

• settle disputes and troubleshoot problems.

  


## 3.3 Providing personal data to third parties

  


PARSHIP does not sell or exchange personal data or information or use them in any other unauthorised way. PARSHIP also does not pass on the personal data of customers to third parties, unless the customer has given their consent to do so or there is a legal obligation requiring PARSHIP to disclose the information.

  


A third party does not include external service provides of PARSHIP that provide services for and on behalf of PARSHIP. The may include, for example, payment providers, collection agencies, and email or newsletter senders.

  


## 3.4 Use of personal data for advertising

  


PARSHIP will send tailored information about new or additional PARSHIP products to customers of free-of-charge accounts and paid accounts. Newsletters and information about products and services from commercial partners will be sent to customers only if they expressly wish to receive them. If the customer no longer wishes to receive the material, they can unsubscribe at any time – there is a clear notice and corresponding link for this at the end of every email / newsletter. Furthermore, the customer can at any time change the email subscription settings in "My Profile“ / “Data and Settings“ / “Notification options“.

  


PARSHIP also uses tailored advertising for its customers on its homepage and in its emails. For this targeted advertising PARSHIP uses parts of the customer data in order to decide whether a particular advertisement should be displayed. The choice of target groups takes place anonymously. When advertisers choose the target groups of their advertising based on demographic data, PARSHIP automatically uses the advertisements relevant to the corresponding audience. PARSHIP’s advertisers will only receive anonymous reports from which reference to an individual cannot be made.

  


## 3.5 Use of analysis programs

  


PARSHIP carries out or has others carry out analyses regarding the way its customers use its services. For this purpose anonymous or pseudonymous user profiles are created. Creating these user profiles is for the sole purpose of continuously improving the services provided by PARSHIP.

  


Google requires its users such as PARSHIP to use the following notification in their privacy statements. PARSHIP complies with this requirement by including the following text:

  


_“This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address truncated by the last octet prior to its storage using the “_anonymizeIp()” method) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above._

  


_You can opt-out from being tracked by Google Analytics with effect for the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Addon for your current web browser: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en."_

  


## 3.6 Use of Cookies

  


PARSHIP uses so-called cookies in order to design and optimise the individual experience and time spent online. A cookie is a text file that is stored on the hard disk of the computer either temporarily ("session" cookie) or for a longer pre-defined period of time ("persistent" cookie). Cookies contain, for example, information about the previous hits of the user on the relevant server and which offers have been accessed up to now. Cookies are not used to run programs or load viruses to your computer. The main purpose of cookies is to provide specially tailored offers to the customers and make using the service as convenient as possible.

  


PARSHIP uses session cookies, partner and affiliate cookies, and persistent cookies.

  


## (1) Session cookies

  


PARSHIP primarily uses "session cookies", which are temporarily stored on the customer’s hard disk and automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Session cookies are used for login authentication and load balancing (balancing the system load).

  


## (2) Partner and affiliate cookies

  


PARSHIP continues to use cookies where a customer accesses external advertising space from the PARSHIP service. These cookies are used to settle accounts with commercial partners and contain no personal data of the customer. They are automatically deleted when the customer logs on to a website or after the expiry of four weeks.

  


## (3) Persistent cookies

  


PARSHIP uses so-called "persistent" cookies to store the personal usage settings entered by a customer when using PARSHIP services for the purpose of personalising and improving the PARSHIP services. Persistent cookies are used to ensure that the customer’s personal settings can be applied each time the customer visits the website. Persistent cookies are also used to automatically distinguish which membership status the customer has, whether they have already seen particular information and advertisements or participated in a survey. In addition, the service providers that PARSHIP has engaged to analyse user behaviour use persistent cookies for the purpose of identifying repeat users. These services only store the data transferred from the cookies anonymously. References to the IP address of a customer are not kept.

  


## (4) Partner sites / Advertisers

  


Where the PARSHIP service is integrated with a website of a commercial partner, these partners can also use the PARSHIP cookies on the respective websites. PARSHIP has no control over and is not responsible for the actions of these partners. PARSHIP recommends that you read the privacy policy of the respective commercial partner.

  


## (5) Preventing Cookies

  


The customer may at any time disable cookies. This is usually done by selecting the appropriate option in the browser settings or through other programs. For more information see the browser’s help faction. If the customer decides to disable the cookies, this can reduce the scope of services available and have a negative impact on the use of the PARSHIP service.

  


## 3.7 Use of Facebook and Google “+1″ social plugins 

  


PARSHIP uses social plugins (“plugins”) provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo (white letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon) or the notice “Facebook Social Plugin”. For a full list of all social Plugins please see http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.

  


When you visit a page of PARSHIP's website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Facebook to receive information about your having accessed the respective page of our website. Thus PARSHIP has no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and informs you according to our state of knowledge:

  


The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of PARSHIP's website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmits your IP-address to Facebook.

  


For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and procession by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook’s privacy policy: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.

  


If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to connect the data concerning your visit to PARSHIP's website with your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off Facebook before entering our website. Further you can block Facebook social Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, like the “Facebook Blocker“.

  


## 3.8 Information about stored data

  


The customer may at any time request information about the data that has been stored about his or her person, its origin, the purpose for which it is stored and the recipient to whom the data will be given. This information is free and will be given in writing.

  


The request shall be in writing and signed by the customer. The request shall be addressed to PARSHIP GmbH, – Customer Service United Kingdom –, Speersort 10, 20095 Hamburg, Germany. The request must also contain the following information:

  


(1.) the email address provided to PARSHIP, username or cipher   
(2.) Service password 

  


## 3.9 Deleting and correcting data

  


The customer has the statutory right to request at any time that data stored by PARSHIP about him or her be deleted or corrected.

  


The customer may send such a request in an email containing the following information:

  


(1.) the email address provided to PARSHIP, username or cipher 

(2.) service password 

  


The email shall be sent to support@parship.co.uk. The customer may also send the request via Fax to 040 - 46 00 26 - 596 or in writing to PARSHIP GmbH, - Customer Service United Kingdom -, Speersort 10, 20095 Hamburg, Germany.

  


## 3.10 Verifying personal data

  


To prevent people from misusing the PARSHIP service (sometimes with fraudulent intent), PARSHIP, without having a legal duty to do so, uses different automated monitoring tools to analyse the random activities on the platform and check the plausibility of customer input.

  


Further, PARSHIP carries out – also without any legal obligation to do so – automated, random filtering of messages. Accordingly, customers’ written texts can be checked against word lists to make sure they comply with applicable laws and the general terms and conditions. For example, words of a pornographic or clearly offensive nature can be automatically matched to a customer’s text. As part of the so-called anti-scamming scans, customers are sought to be protected from scams.

  


Should a random / automated audit result in suspected abuse of the PARSHIP service, the legal consequences with respect to the membership are set out in paragraph 7 of the general terms and conditions. PARSHIP may also refuse to accept or deliver incoming and outgoing messages where the automated screening process suggests there is a high probability that the relevant message is unlawful and / or violates the general terms and conditions. Messages already sent will be placed in a separate "spam folder" and deleted after 90 days. The customer will not receive any notification that the message was deleted or not delivered.

  


## 4\. Current state of technology

  


The customer is aware that, based on the current state of technology, data security cannot be guaranteed during the transfer of data over the internet. In particular, emails do not provide secure communication, because "eavesdropping" cannot technically be prevented. The customer is responsible for the security of their own data transmitted by them over the internet.
