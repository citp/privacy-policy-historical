_Collection, processing and use of personal data_

The supply of your personal data is done voluntary in connectionwith the conclusion and existence of the contractual relationship with Parship. It is necessary that you indicate amongst others special categories of personal data (the gender you are looking for is a data concerning your sexual orientation ). If you do not want Parship to process your personal data and especially special categories of data, Parship will not be able to provide you with its service. Please refer to the following information for details of which data Parship collects in detail. 

**What data does Parship collect from its members to fulfill the contractual relationship?**

In order for Parship to perform the services fully described in the [General Terms and Conditions](https://uk.parship.com/termsandconditions/), it is necessary to collect, process and use personal data that the user (also referred to as a Parship-Member) indicates, inter alia, in connection with the registration process or the conclusion of a Basic-Membership or a Premium-Membership. 

**Registration process and conclusion of a Basic-Membership**

During the initial free registration (conclusion of the so-called "Basic-Membership"), the user (also called "Basic-Member") is required to provide certain minimum information without which the registration cannot be completed. These mandatory data are: 

  * Gender and searched gender (the gender you are looking for is a data regarding sexual orientation)
  * Email address 
  * Password 



Furthermore, further information, such as 

  * Post Code
  * Date of birth



can already be specified during the registration process. 

Access to Parship is made through the Email address and the password indicated by the user (so-called access data). 

Amongst others, following information are requested during the personality test that follows the registration 

  * Post Code
  * Date of birth
  * Marital status
  * Number of children
  * Education level
  * Occupation
  * Income



Furthermore, Parship needs further information from its users in order to perform its services, such as tastes, personal values, preferences, appearance, and other characteristics relevant for the personalised partner recommendations and that serve as a basis for the creation of the Parship-profile. As part of the profile, free text information and pictures of the Parship member could be included. From your answers to the Parship personality test, we automatically generate the so-called Parship personality profile. 

Parship identifies separately questions which answers should not be displayed to other users. All other data of the Parship profile are visible on the website and the app for other registered users. Also visible are data that are released by the user to other users, including age, postal code, interests, etc. 

Parship gives the possibility to indicate a mobile phone number for a so-called ID-Check or to receive SMS from Parship. The indication of a mobile phone number is not necessary to use Parship service. 

**At registration via Facebook ("Facebook Login")**

Parship offers you the opportunity to register via your Facebook account. If you use it, we will receive the data required for registration from Facebook. Due to that a data transfer is needed. 

We have no influence on the amount of data collected by Facebook via the Facebook login. If you do not want Facebook to collect information about you in connection with your use of our online service and use it for your own purposes, you should not use the Facebook login. 

For more information on the purpose and scope of the survey and the further processing and use of your data by Facebook, as well as your rights and options to protect your data, please refer to the Facebook Privacy Policy: <http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>.

  * For abuse, prevention and defense. Parship will use the geodata and personal data collected in connection with your registration, the completion of the Parship Personality Test and the Parship Profile for an automated review of any evidence of abuse of the Parship website. The data are stored in a database under a pseudonym and compared with empirical values. If the automated processing reveals a suspicion of abuse, a Parship employee reviews the rating and the underlying clues, and then the free text information and profile pictures. Also, a customer service representative reviews reported breaches of contract by other members. Furthermore, Parship uses the optional indication of a mobile phone number in order to perform a secured identity check within the framework of the so-called ID-Check. (Legal basis is the legitimate interest of Parship and the Parship members that the Parship service is not abused for contractual and / or unlawful acts of third parties).
  * For automated price determination. (Legal basis is the fulfilment of the contractual relationship.)
  * For ensuring your remuneration obligations from the contractual relationship in the event of default. (The legal basis is apart from the fulfilment of the contractual relationship also the legitimate interest Parship in the payment of the contractually agreed remuneration.)

In this case, Parship uses technically necessary and unnecessary [cookies](https://www.parship.co.uk/static_cms/parship/static/Downloads/03_gb_Tracking_mechanism.pdf) or analysis cookies (legal basis is the legitimate interest of Parship and the Parship members that the Parship service can be used safely and easily and the quality of our website and content is constantly improving.)
  * For recording and evaluating user behavior for interest-based advertising (exclusively PE Digital products). In order to measure the performance of these advertising campaigns (so-called conversion tracking), we provide tracking data to third parties (such as Google and Microsoft). You will find further details under "Web analytics". (Legal basis is the legitimate interest of Parship and other advertisers to play interest-based advertising and to provide users with advertisements tailored to their personal interests.)
  * For the integration of social plugins and social share functions. (Legal basis is the legitimate interest of Parship, to comply with the request of the users who have activated a social plugin to share their information with the appropriate social network.

_Legal basis for the processing of personal data_

  * Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, point (a) of Article 6(1) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
  * When processing personal data required to fulfill the contractual relationship of Parship (basic membership or premium membership), point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR is the legal basis. This also applies to processing data required to carry out pre-contractual actions.
  * If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interest of Parship or a third party, such as its members, and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first mentioned interest, point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR is the legal basis for processing.
  * If processing personal data required for self-promotion (Basic-Membership or Premium-Membership), point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR is the legal basis for processing.



_Transfer of data to third parties; service provider_

Your personal data will only be given to third parties by Parship if this is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract or if your consent exists. If personal data is transmitted to third parties on the basis of a legitimate interest, we explain our legitimate interest in this privacy policy. 

In addition, personal data may be transferred to third parties, as far as Parship should be obliged to do so due to legal regulations or enforceable official or court orders. 

**Service provider**

Parship reserves the right to use service providers when collecting or processing personal data. Service providers receive from Parship only the personal data they need for their specific activity. 

Parship uses service provider for sending emails and newsletters to their members. In addition, service providers provide Parship server capacity. External payment services and collection-related service providers assist Parship with the settlement of payments. Depending on which payment method you choose in the order process, Parship will forward the data collected for processing payments (eg bank details or credit card information) to the payment institution or to the payment service provider appointed by Parship. In part, the payment service providers also collect these data in own responsibility. In this respect, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. 

Service providers are usually involved as so-called processor, who may process personal data of the users of this online service only according to instructions from Parship. 

**Transfer of data to non-EEA countries**

We also forward personal data to third parties or processors who are located outside EEA countries. In such cases we ensure prior to the transfer that the recipient is subject to an adequate level of data protection (e.g. on the basis of an Adequacy Decision of the EU Commission for the country in question, by self-certification of the recipient for the EU-US Privacy Shield or by having agreed upon so-called standard data protection clauses of the European Union with the recipient) or sufficient user consent is given. 

_Duration of storage; retention periods_

We store your data for as long as this is necessary for the provision of our online offer (basic and premium membership) and the associated services or we have a legitimate interest in the further storage. In all other cases, we will erase your personal information except for such information as we may need to maintain in order to fulfill contractual or statutory (e.g. tax or commercial) retention periods (e.g. invoices). 

For basic members: You can object to the storage of personal data contained in your profile at any time with future effect. You can also erase your profile data yourself. For basic members who are inactive for 24 months, Parship automatically erases personal profile data. 

For Premium members: The personal data of Parship Premium members are always stored for the duration of the contract. If you ask us to do so, we will erase your data, as long as there is no statutory storage obligation for these data. Data that is subject to a retention period, we lock until the expiry of the retention period. If you do not ask us to erase your data until the end of Premium Membership, your premium membership will be converted into a basic membership. The previously stated information on the duration of the storage of basic member data then applies. 

Please note that your data will initially be blocked only if deletion is prevented by retention periods. 

In the context of the assertion of data subject rights Parship stores those data, which are necessary for the fulfilment or the proof during the limitation period. 

_Rights of the data subject at a glance_

You have the right of access and, under certain conditions, to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or to object to the processing of their personal data and to data portability. 

You can also object at any time with effect for the future to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes ("object to advertising "). Please take into account that for organizational reasons there may be an overlap between your assertion of your right to object and the use of your data as part of an ongoing campaign. 

You have given us your information about your sexual orientation (gender and sex). You can assert your right to object this consent at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until the assertion of your right to object remains unaffected. From the time of your withdrawal partner suggestions can no longer be made and Parship can no longer provide its service. 

Please use the information under Contact to assert your rights. Please make sure that we can clearly identify you. 

Alternatively, you can use the setting options in your profile to rectify your data provided during registration or for your object to advertising. You can also erase the data of your Parship base membership yourself. Erasure of premium membership data can only be initiated through Parship Customer Service. Please note that your data will initially only be blocked if the erasure is prevented by retention periods.

These are cookies from Google itself (Google Analytics cookies).

**Use of Google Ads remarketing function**

Parship uses the online advertising program “Google Ads” and within this framework, conversion tracking (evaluation of user actions).

This feature allows Parship to target visitors to the website with advertising by delivering personalized, interest-based ads to Parship visitors when they visit other websites on the Google Display Network or use Google's or a partner's search function.

For more information about Google Remarketing and Google's privacy policy, please visit <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en>

**Social plugins**

The integration of social plugins regularly leads to the providers of the plugins storing cookies. The various providers of plugins are summarized below under the term "plugin provider". 

In order to increase the protection of your data when visiting our online service, the plugins are integrated into the site via the so-called "Shariff solution". This ensures that when you call up a page of this online offer, no connection is established with the servers of the respective plug-in provider. 

Only when the plugins are activated by you, your Internet browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of the respective plugin provider. This gives the plugin provider the information that your Internet browser has accessed the corresponding page of our online service, even if you do not have a user account with the provider or are currently not logged in. Log files (including the IP address) are transmitted from your Internet browser directly to a server of the respective plugin provider and possibly stored there. This server may be located outside the EU or the EEA (for example, in the U.S.A.). 

The plugins represent independent extensions of the plugin providers. Therefore, we have no influence on the extent of the plugin providers collected and stored by the plugins data. 

If you do not want the plug-in providers to receive the data collected via this Internet portal and to save or re-use them, you should not use the respective plug-ins. 

Basically, you can completely prevent the plugins from being loaded with add-ons for your browser, so-called script blockers. 

Further information on the purpose and scope of the survey as well as the further processing and use of your data by plug-in providers as well as your rights and setting options for the protection of your data can be found in the privacy policy of the respective provider.
