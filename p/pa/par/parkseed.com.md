# Privacy Statement | Park Seed Co.

Park Seed asks you to provide certain personally identifiable information in order to use certain "Password Required" features and functions of the website. By providing such information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Statement.

The information you provide may include your name, address and email address, and credit card number, if you order products or services through the website. All of the information that you provide may be used by Park Seed to better serve you. Park Seed may also use this information to contact you about new specials, catalogs, products and other opportunities. Please note that your use of the parkseed.com website and services is subject to Parkseed.com's [Terms and Conditions](https://parkseed.com/terms-conditions/a/4/). 

Park Seed recognizes that gardeners may want products other than the high-quality seeds, plants, bulbs and accessories that we offer. Therefore, from time to time, Park Seed may make customer information available to other reputable companies whose products or services we think you might find interesting.

Park Seed may also from time to time contract with third party vendors to provide ads to our customers via the Internet or to send direct mail or catalogs to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. In order to do so, such vendor may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website using a “cookie”. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser or mobile device by websites, mobile apps, and advertisements that you access or use. This data is stored on your browser or mobile device and helps website and mobile apps to remember things about you to improve your experience with the website. Third-party vendors may then pool the anonymous information that they collect from this website with other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving direct mail or a catalog. If you do not wish for cookies to be placed on your computer, most web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place. However, please keep in mind that these technologies are an important part of how the website works; removing, rejecting or limiting the use of cookies or other similar technologies might affect the availability and functionality of the website. 

You can always choose not to provide information, to opt-out of receiving communications from us or to update your information at any time. Parkseed.com gives users the following options:
