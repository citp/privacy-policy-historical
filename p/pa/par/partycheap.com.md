### WHY AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION

Service providers   
We share information with service providers (including payment processors, e-commerce CMS service providers, customer data managers, direct e-mail marketing vendors, and search engine optimization providers) who perform administrative and technology functions on our behalf. In some situations, the service provider needs your personal information in order to perform the service, such as processing a credit card payment, and they do not retain, share, store or use the cardholder’s personal information for any secondary purpose beyond processing the charge. In other situations, the service provider may have technical access to your information but does not use the information in order to perform the contract service, such as hosting an application or database or providing network infrastructure support. We require our service providers who have any access to personal information to use and protect personal information in accordance with the standards of this Privacy Policy. These companies are not allowed to use this personal information for their own marketing or commercial purposes or any purpose other than to provide the services we engage them to perform. 

Data Analytics and Internet Advertising/Marketing

Google uses this data to provide statistical and marketing analysis Google also aggregates the data—in de-identified form—obtained from our Website for its own use. Google represents that it builds its statistical databases and facilitates placement of targeted and personalized ads without revealing any personal information that identifies you. We also work with internet advertising companies to show you advertisements about our products when you visit other websites. This form of advertising can be based on either specific data gathered about your interests from tracking your internet usage, or from general information based on the websites you visit.

Legal Protection and Compliance.  
We will disclose personal information in order to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of PartyCheap.com, our customers and others; enforce our contracts or policies including the Terms and Conditions of our Websites, and to investigate and prevent fraud. We will share personal information if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a law, court order, or government or regulatory request, and when required by law for other purposes. Business Changes or Transactions. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, we will disclose personal information to prospective transaction parties and their advisors in connection with a business transaction such as a financing, reorganization, merger, acquisition, or business sale or transfer. 

### HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We use commercially reasonable organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information and to meet the standards of this Privacy Policy. 

Still, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your personal information from unauthorized use or alteration, and there is always a risk inherent in the electronic communication and storage of information (including without limitation from unauthorized entry or use, telecommunication issues, hardware or software failure, and other factors). 

Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon in the URL field and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page where secure information is collected.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also take steps to protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

### HOW LONG DO WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We retain personal information for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes. When we no longer have a legitimate business interest in keeping your personal information, we securely delete or destroy it. In determining data retention periods, PartyCheap.com takes into consideration applicable laws, contractual obligations, and what we reasonably believe are your expectations and requirements. For example, if you open an account or submit a request, we will retain your contact and preference information for marketing purposes until we take note that you no longer show interests in our products or services or you direct us not to continue sending our materials to you.
