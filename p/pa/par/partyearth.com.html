<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Effective
December 1, 2007: </strong></p>
<p>At Party Earth, LLC ("Party
Earth") we feel very strongly about our customers' privacy. Any information
that you give us is held with the utmost care and will not be used other than
as described in this privacy policy. <br>
<br>
Party Earth has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to
your privacy on PartyEarth.com ("the Site"). The Party Earth name and
reputation is built on the trust of our customers, and we hope that our
commitment to online privacy will inspire the same trust in you while you are
visiting PartyEarth.com. <br>
<br>
We have adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the
basis for our customer relationships. These guidelines have been developed with
the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving. Accordingly,
guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page.
Please read this privacy policy to understand how your personal information
will be treated as you use PartyEarth.com.<br>
<br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please e-mail us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@partyearth.com">privacy@partyearth.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
We collect personal information from you on PartyEarth.com when you provide it
and in some cases, from third party sources such as credit card companies in
order to ensure that your credit card information is up-to-date. <br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>User Registration</strong><br>
Registration on PartyEarth.com is strictly voluntary. To register on
PartyEarth.com, you must provide your name, e-mail address, age, and geographic
information. This information is required in the registration process at
PartyEarth.com, but we recognize that this is your personal information and,
except as we explain below, we do not distribute this information to third
parties without your approval. Becoming a registered user on PartyEarth.com
enables you to access Party Earth content. At any time, you may review or
update the personal information we have collected from you online by logging on
with your e-mail address and password and then going to the "My Party
Earth" section of the Site.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Credit Card Policy</strong> <br>
To simplify ordering and product fulfillment in the Party Earth Store, we
request your credit card number, its expiration date and security code, and your
billing and shipping address. We transmit this information safely over the
Internet in encrypted form and store it on a secure server. This information is
used only to bill you for and ship to you the PartyEarth.com products that you
order on PartyEarth.com. <br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong> <br>
PartyEarth.com employs cookies (small pieces of text stored on your computer)
to recognize you and your access privileges. For example, we use cookies to
allow you to log on to PartyEarth.com automatically without entering your ID
and password each visit. Cookies also identify you and your preferences on our
site. You may refuse to accept our cookies, but we will not be able to
recognize you as a registered user, which will limit your access to the site. <br>
<br>
<strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
PartyEarth.com logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the
Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
With respect to the ads appearing on PartyEarth.com, information about your
visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad, is used to
serve ads to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>How We Use Your
Information</strong><br>
We use your e-mail address to send you updates and newsletters periodically
about new features, special offers and targeted promotional items available on
PartyEarth.com. You may choose to not receive certain of these communications
by so indicating during the registration process, indicating in your user
profile, or in response to one of our e-mails. Each communication will clearly
explain how to opt out of future communications. Any demographic information
that you voluntarily share with us is used to tailor PartyEarth.com to your
interests. We also may share this demographic information with other companies
with which we do business. <br>
<br>
<strong>With Whom We Share
Information</strong><br>
We share your personally identifiable information with intermediaries. These
intermediaries use your information in connection with processing payments for
online purchases and with delivery of e-mail to our registered users. We do not
permit these intermediaries to use, store or retain this information for
secondary purposes, unless they indicate otherwise in communications to you.
From time to time we may allow some of our select partners to send you special
promotional offers that we believe may be of special interest to you. You may
choose not to receive these communications from our partners by so indicating
in response to any of these communications, each of which will clearly explain
how to opt out of future communications. You may also opt out of having your
personal information shared with these third parties by sending a request to <a href="mailto:service@partyearth.com">service@partyearth.com</a> to deactivate your
PartyEarth.com user account. If you do so, however, you will not be able to
take advantage of many of our features, including the right to purchase items
from our store; and your account may even be deactivated. We do retain the
right to share and transfer all user information with a purchaser of our
company or all or substantially all of our assets if that purchaser agrees to
abide by the terms of this Policy. <br>
<br>
<strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good
faith belief that such action is necessary to conform with the law or legal
process or to protect or defend our rights or property. <br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
PartyEarth.com has security measures in place to help protect the loss, misuse
and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored
in a secure operating environment. When sending sensitive information across
the Internet - including purchasing information such as credit cards - we use
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption via Authorize.net. Internally, all
customer information is protected with multiple security checks. Employee
access to the system is limited to the functionality necessary for each
person's job. Relevant employees are informed of our security policies and
their access to applications and data on our network.<br>
<br>
If you still do not feel comfortable about leaving your credit card information
on our secured Web site, please contact our customer service department at <a href="mailto:service@partyearth.com">service@partyearth.com</a> and we'll be
happy to help you with your order.<br>
<br>
<strong>Links</strong><br>
We may provide links to third party Web sites as a service to our users. Please
be aware that we cannot control and are not responsible for the information
collection practices of such Web sites, which may differ from those of
PartyEarth.com. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies
on these Web sites before providing any information to them. <br>
<br>
<strong>How You Can Access or
Correct Your Information</strong><br>
If you are a registered PartyEarth.com user you can make changes to your
personal information at any time by clicking on "My Party Earth" and
editing your user profile, or by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:service@partyearth.com">service@partyearth.com</a>. At any time
you can also review your personal information in the "My Party Earth" section

<br>

questions about our privacy policy, you may e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@partyearth.com">privacy@partyearth.com</a>, or write to us

    your membership</li>
    <li>Correct
    personal information that you state is erroneous&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Permit
    you to "opt out" of further e-mail contact (excepting

    </li>
</ol>
<p>To request a correction or cancellation, send us a message through
the Contact Us form on the Site, or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:service@partyearth.com">service@partyearth.com</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
If we decide to materially change our privacy policy, we will post changes on
this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we
use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Regardless of later
updates, we will never use the information you submit under this current policy
in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise
prevent that use (we will post a notification of such changes 30 days prior to
their implementation). You may determine when this privacy policy was updated
last by noting the "Last Updated" date directly beneath the title of
this page.</p>
