  The properties, subsidiaries, affiliates, and service providers with whom we may share your personal data (“Recipients of the Data”) may be located outside of Macau, when one the following applies:

  * The Macau Office for Personal Protection Office has considered the jurisdiction to where the data is to be transferred offers an adequate level of protection when compared with Macau Personal Data Protection laws and authorizes the transfer;
  * You have given us your consent;
  * It is necessary for the performance of a contract between the you and the Company or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to a request of yours; 
  * It is necessary for the performance or conclusion of a contract concluded or to be concluded in your interests between the Company and a Recipient;

We only share data with service providers that have entered into a written agreement with us that is substantially similar to our privacy policy. Prior to entering into a contract or disclosing personal data, we would have a reasonable basis for believing that the Recipient (a) is capable of maintaining reasonable safeguards for the personal data, and (b) maintains sufficient procedures to detect and respond to security breaches that could compromise personal information.

If you are located outside Macau and you interact with our website or provide your personal data, then your personal data may be transferred to Macao.

By having access to our websites and using our services and products you are authorizing us to transfer your personal data to Affiliates, Agents and Service Providers, which may be located outside of Macau and/or Hong Kong, and that may have a different level of protection. The transfers hereby authorized may constitute an international transfer of Your Personal Data to other jurisdictions and the different jurisdictions where the recipients are incorporated, including, without limitation, the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China, may have different data privacy laws and protections.

We strive to take appropriate security measures to help safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure.  For example, only authorized employees are allowed to access personal data, and they may only access it for permitted business functions.  We also use technology to protect your information, including encrypting sensitive personal data that is transferred to or from our systems and using firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from accessing information.  If you have an online account with us, your account is also protected by a password for your privacy and security, and you must prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal data by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, limiting access to your devices, and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.  

While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of information will never occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent it.  Please keep in mind that no method of storage or transmission over the Internet is completely secure, so your use of our products and services and provision of information to us is at your own risk.

Please be aware that our websites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those websites linked to our websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of websites to which our website links. If you provide any information to such third parties, different rules regarding the collection and use of your personal data may apply. We strongly suggest you review such third party's privacy policies before providing any data to them.
