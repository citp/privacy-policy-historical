Certain Royal Mail products or services have terms and conditions detailed in documents called ‘Schemes’. These Schemes are published under the Postal Services Act 2000 and mean that it is not necessary for Royal Mail to have individual contracts with each and every customer purchasing these products or using these services.

| 

Legitimate Interests – we need to process your data to provide these postal services for which you have paid.

| 

Legitimate Interests and consent – we need to process your data to provide the sender and recipient with your details in order to complete the delivery and to allow the delivery to be properly tracked within the postal service.  In some circumstances, we will obtain your consent to do this, otherwise we have a legitimate interest to do so.

**4\. Information about marketing**

**Marketing**

Royal Mail Group would like to keep in touch with you about our products, services and offers that might interest you. You have a choice whether you wish to receive these communications and may object at any time.

Royal Mail Group won’t send individuals these communications if you opt out or otherwise ask us to stop direct marketing. Where we collect contact information from you, which may be used for marketing purposes, we will provide you with an opportunity to object to marketing.

Organisations can process personal data for direct marketing purposes where it is necessary for their legitimate interests. Royal Mail Group has a legitimate interest in promoting its products and services but will always comply with privacy regulations and individuals’ right to object to marketing.

We may use your personal data to enable us to provide you with targeted marketing content through social media and online.

**To personalise your experience**

We want to ensure that marketing communications relating to our products and services, including online advertising, are relevant to your interests. To do this, we may use your personal data to understand your interests better, so that we can try to predict what other products, services and information you might be most interested in. This enables us to tailor our communications to make them more relevant and interesting for you. Looking at your browsing behaviour and purchases helps us to understand you as a customer better and it allows us to provide you with personalised services and communications. We may also measure your responses to marketing communications relating to products and services we offer, which enables us to offer you products and services that better meet your needs as a customer.

**Changing your marketing preferences:**

You can change your marketing preferences online, over the phone, using the ‘unsubscribe’ link in our marketing emails, replying STOP to the short code in our marketing text messages or by writing to us at any time. The choice is entirely yours, but if you say you do not want to receive marketing information from us this will prevent you from receiving offers or hearing about other products which may be of interest to you.

You may still receive service-related communications from us. For example, you may still receive a message to confirm your order and provide important information about your use of our products or services.

If you have registered through our royalmail.com or parcelforce.com websites, you can change your marketing preferences online at any time:

  * Marketing preferences provided through royalmail.com 
    * You can change your preferences for receiving marketing communications through the ‘My Account’ section of the Royal Mail website: <https://www.royalmail.com/user/login>
  * Marketing preferences provided through parcelforce.com 
    * Account customers can change their preferences for receiving marketing communications through the 'My Profile’ section of the Parcelforce website, [login here](https://www.parcelforce.com/user/login)



You can also contact our Information Rights team to ask us to stop sending marketing emails, letters or other forms of direct marketing – [information.rights@royalmail.com](mailto:information.rights@royalmail.com)

**Market research**

We like to hear your views as this can help us to improve our products and services. So from time to time we may contact you for market research purposes. You always have the choice about whether to take part in our market research.

**Internal Royal Mail Group**

Relevant employees or agents within Royal Mail Group may access your data for the purposes set out above. For example, if you contact us with an enquiry or complaint, your information will be seen by relevant employees within our Customer Services teams. Categories of recipients outside of Royal Mail Group are listed below:

**Customers**

We share personal data with Royal Mail Group customers for the purposes of providing services to them. For example, this includes the provision of proof of delivery and status of delivery information for items we have delivered or data shared in accordance with the terms and conditions of specific services.

**Selected third parties**

Information will be shared with specific categories of third parties where customers have indicated they wish to receive information about products, services or promotions provided by those third parties that may be of interest to them.

Royal Mail Group may share personal data with other organisations or public bodies for legal purposes, such the police, law enforcement agencies, fraud prevention agencies and other bodies where is necessary or appropriate for the prevention or detection of crime or to protect the rights, property or safety of any person.

**Postal authorities**

Royal Mail Group will share personal data with overseas postal authorities. If you send a letter or parcel overseas, Royal Mail Group will provide the data required for customs and tax clearance or for security screening. This information will normally include: shipper name and address, receiver name and address.

Royal Mail Group will also share personal data relating to the addressee/recipient of an item which is sent overseas. Where an item is sent overseas, we will provide overseas postal authorities with information required for transport, customer clearance and delivery.

**Disclosures required by law or for regulatory purposes**

Personal data may be shared with regulators, such as the Information Commissioner, where necessary or appropriate for regulatory purposes such as compliance with legal obligations.

**6\. Security and fraud prevention**

If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Information may be shared through the Cifas National Fraud Database (<https://www.cifas.org.uk/services/national-fraud-database>). Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. Royal Mail Group and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:

  * Managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities
  * Recovering debt
  * Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance
  * Checking details of job applicants and employees



We and other organisations will also access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.

**7\. Transfers of personal data outside of the UK**

We may send transfer personal data outside of the UK where a Royal Mail Group company or other body outside of the UK needs to process information for the purposes stated in this privacy notice.

We may send information outside of the UK where we use a service provider or technology provider based overseas. Where we send personal data outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") we will ensure that suitable safeguards are in place to protect the information. For example, these safeguards might include:

  * We’ll use the model contractual clauses provided by the European Commission
  * The European Commission will decide that the country or international organisation has an adequate level of personal data protection
  * The information will be handled by an organisation that is providing a level of protection that’s approved by the European Commission. For example, the Privacy Shield scheme for organisations based in the USA



**International Postal Services**

Where letters or parcels are sent overseas, personal data may need to be shared between postal authorities in different countries.  Personal data that Royal Mail Group collects from you may be transferred to, or stored or processed at a destination within or outside the EEA by ourselves or one of our suppliers in accordance with applicable laws on data protection. Such processing may include, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

**8\. How long do we keep personal data?**

Royal Mail Group policy is to only retain information for as long as it is required for the purpose or purposes for which we use it. We will determine how long to retain different data based on the following requirements:

  * How long the information is needed for the purpose or purposes it is used for.
  * Legal and regulatory requirements – such as where Royal Mail Group needs to retain customer records and records of purchases for an additional period of time in order to comply with the law or in case of potential claims.



**9\. Your legal rights**

If you wish to exercise your individual rights in respect of your personal data please contact our Information Rights Team: [information.rights@royalmail.com](mailto:information.rights@royalmail.com). You have the following rights:

The right to be informed

Royal Mail Group will provide you with ‘fair processing information’ where we collect personal data from you (e.g. when you open an account or apply for a service online) and also through privacy notices such as this one.

Right of access

You have the right to access your personal data and details of how we process it.

You can request details of the personal data Royal Mail Group holds about you, by contacting our Information Rights Team – [information.rights@royalmail.com](mailto:information.rights@royalmail.com).

Proof of identification is required in order to protect your information. We also request that applicants state which information and processing activities their request relates to (e.g. which Royal Mail Group services does the request relate to) as well as likely dates of the processing. An optional application form may be provided to assist us in confirming your identity and locating the information you require.

Right to rectification

You have the right to have personal data about you rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

Royal Mail Group will ensure that personal data is kept accurate and up to date as far as is reasonably possible. However, Royal Mail Group relies on customers to ensure that some of the information it holds about them is accurate and up-to-date. We encourage customers to inform Royal Mail Group of any changes to their information (e.g. by updating your account details on Royal Mail Group websites).

Right to object

You have the right to object to some uses of personal data, such as direct marketing as set out in section 4 above. Individuals also have the right to object to the processing of personal data based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest.

Right to erasure

You have the right to request that we delete or remove of personal data from our records where there is no legitimate reason for us to continue processing it. Where personal data is still needed for legitimate purposes, it will not be possible to delete that data and some requests may therefore be declined.

Right to restrict processing

You have the right to ‘block’ the processing of personal data in limited circumstances. This right may apply:

  * If the accuracy of your personal data needs to be verified,
  * If the legal basis for processing your personal data is disputed and needs to be considered by Royal Mail Group,
  * If processing was unlawful but you do not want personal data to be deleted, or;
  * If personal data is no longer required Royal Mail Group but you want the data to be retained for the purposes of a legal claim.



Right to data portability

This right only applies to personal data which you have provided to us, which we use on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you.

The right to data portability enables individuals to reuse their personal data across different services; allowing them to move or copy data from one organisation to another if they choose.

Your right to withdraw consent

Where we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent.
