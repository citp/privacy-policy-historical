Privacy Policy

Version 1.1 -- January 8, 2003 

The privacy and security of our program participants and their family/guardians is very important to us. This privacy policy describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from website visitors. This website is operated by Count Me In Corporation for ParentMap ("ParentMap"). Please note when you enter any other ParentMap website, it may have a different privacy policy specific to that site. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of each ParentMap site. 

1\. What Information We Collect and How We Use It

**Participant Information**   
To participate in any of the programs offered on the site you will need to register. If the participant is a child, a parent or guardian will need to register them. To register you will need to provide personal information such as name, address, contact information and specific criteria (e.g., age or gender) that is established for each program. You will also be asked to provide payment information such as credit card numbers. You will need to select a unique user name and password to verify your identity for future access. This allows you to access and edit personal information that you have provided. Contact information is used for notification purposes (e.g., to confirm program registration) or when necessary for customer service. Payment information is used only to bill you for programs, products and services that you specifically request. 

**Our Use of Cookies**   
A "cookie" is a small piece of information that many websites use to simplify your online experience. We write this information on your hard drive, and we retrieve it when you visit our site. No one else can read a cookie that we write, and we cannot read cookies from other websites. Our cookies do not contain any personal information they simply identify the computer you are using. When you visit our site, the cookie helps us understand how you navigate from page to page on our site. Cookies help us design our site in a way that is easy to use and comfortable to our members. Your browser allows you to control whether and when websites write cookies to your computer. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent that. If you do not allow us to use cookies, not all features of our website will work as designed. 

**Additional Uses**   
All of the information we collect, both what you tell us and what we collect through the use of cookies, is used to personalize your account, to customize our services and to allow our customer service representatives to contact you when necessary. We release personally identifying information you have provided to process a request for a program, product or service or when we provide you with prior notice. We will also disclose personal information about an individual user if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an applicable law or valid legal process. We will use contact information that you provide to send you information about us and promotional material from some of our partners. You can opt out of receiving these promotions. Information may be released on an aggregated basis (meaning that the information from many participants is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular participant). 

In addition to the disclosures described above, personal information about our users may be provided occasionally to outside auditors, consultants, and others we hire for routine website operations, to help us manage email communications with our members, or for other standard business activities. We ask all recipients to agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information. 

2\. Linked Websites

Our web site contains links to partners, advertisers and third party Internet sites and services that may collect data in connection with registrations, promotions, e-commerce, etc. These sites have their own policies regarding privacy and content that are not under our control. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of these sites. Please understand that we have no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. If you click on a website link, we do not send any personal information to that website unless we have advised you about the disclosure. Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns about any links that you find on our site. 

3\. Security

We use a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. All information we collect is stored in encrypted form in a secure database which is protected by a firewall and hosted in a high security operating environment that is monitored 7 x 24 and not accessible by the public. We use secure socket layers (SSL) encryption for all credit card transactions that we process and whenever we transfer registration data. 

4\. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

This policy statement has a version number and date. If we change the policy, we will also change the version number and date so users can tell that a change has been made. We may make minor changes from time to time as our services change, as our relationship with other partners develops, and as the Internet evolves. If we plan to make a significant change in the way in which we collect, use, or disclose personal information, we will notify registrants of the change. 

Please contact us at (206) 709-9026 if you have questions or need additional information not provided here.
