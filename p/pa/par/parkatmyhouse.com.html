<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>


 <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>ParkatmyHouse Limited, trading as ParkatmyHouse ("we" or "us") take the privacy of your information very seriously. This policy explains how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you via this site (referred to below as "the Site"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. By
    using the Site and any services we offer via the Site, you are agreeing to be bound
    by this policy in respect of the information collected about you via this Site.</li>

    <li>If you have any queries about the policy, please <a href="http://help.parkatmyhouse.com/" rel="new-window" class="help-dropbox">get in touch</a> and we will do our best to answer your
    questions.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Personal information collected</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>We will collect the following personal information from you:

      <ol>
        <li>Certain information required to register with the Site including first and
        last name, your address and date of birth together with some basic security
        information;</li>

        <li>Details of any bookings you make through the Site;</li>

        <li>Your e-mail address and password;</li>

        <li>Billing information such as your credit card number and expiry date;</li>

        <li>Other information about you that you voluntarily supply to use by filling out
        your profile page.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Although it is not compulsory to give us this information, if you do not then you
    cannot register as a member of the Site or make a booking for a parking space with our
    parking space owners.</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>Use of this information</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>We will use this information in order to:
      <ul>
        <li>administer your booking (on behalf of the Parking space owner);</li>
        <li>collect payment of parking space fees from you on behalf of our Parking space owners;</li>
        <li>make general improvements to our Site and the services we offer;</li>
        <li>analyse how customers are making use of the Site;</li>
        <li>notify you of certain offers and new products (subject to your right to
        unsubscribe or opt-out).</li>
        <li>market and advertise relevant prodcuts and services. This may include ParkatmyHouse and our partners sending you information about products and services that will be relevant to you, by email, mobile messaging, postal mail or direct telephone contact. All of the above are subject to your stated preferences; we and our content partners will always make it clear how you can prevent i.e. opt-out of these uses.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>


  <h2>Sharing this information</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Credit or debit card payments will be collected by our payment processor.</li>

    <li>In order for payments to be processed you may need to provide some necessary
    details to our agent. We tell you about this at the point we collect that information
    on the Site.</li>

    <li>We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of
    some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business
    restructuring or reorganisation, but we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that
    your privacy rights continue to be protected.</li>
    
    <li>We may use third party suppliers to provide part of our service to you. In some circumstances these providers may be based in countries outside the European Economic Area whose laws provide for a different standard of protection for your personal information than that provided under UK Law. In such circumstances we will have in place strict contractual arrangements that will require your information is processed securely, at least to a standard equivalent to the UK Data Protection Act 1998. </li>

    <li>Other than as set out above, we will not disclose any of your personal
    information without your permission unless we are required by law to do so (for
    example, if required to do so by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of
    fraud or other crime).</li>

    <li>Information automatically collected from your computer

      <ol>
        <li><b>Log files/IP addresses</b>. When you visit the Site our web server
        automatically records your IP address. This IP address is not linked to any of your
        personal information. We may also gather other non-personal information (from which
        we cannot identify you) such as the type of your internet browser which we use to
        provide you with a more effective service.</li>

        <li>
          <b>Cookies</b>. When you visit the Site we may store some information (commonly
          known as a "cookie") on your computer. Cookies are
          pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and
          sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that
          created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means that they cannot
          be used to track your movements around the web. Passwords and credit card numbers
          are not stored in cookies. A cookie helps you get the best out of the Site and
          helps us to provide you with a more customised service. We use cookies for the
          following purposes:

          <ol>
            <li>Storing details about your site preferences (for instance which language you
            wish to view pages in);</li>

            <li>Storing details about any properties you have short-listed;</li>

            <li>Enabling our web server to track your session between pages of the site and
            provide a continuity of experience.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>You can block or erase cookies from your computer if you want to (your
        browser's help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain
        parts of the Site are reliant on the use of cookies to operate correctly and may not
        work correctly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>

  <h2>Other Sites</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites
    even if you access them using links from our Site and recommend that you check the
    policy of each site you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any
    concerns or questions.</li>

    <li>In addition, if you linked to this Site from a third party site, we cannot be
    responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that
    third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and
    contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.</li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Transferring your information outside of Europe</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>As part of the services offered to you through the Site, the information you
    provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Union
    (EU). By way of example, this may happen if any of
    our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EU or one of
    our service providers is located in a country outside of the EU. We may also share
    information between group companies, which may be located in countries worldwide.
    These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. If we transfer
    your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps with the aim of
    ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this
    privacy policy.</li>

    <li>If you use the Site while you are outside the EU, your information may be
    transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Further questions</h2>

  <p>If at any time you would like to contact us with your views about our privacy
  practices, or with any enquiry relating to your personal information, you can do so by
