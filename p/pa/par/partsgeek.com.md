We collect information through cookies and other automated means. Cookies are commonly used by websites to save data on your computer. The information we collect from cookies may include your IP address, browser and device characteristics, referring URLs, and a record of your interactions with our website. We use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience on our website. 

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 

"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. 

Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a vendor, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. 

In combination with other information we collect, a cookie may facilitate the tailoring of advertisements and offers to you, sometimes in connection with interest-based advertising. 

To help us understand and enhance our interactions with visitors to our website, we may permit web analytics providers to collect information on our website using automated tools like cookies or web beacons. Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the website has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the website, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon. We also may share personal information with those providers. 

#### Public Forums
