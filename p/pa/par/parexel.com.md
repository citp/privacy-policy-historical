# Privacy Policy | Parexel

## Web Sites Privacy Commitment

### This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 2018

Parexel will collect information through its websites that can identify you (if provided by you), such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, company name and position. Parexel may use this information to respond to your requests for information, products or services. Parexel may also collect information that will usually not allow us to directly identify you, such as information gathered through "cookies" (see below).

When you contact Parexel via its websites to request or to access information, you are asked to provide your personal information. By providing your personal information to Parexel via its websites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to receive communications from Parexel.

The information you provide to us will be available to Parexel, its subsidiaries and third parties working with or on behalf of Parexel. Access to your information and the equipment processing it, is at all times restricted to appropriate staff. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Parexel will not trade, sell, release, share or transfer your personal information for use by any business outside the Parexel organization without your consent, or in a form other than what was disclosed to you at the time the information was collected, unless permitted or required by law.

Parexel reserves the right to disclose all information collected to the extent required by law or to respond to judicial process. Parexel may also provide any or all collected information to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of the particular website to which the information relates if such third party agrees to treat all such information substantially in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Parexel takes reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information regardless of the country where such information is stored or transferred to.

In jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws, and where contractual commitments require, Parexel ensures that individuals can exercise all relevant informational rights with respect to their personal information collected by Parexel via its websites, including, but not limited to, the right of access and correction, to withdraw consent at any time, object to data processing, request data deletion, restrict aspects of data processing, and request transmission of provided personal information in a common digital format (e.g., pdf) to themselves or another organization.

Please keep in mind that Clinical trial / study subjects must contact their investigator at their study site, who will be able to make the necessary link to subject identity as outside of Parexel`s own early phase clinical units, Parexel does not hold information that would allow Parexel to directly identify clinical trial / study subjects.

### International Data Transfer

Parexel has self-certified its compliance with both the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. Please click [here](https://www.parexel.com/company/trust-and-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-shield-notice) to view our Privacy Shield Notice.

Parexel is committed to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information we process and has in place mechanisms to ensure a compliant transfer of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S

### Information Security

Parexel maintains a reasonable level of physical, electronic and managerial procedures in order to protect the information that it collects from its website. This includes maintaining computer equipment, networks, programs and documentation to a common standard and restricting access to equipment and information to appropriate staff.

### Children's Privacy

Parexel does not collect or maintain information at its websites from those it knows are under 13 years of age, and no parts of its websites are structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.

### Links to Other Websites

Our websites may contain links to other websites. Please keep in mind when you access websites operated by other parties, whether through links on our websites or otherwise, that we do not control what happens on those websites. You should always check the privacy policy of the website you are visiting in order to be sure you know how the operator of that website will collect information from you and what the operator of that website will do with the information.

### Change Notification and Specific Privacy Terms

As we provide more services on our websites and as privacy laws and regulations evolve, it may be necessary to revise or update our Privacy Policy without notice. You can determine if this Privacy Policy has been revised since your last visit by referring to the "last updated" legend at the bottom of this page.  Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy, and you should therefore review the Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms.  Please print, save, and retain a copy of the Privacy Policy (and of any revised version) for your records.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover any Parexel affiliate or Parexel line of business that operates under its own separate privacy policy or specific privacy terms that are tailored for the different ways your personal information is collected by different Parexel lines of business such as:

  * Service Terms address customer data to which we may be provided access in order to perform services;
  * Recruiting Terms address information we may collect in connection with Parexel´s employment recruiting, clinical trial / study subjects or potential investigator efforts;
