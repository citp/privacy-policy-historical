</div>
<h3>What information do we process?</h3>
We collect the information set out below from you during the registration process and your use of the PARSHIP service. By submitting this information (including sensitive personal information), you are explicitly agreeing to us processing that information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Please remember that due to the nature of the PARSHIP service, any information that is disclosed to PARSHIP, except the guarantees of privacy that are stated below, can become public information. You should therefore exercise caution when disclosing personal information.<div class="ps_editorial_topSpacer">
</div>
<h3>On registration with the website</h3>
On initial registration we collate personal information such as your name, date of birth, e-mail address and postal address. We use this information for administrative purposes and to provide you with the PARSHIP service.

To allow other registered users to be able to view a profile about you PARSHIP creates one from a combination of the registration data and personality test results in the My Profile section, which has links to the part of our service where you can upload photographs of yourself. You are also given the opportunity to change the description of yourself. We use the information you provide about your personal preferences (collated on registration and in the My Profile section) to help match you to a potential partner. Some of this information will be visible by other members, such as age, marital status, height, region, occupation etc. Your name, email address, home address and other specific 'identifier' data will NOT be visible to other users. Please remember that you can choose to delete or hide your profile at any time by selecting the relevant option in the 'My PARSHIP/Data &amp; Settings' section of the website.<div class="ps_editorial_topSpacer">
