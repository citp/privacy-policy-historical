		<p><strong>AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Non-Identifiable Information</strong> – Like many other Websites, this Website automatically collects
														 certain non-identifiable information regarding Website users,
														 such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer,
														 the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and
														 time you access the Website, the Internet address of the
														 Website from which you linked directly to the Website, the
														 operating system you are using, the sections of the Website you
														 visit, the Website pages accessed and information viewed, and
														 the materials you post to or download from the Website. This
														 non-identifiable information is used for Websites and system
														 administration purposes and to improve the Website. Your
														 non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and
														 permanently archived for future use.</p>

		<p><strong>Cookies</strong> – This Website uses “cookies”, a technology that installs information on a Website
									user’s computer to permit the Website to recognize future visits using that
									computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the
									information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of
									the Website, to track your activity at the Website in order to respond to your
									needs, to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to
									automatically populate online forms with your personal information for your
									convenience, and to otherwise facilitate your Website experience.</p>

		<p>Advertisements displayed on the Website may also contain cookies or other technologies. Those advertisements
		   may be provided by third party advertising companies, and LPi does not have any control over, or any
		   responsibility or liability for, the cookies or other technologies used in the advertisements or for use and
		   disclosure of information collected through advertisement cookies. You may choose to decline cookies if your
		   browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of this Website and your ability to access or use certain
		   Website features.</p>

		<p><strong>DATA YOU PROVIDE</strong></p>

		<p>When you use this site you may do things like complete your personal profile, send messages, create content,
		   collaborate about content, and post comments. We collect this information so that we can provide you these
		   services and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return
		   to view prior messages you have sent or easily return to your favorite page.</p>

		<p>You post content on the Website at your own risk. Although we allow you to set preferences and permissions
		   that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We
		   are not responsible for circumvention of any preferences or permissions or security measures contained on the
		   Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of individual Content may remain
		   viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Individuals have copied or stored your Individual
		   Content.</p>

		<p>Profile information is used by LPi primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the
		   service and to be presented to other registered users permitted to view that information by your preferences
		   and permissions.</p>

		<p>LPi may send you service-related announcements from time to time on the services LPi offers its customers.
		   Generally, you may opt out of such e-mails from the preferences and permissions page, though LPi reserves the
		   right to send you notice about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary e-mail notifications.</p>

		<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

		<p>LPi may contain links to other Websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other
		   Websites. We encourage our individuals to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of
		   each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Notice applies solely
		   to information collected on LPi’s Website.</p>

		<p><strong>Third Party Business Partners and Advertising</strong></p>

		<p>Advertisements or information from our business sponsors who support your communities may appear
		   on our Website and are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to individuals by third party advertisers.
		   They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download
		   cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1
		   gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows
		   the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to
		   measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile
		   information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine
		   which advertisements are clicked. LPi does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by
		   the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on LPi
		   unless you choose to share it with them.</p>

		<p>This privacy notice covers the use of cookies by LPi and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking
		   technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>

		<p>LPi may also send you from time to time advertisements from our business sponsors. You may opt out of such
		   e-mails from the preferences and permissions page.</p>

		<p><strong>INFORMATION USED</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Tracking Information</strong> – LPi may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking
												 information reports regarding Website user demographics and the use of
												 this Website, and then provide those reports to others. None of the
												 tracking information in the reports is connected to the identities or
												 other personal information of individual users.</p>

		<p><strong>OTHER MATTERS</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Security</strong> – LPi works to keep our servers, applications and databases secure and free from
									 unauthorized access and use, by using physical, administrative and technological
									 measure to protect the information we maintain. Unfortunately, no one can guarantee
									 100% security. If you have particular security concerns about certain personal

											collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. You should
											review the privacy policies of those other Websites and Internet resources
											to understand how they collect and use information.</p>
