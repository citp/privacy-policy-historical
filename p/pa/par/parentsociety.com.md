# Privacy Policy | Parent Society | Parent Society

**Privacy Policy**

 **Company Practices**

The following statement describes the overall company practices of ParentSociety (A Parent Media Group, Inc. company), along with its other affiliate and subsidiary companies (collectively “ParentSociety”), including advertising on its own network of websites as well as products and services offered by ParentSociety. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ParentSociety does not own or control, or to people that ParentSociety does not employ.

ParentSociety is very aware of the need to respect, and protect the privacy of its visitors. This privacy policy (“Policy”) discloses the data collection methods and data usage practices of ParentSociety (www.ParentSociety.com).

Because this Policy pertains to information collected only directly through or from the ParentSociety network of sites, this Policy does not apply to personal information collected from offline resources and communications (for instance, if you send us a postal letter or give us a phone call). This Policy also does not apply to third party online resources to which the ParentSociety network of websites may link, where ParentSociety does not control the content, nor the privacy practices.

Please read this Policy carefully. Should any questions arise about this Policy or our data collection, use or disclosure practices, please contact us in any of the ways listed at the end of this Policy. Please also be sure to read our complete Terms of Use, of which this Privacy Policy is a part.

 **What is Non-Personally Identifiable Data?**

With respect to individuals who visit the ParentSociety network of sites, we, and/or one or more of our third party advertising technology vendors, may collect what is known as “Click Stream Data.” Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a visitor’s IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a visitor to an advertisement and content delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1×1 pixels). As a part of the registration process at ParentSociety properties, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age, gender, and geographic location. None of the aforementioned information (collectively referred to as “non-personally identifiable data”), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual.

 **What is Personally Identifiable Information?**

The term “personally identifiable information” as used in this Policy means any information or set of information that identifies a specific individual. ParentSociety is committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all consumers before the personally identifiable data is collected, and that they have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address and email address. Additionally, visitors may volunteer sensitive health information such as conditions, medication(s) used and other sensitive information about themselves and/or family members. Visitors who have provided personally identifiable information and sensitive health information may elect to have their data deactivated from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the instructions described in the “Contact Us” section of this Policy. Should you elect to have your data deactivated from our files, please note that you will also compromise your future ability to log into ParentSociety sites.

 **How is Information Used?**

When you volunteer information on ParentSociety sites, personal information including name, email, birth date and gender is used to create your account profile. Once registered, you have the option to create a profile with more detailed information.

When you select to email, or tell a friend about ParentSociety sites, we request their email address to send them a one- time email inviting them to ParentSociety sites. This information is not used for any purposes beyond that for which it has been provided.

In addition, declared visitor information may also be appended with additional information from external sources — this is done to enrich your personalized experience while visiting our sites (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that may interest you). ParentSociety may also compare its own visitor list to lists received from third party companies, in an effort to provide better service.

We may use information collected in numerous ways, including but not limited to:

• Providing personalized information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;

• Targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;

• Contacting visitors for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or postal mail;

• Providing general and administrative information about membership via electronic delivery and/or postal mail;

• Feedback on product development;

• Feedback on editorial, marketing and promotional purposes;

• Improving the content and layout of ParentSociety sites;

• Statistical analysis of visitor behavior;

• Targeting advertising messages to visitors using ParentSociety third party technology partners once visitors leave the ParentSociety network of sites;

• Contacting visitors regarding account status and changes to the Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement, Terms of Use and other policies and agreements;

• Providing contact information to ParentSociety marketing partners you have explicitly authorized us to share your information with, and whose offers you have elected to receive via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail; and

• Disclosing personal information to ParentSociety service providers who provide support for ParentSociety ongoing operations (e.g., to provide email newsletters). Please note that these providers will be instructed to contact you only if you request them to do so.

ParentSociety does not send or support the delivery of unsolicited bulk e-mail (a.k.a. “spam”).

While ParentSociety may undertake efforts to see that any third party with whom ParentSociety shares personal information is under contractual obligation to use the personal information solely for the purposes for which the information was disclosed, such third parties are independent third parties over which ParentSociety exercises no control. ParentSociety is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.

 **Third-party Advertising**

ParentSociety uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our websites. Third party advertising companies may also be utilized by ParentSociety to target display advertising to you once you leave the ParentSociety network of sites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. It is solely the visitors’ obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these advertisers and their associated third parties. These advertisers and their associated third parties are independent entities over which ParentSociety exercises no control. ParentSociety is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.

Third party advertising companies may also be utilized by ParentSociety to target display advertising to you once you leave the ParentSociety network of sites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

 **Cookies**

ParentSociety may place “cookies” on a visitor’s computer. Cookies are small text files that save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing ParentSociety to recognize a visitor (thereby foregoing the mandatory step of having to re-enter your password each time you visit ParentSociety sites), and help ParentSociety deliver personalized content and other services. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting ParentSociety sites may result in certain parts of the sites not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed access to cookies. For example, if you are a ParentSociety member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the Web Site.

Third-party advertising companies that ParentSociety may partner with, as referenced above, may also employ cookies and web beacons (also known as 1×1 GIFs) to measure advertising effectiveness, delivery & targeting of messages. Please note that these companies are independent third parties over which ParentSociety exercises no control. ParentSociety is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.

 **Legal Disclosure**

ParentSociety may disclose information about you and your use of the ParentSociety sites and services if ParentSociety believes that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

(i) Comply with the law and/or legal process where a formal request has been made (e.g. request from an administrative oversight agency, civil suit, subpoena, court order or judicial or administrative proceeding);

(ii) Protect or defend the rights and/or property of ParentSociety or others;

(iii) Enforce the ParentSociety [Terms and Conditions](http://parentsociety.com/terms-and-conditions/ "Terms and conditions") and/or this Privacy Policy; (iv) Respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another.

Also, circumstances may arise where, for business reasons, ParentSociety may decide to reorganize, or divest all or part of its business through sale, assignment, merger or acquisition. In these circumstances, personal information may be shared with the actual or prospective purchasers or assignees. In such an event, we shall provide notice of any material change to this Privacy Policy, or our services, in the manner described in the Updates section of this Privacy Policy below.

 **Reports**

We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the ParentSociety sites and services. These reports include aggregate information about ParentSociety visitors and members. The information in these reports will not identify individuals. Any ParentSociety business partner with whom such reports may be shared will also not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports.

 **Give-Aways and Contests**

We may conduct give-aways, contests and other promotions on the ParentSociety network of sites in which we may ask you for additional information. We use and treat this information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Participation in such give-aways and contents is not necessary to use the ParentSociety network of sites, and you may choose whether you wish to participate in any particular give-away or contest, without affecting your general use of the Site.

 **Security**

ParentSociety has implemented extensive security measures intended to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under its control. Our hardware infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access to authorized individuals with positive identification. Our network access to the infrastructure is protected by a firewall protection system. Member information is backed up on a regular basis to protect against accidental loss. When you enter personally identifiable information (e.g. registration, health profile questions, surveys), we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your information during its transmission across the Internet. We use VeriSign digital ID to confirm that you’re actually using the ParentSociety network of sites, and have not been diverted to a fake site by hackers. We restrict the access our staff has to your information. Third-party marketing partners receive your information only under substantial restrictions, imposed by you and/or us, described elsewhere in this Policy. Our offices are protected with a key-card entry system, security guards, and other measures.

However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and ParentSociety will not be intercepted by others, and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion. The confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from ParentSociety via this Web Site, or via e-mail cannot be and is not guaranteed. Accordingly, ParentSociety is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.

If you prefer not to communicate with us via e-mail, or the Internet, ParentSociety can be contacted by regular mail at 265 Sunrise Hwy. Unit 1, Suite 161, Rockville Centre, N.Y. 11570.

Please note that ParentSociety will never request your personal information by sending e-mails. We only collect such information on our website. If you receive an e-mail solicitation purporting to be from us, please do not respond to it. Instead, please contact us immediately.

 **Children**

ParentSociety services and websites are not directed at children and are designed for individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We will not request or knowingly collect information from an individual under 13 years of age.

 **Links**

The ParentSociety network of sites, as well as the electronic messages sent as part of our services, may contain links to other sites or services. ParentSociety is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those other sites, please contact them directly.

To request that information which had previously been voluntarily provided be removed from our database, send an e-mail request to Contact(at)ParentSociety(dot)com.

At the current time, we are not able to offer users the ability to delete all information from our database. Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed from our database, you will be unsubscribed from our services.
