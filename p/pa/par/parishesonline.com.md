 **Automatically Collected Information**

Like many other websites, this website automatically collects certain non-identifiable information regarding website users, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the website, the operating system you are using, the sections of the website you visit, the website pages accessed and information viewed, and the materials you post to, or download from the website. This non-identifiable information is used for websites and system administration purposes and to improve the website. Your non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.

 **Cookies**

This website uses “cookies,” a technology that installs information on a website user’s computer to permit the website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the website. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the website, to track your activity at the website in order to respond to your needs, to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to automatically populate online forms with your personal information for your convenience, and to otherwise facilitate your website experience.

Advertisements displayed on the website may also contain cookies or other technologies. Those advertisements may be provided by third-party advertising companies, and LPi does not have any control over, or any responsibility or liability for, the cookies or other technologies used in the advertisements or for use and disclosure of information collected through advertisement cookies. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of this website and your ability to access or use certain website features.

 **Data You Provide**

When you use this site, you may do things like complete your personal profile, send messages, create content, collaborate about content, and post comments. We collect this information so that we can provide you these services and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily return to your favorite church.

You post content on the website at your own risk. Although we allow you to set preferences and permissions that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any preferences or permissions or security measures contained on the website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Individual Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other individuals have copied or stored your Individual Content.

Profile information is used by LPi primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to other registered users permitted to view that information by your preferences and permissions.

LPi may send you service-related announcements from time to time on the services LPi offers its customers. Generally, you may opt out of such e-mails from the preferences and permissions page, though LPi reserves the right to send you notice about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary e-mail notifications.

 **Links**

LPi may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our individuals to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Notice applies solely to information collected on LPi’s websites.

 **Third-Party Business Partners and Advertising**

Advertisements or information from our business sponsors who support your communities and churches may appear on our website and are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly to individuals by third-party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third-party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known as “1×1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. LPi does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on LPi unless you choose to share it with them.

This privacy notice covers the use of cookies by LPi and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

From time to time, LPi may send you advertisements from our business sponsors. You may opt out of such e-mails from the Preferences and Permissions Page. ****

**Our Use and Disclosure of Information**

 **Internal Uses**

We collect, store, and process your personal information on servers located in the United States. We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to improve our products and services.

We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests.

LPi may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding website user demographics and the use of this website, and then provide those reports to others. None of the tracking information in the reports is connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users.

 **Disclosure to Other LPi Customers Using WeShare**

If you are a registered WeShare user, your name, e-mail address, address, phone number and some credit card or bank account information are displayed to non-profit benefactors you choose to donate to. If you are a non-profit benefactor account holder, we will also display to other WeShare customers the account profile information such as website, email address, phone number and address that you provide us. However, your credit card number, bank account or routing number and other financial information will NEVER be revealed to anyone whom you have sent money to or received money through your WeShare account, except with your express written permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.

We work with third party non-profit benefactor to enable them to accept donations from you, including direct credit card or bank account information. Non-profit benefactors who use this service will share personally identifiable information you provide to them with WeShare in order to validate the information, or confirm the existence or status of your WeShare account. You permit LPi to share information with the merchant on the validity of the personally identifiable information you provided to the non-profit benefactor and on the existence or status of your WeShare account.

 **Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than LPi Customers using WeShare**

LPi will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. LPi will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below or with your express permission (and with other LPi customers as described above). These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared.

  1. We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customers’ transactions from fraud. Additionally, if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share information with processing companies including collection agencies.
  2. We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity’s contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.
  3. We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver, or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.
  4. We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant or a guardian appointed for you).
  5. We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in California. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.
  6. As with any other business, it is possible that LPi in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by LPi, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above.



 **Our Contacts with LPi Customers using WeShare**

We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of a WeShare account, to send you notice of donations that you send or receive through WeShare, to send information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of some of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.

We also use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including the non-profit benefactor newsletter. You can choose whether to receive some, all, or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the WeShare website and changing your preferences in the Email Addresses page of the Personal Info tab.

In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

 **OTHER MATTERS**

 **Security** —LPi works to keep our servers, applications, and databases secure and free from unauthorized access and use by using physical, administrative, and technological measures to protect the information we maintain.
