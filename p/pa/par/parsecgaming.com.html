<li class="alpha-list"><strong>Information Collected via Technology. </strong>
<ul class="sub-list">
<li><u>Information Collected by Our Servers</u>. To make the Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>
<li><u>Log Files</u>. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (<strong>“ISP”</strong>), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site and Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some information may be collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and the information can then be used to serve information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</li>

<li><u>Pixel Tag</u> In addition, we use <strong>“pixel tags</strong>” (also referred to as clear GIFs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our users’ Personal Data.</li>
<li><u>Do Not Track Signals</u>.Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">Do Not Track</a>.</li>
<li><u>Flash LSOs</u>. When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “<strong>flash cookies</strong>,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for flash cookies, click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>.</li>
