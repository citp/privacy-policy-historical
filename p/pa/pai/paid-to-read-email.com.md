# Paid To Read Email® - Earn Cash for Paid Surveys

The purpose of Paid To Read Email is to offer Internet users an effective tool for getting email messages that they are interested in. In addition, Paid To Read Email has developed the web technology to enable businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized ways without forfeiting the privacy of the consumer. Privacy is a critical element of Paid To Read Email. Our Privacy Policy is an evolving document and as such will be updated periodically. We welcome feedback about the guidelines outlined in our policy.

1\. Paid To Read Email will control all information collected as a result of your membership in Paid To Read Email.

  


### 3rd Party Disclosure

Customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without the consent of the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested by the customer.

  
2\. In our online registration form, we require you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself including full name, address, and email address. We then require that our members complete a short demographic profile. We will process this information to administer your membership and to enable you to take advantage of other member benefits. We will process this membership and demographic information to build a profile of your interests and activities so that we can send you surveys, offers and other benefits that are most likely to be of interest to you. As we aggregate this type of information about all of our members, we do not disclose our members' names, addresses, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information to any third parties.

  


### Private Information Security

For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, PayPal, keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf. Paid To Read Email is not responsible for the security of your private information that you are using on our partner web sites.

  
3\. We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Paid To Read Email and/or when you report a problem with any of our services.

Paid To Read Email may retain and reference aggregate information about member preferences gathered in these ways.

  
4\. Paid To Read Email utilizes 'cookies' for convenience so that members will not have to login to the site each time they visit. A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered into the memory of your computer. In this case, it is used to remember your username and password. Most cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies, if your browser permits, or to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion.

5\. We use your email address to verify your identity and protect against fraud and to contact you when necessary.
