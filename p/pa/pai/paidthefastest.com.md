Demographic information includes, but is not limited to: home address, phone number, birth date, and gender.

Means of Collection

The only way to join PaidTheFastest is through our online registration. We do not acquire Users through purchase, co-registration, or any other means. Our servers automatically log certain access details for each website visitor, including domain, IP address, time of access, referring site and content accessed. This information is collected not only to prevent fraud, but to improve site content and internally for marketing purposes.

User information is used by PaidTheFastest in all of the following, but not limited to, ways:

(a) E-Mail Address is used to confirm email and/or send payment via PayPal (b) Mailing Address is used to send payments earned by member if requested (c) Username/Email and Password are used for member protection to restrict access to their account (d) PaidTheFastest cannot be held responsible for information that you provide to advertisers linked through our site

Sharing of Information 

  
PaidTheFastest does not rent, sell, or share member information, except in the following circumstances:

(a) We are required by law to release member information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes (b) We suspect a member of committing fraud, in which case member information may be shared during the course of our investigation (c) We share User information when co-registration boxes (explained below) are checked during the course of registration.

CO-REGISTRATION 

PaidTheFastest offer pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where members can choose to "co-register" for other Web Sites during their registration with PaidTheFastest by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Members are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join PaidTheFastest ; however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions.

Information Sharing 

  
When a member co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to PaidTheFastest may be shared with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. PaidTheFastest cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.

COOKIES 

  
Referral and Affiliate Tracking 

  
PaidTheFastest uses cookies in order to track new member registrations and offer completions. This ensures members are properly credited for referring other members and completing offers, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates.

Cookies 

Cookies used by PaidTheFastest can only be seen by PaidTheFastest, and cannot in any way cause harm to your computer. Because we cannot properly track member actions without the use of Cookies (to ensure members are credited for completing Offers, referring friends, etc), our Web Site will not function properly for members who have disabled Cookies.
