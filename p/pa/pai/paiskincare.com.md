We are customers ourselves of other Internet sites and and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so. 

## Your Consent

We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information or personal information to any third party.
