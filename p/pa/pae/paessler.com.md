### Implementation of „Cookies"

Upon registration, and upon every subsequent log-on by a registered user, and when accessing the shop, session cookies are stored on your machine in order to provide an appealing visit to our website and to allow access to certain functions. This does not, however, include any form of personal data but merely a personal session ID which is applied during the visit. These session IDs reference internally stored data, for example information concerning the content of the shopping cart. In this manner it is possible to comfortably continue shopping when accessing our page at a later time.

The cookies generated have an expiry time of 90 days. Beyond that, it is possible to delete the stored cookies from within the browser at any given time.

### Implementation of „Conversion Tracking"

In order to measure the success of our Google AdWords campaign, we use the Google's „Conversion Tracking" process. If you access our page via a Google advertisement and then place an order Google sets a cookie that protocols the process for statistical purposes. In such an instance no personal data is transmitted. The only entries recorded are the purchase time, the product value, as well as the respective AdWords ad.

### Safe Data Transfer Via SSL

For purchase processes we use the commonly implemented SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection mechanism in conjunction with the highest encryption level available from your browser. Generally this entails 256-Bit encryption. In case your browser does not support 256-Bit encryption we use 128-Bit v3 technology.

If one of our Internet pages is processed with encryption can be discerned by the closed key, respectively lock icon in the lower status bar of the browser.
