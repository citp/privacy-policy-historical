## Privacy Policy

## We are fully committed to protecting your privacy! 

Aside from non-personalized cookie-based session tracking (as used by most standard website statistics), which does not involve storage of any personal information whatsoever, we do not track usage of individual anonymous visitors to our websites, nor do we store any personal information of anonymous users with regard to IP addresses or cookies. 

When you purchase software from our company (usually through our Online Store) under German tax legislation, we are required to store your address and purchase data. Part of this information is also stored to allow you to log into our website. If you log into our website with this personal login information (i.e. to gain access to product downloads and your personal license keys) we will log some of your activity for security purposes. 

All registered users are notified about new versions of the products they have purchased on a regular basis. We send our newsletter "PaesslerNews" to all customers that have bought a product, and also to everyone opting into our PaesslerNews newsletter. At any time you may ask to be excluded or removed from these mailings, and an unsubscribe link is always provided at the end of every newsletter. 

We will not give away your address and other personal information - be it as a customer, trial user or newsletter subscriber - to any third-party at any time.
