Each time a user accesses a page of this web presence and each time a file is retrieved, data on these operations is stored in a logfile. This data includes the page from which the request originated (if communicated by your browser), the name of the requested file, the date and time of the request, the amount of data transferred, the notification if the request was successful, the description of the browser type used (if communicated by your browser), and the IP address of the machine forwarding the request. The storage of this data exclusively serves internal, system-related, and statistical purposes.

2\. For pseudonymized use analysis and advertising success measurement

This website uses various third-party services to create pseudonymized or anonymous information about the way the website is used and to better match content offers to users. For this purpose, pseudonymized data about the page usage such as the time, duration, and type of the page request, as well as information about the browsers, regional origin, and technology used is transmitted to the respective service. For further details, including the possibility to object, see the specific service.

**Google Analytics** : Web analytics service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Information about your use of this website is transmitted to a Google server in the USA, where it is stored and used to generate anonymized reports on the use of the website and activities within the online offer. We would like to point out that on this website, Google Analytics has been extended by the code "get._anonymizeIP ();" to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses.

Possibility to object: You can object to this data processing by installing or allowing an opt-out cookie that prevents data transmission. Alternatively, you can install an extension in your browser that prevents data transfer. Such an extension can be downloaded here <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

3\. For pseudonymized advertising

**Google Adwords** : Advertisements by means of cookies: You can be recognized as a visitor of the website, without your identity being known, via the set cookies so that when you visit other websites, the corresponding advertisements are displayed. In addition, internet users with specific profiles of interest based on their internet usage might be shown the corresponding advertisements. We do not collect any personal data with our cookies, remarketing lists, or other anonymous IDs.

For the use of trial and freeware and their operation, we collect and store your email address. Paessler uses this information to send you your license key, to guide you through the installation, to clarify typical questions that arise during installation, and to clarify the status of the installation. This is necessary for purposes of determining and correcting the support requirement during the installation and operation of the software, and to clarify the further use after the end of the test phase. Contacting can also take place over the telephone. Telephone numbers are only collected from publicly available sources.

3\. When using contact forms

The data are processed with the help of the service provider HubSpot and we store them for 6 months, after which period your data will be deleted unless you have become a Paessler AG customer in the meantime or you have filled out a new contact form.

We also use the form service Wufoo. It processes and stores the content that you enter into a contact form. Depending on the type of contact form, this may regard the following content: company, name, email address, telephone number, preferred supplier, invoice number, credit card details, t-shirt size, GitHub repository, and PRTG account email. The content will only be processed and saved when you submit a form; otherwise, Wufoo only tracks the view of the form when it is visible on a page.

### D - DATA PROCESSING UPON PURCHASE OF SOFTWARE / SERVICES

1\. For registration / account use

During the purchase of a service, an email address and a password are used to set up an account ("registration"). The data are used to provide you access to your orders and contracts and to process the software purchase.

Upon registration and each time a registered user logs in, session cookies are stored on your machine in order to make the visit to our website more appealing and to enable the use of certain functions. These do not include any personal data, only your session ID, which is assigned to you during your visit. This session ID is used to reference internally stored data, such as information on the contents of your shopping cart so that if you visit our website at a later time, you can comfortably continue shopping. The generated cookies have an expiration time of 90 days.

2\. To process the order

During the ordering process, we collect and store information about your identity and your contact details (in particular, your first and last name, address, telephone number, and email address), as well as information about your purchase and payment method, including bank or credit card data.

This information is used to complete the order, including payment, and to provide the software and purchased services. This includes providing updates so that you can download the most recent version of the software at any time, free of charge, and providing upgrade offers and other services of Paessler AG.

Your email address is also required to review your license and provide you with registration keys or download links, as well as to inform you about the status of maintenance contracts.

Within the ordering process, we use the popular Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption method in conjunction with the highest encryption level supported by your browser. Typically, this is 256-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we will use 128-bit technology instead. A closed lock or a key symbol in the status bar of your browser denotes whether a single page of our website is encrypted.

3\. For payment transactions

Your address and your payment information will be sent to the executing payment and billing service providers:

For PRTG on demand, credit card information is processed by Stripe Inc. Headquarters, 185 Berry Street, Suite 550, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. For more information on Stripe's privacy policy, please visit: <https://stripe.com/us/privacy>. Invoicing is processed by Chargebee Inc., 340 S. Lemon Ave # 1537, Walnut, CA, 91789, USA.

4\. For credit assessment and payment delay

When paying via invoice, a credit assessment check is carried out before this type of payment is granted due to prevailing justifiable protection of interests. For this purpose, information about your creditworthiness is collected from credit agencies and used for evaluation purposes. If you object to the collection of your credit information, please choose another payment method.

If your payment is delayed, we reserve the right to transfer your personal data to a debt collection agency or to a law firm commissioned by us to ensure the collection of the outstanding amounts. This data transfer is subject to the requirements as per § 28a BDSG.

5\. Anonymized for software updates and generation of usage statistics

Software products from Paessler AG can periodically connect to Paessler AG servers to check for newer software versions and / or important security updates. During this connection, impersonal information about the PRTG installation (for example, sensor count) is also transmitted. We store and use this information, for instance, to optimize the delivery of updates as well as for statistical analysis. This information cannot be associated with a user.

We also generate statistics about the actual use of our software products and apps for mobile devices. This can provide us with valuable information for the continuous development of our products. The information is collected and generated in an anonymized form only.

6\. For advertising purposes

Paessler uses your data and your email address to send you offers for other services and products. You can object to this at any time. Please send a complaint to [[email protected]](https://www.paessler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
