<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Upon registration, and upon every subsequent log-on by a registered user, and when accessing the shop, session cookies are stored on your machine in order to provide an appealing visit to our website and to allow access to certain functions. This does not, however, include any form of personal data but merely a personal session ID which is applied during the visit. These session IDs reference internally stored data, for example information concerning the content of the shopping cart. In this manner it is possible to comfortably continue shopping when accessing our page at a later time.</p>
<p>The cookies generated have an expiry time of 90 days.</p>
<p>To analyze the success of our online ads, our website and our Paessler newsletter statistically, cookies of third parties may be stored on your computer, e.g. if you visit our website by clicking on one of our advertisements at search engines (e.g. Google Adwords, Microsoft adCenter) or on a link in our newsletter. We also use software for conversion tracking (Urchin) that store cookies on your computer.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it is possible to delete the stored cookies from your computer within the browser at any given time.</p>
<h3>Safe Data Transfer Via SSL</h3>
<p>For purchase processes we use the commonly implemented SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection mechanism in conjunction with the highest encryption level available from your browser. Generally this entails 256-Bit encryption. In case your browser does not support 256-Bit encryption we use 128-Bit v3 technology.</p>
<p>If one of our Internet pages is processed with encryption can be discerned by the closed key, respectively lock icon in the lower status bar of the browser is shown.</p></div><div class="pageelement active divider2" id="dividersegment-7461">

<p>The consent to use your email address for the forwarding of our newsletter can be revoked at any time by using the „Unsubscribe" link at the end of any newsletter.</p>
<p>The consent to store your personal data can be revoked at any time after the storage period required by German law.</p>
<p>We do not provide your data to any third parties.</p>
