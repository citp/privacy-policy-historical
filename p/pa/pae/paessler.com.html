This is necessary for purposes of determining and correcting the support requirement during the installation and operation of the software, and to clarify the further use after the end of the test phase. Contacting can also take place over the telephone. Telephone numbers are only collected from publicly available sources.</p> <p>3.

For registration / account use</p> <p>During the purchase of a service, an email address and a password are used to set up an account ("registration"). The data are used to provide you access to your orders and contracts and to process the software purchase.</p> <p>Upon registration and each time a registered user logs in, session cookies are stored on your machine in order to make the visit to our website more appealing and to enable the use of certain functions. These do not include any personal data, only your session ID, which is assigned to you during your visit. This session ID is used to reference internally stored data, such as information on the contents of your shopping cart so that if you visit our website at a later time, you can comfortably continue shopping. The generated cookies have an expiration time of 90 days.</p> <p>2. To process the order</p> <p>During the ordering process, we collect and store information about your identity and your contact details (in particular, your first and last name, address, telephone number, and email address), as well as information about your purchase and payment method, including bank or credit card data.</p> <p>This information is used to complete the order, including payment, and to provide the software and purchased services. This includes providing updates so that you can download the most recent version of the software at any time, free of charge, and providing upgrade offers and other services of Paessler AG.</p> <p>Your email address is also required to review your license and provide you with registration keys or download links, as well as to inform you about the status of maintenance contracts.</p> <p>Within the ordering process, we use the popular Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption method in conjunction with the highest encryption level supported by your browser. Typically, this is 256-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we will use 128-bit technology instead. A closed lock or a key symbol in the status bar of your browser denotes whether a single page of our website is encrypted.</p> <p>3. For payment transactions</p> <p>Your address and your payment information will be sent to the executing payment and billing service providers:</p> <p>For PRTG on demand, credit card information is processed by Stripe Inc. Headquarters, 185 Berry Street, Suite 550, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

For credit assessment and payment delay</p> <p>When paying via invoice, a credit assessment check is carried out before this type of payment is granted due to prevailing justifiable protection of interests. For this purpose, information about your creditworthiness is collected from credit agencies and used for evaluation purposes. If you object to the collection of your credit information, please choose another payment method.</p> <p>If your payment is delayed, we reserve the right to transfer your personal data to a debt collection agency or to a law firm commissioned by us to ensure the collection of the outstanding amounts. This data transfer is subject to the requirements as per § 28a BDSG.</p> <p>5. Anonymized for software updates and generation of usage statistics</p> <p>Software products from Paessler AG can periodically connect to Paessler AG servers to check for newer software versions and / or important security updates. During this connection, impersonal information about the PRTG installation (for example, sensor count) is also transmitted. We store and use this information, for instance, to optimize the delivery of updates as well as for statistical analysis. This information cannot be associated with a user.</p> <p>We also generate statistics about the actual use of our software products and apps for mobile devices. This can provide us with valuable information for the continuous development of our products. The information is collected and generated in an anonymized form only.</p> <p>6. For advertising purposes</p> <p>Paessler uses your data and your email address to send you offers for other services and products. You can object to this at any time.
