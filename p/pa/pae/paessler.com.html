<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Upon registration, and upon every subsequent log-on by a registered  user, and when accessing the shop, session cookies are stored on your  machine in order to provide an appealing visit to our website and to  allow access to certain functions. This does not, however, include any  form of personal data but merely a personal session ID which is applied  during the visit. These session IDs reference internally stored data,  for example information concerning the content of the shopping cart. In  this manner it is possible to comfortably continue shopping when  accessing our page at a later time.</p>
<p>The cookies generated have an expiry time of 90 days.</p>
<p>To analyze the success of our online ads, our website and our Paessler newsletter statistically, cookies of third parties may be stored on your computer, e.g. if you visit our website by clicking on one of our advertisements at search engines (e.g. Google Adwords, Microsoft adCenter) or on a link in our newsletter. We also use software for conversion tracking (Urchin) that store cookies on your computer.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it  is possible to delete the stored cookies from your computer within the browser at any  given time.</p>
<h3>Safe Data Transfer Via SSL</h3>
<p>For purchase processes we use the commonly implemented SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection mechanism in conjunction with the highest encryption level available from your browser. Generally this entails 256-Bit encryption. In case your browser does not support 256-Bit encryption we use 128-Bit v3 technology.</p>
<p>If one of our Internet pages is processed with encryption can be discerned by the closed key, respectively lock icon in the lower status bar of the browser is shown.</p>
<h2>Collection And Processing of Personal Information</h2>
<h3>Software Purchase</h3>
<p>During a purchase we collect and process personal data (particularly first and last names, address, telephone number and email address). When you purchase software online we must further register and store your IP address for ten years, as required by German law.</p>
<p>A part of this data is also retained in our updates center in order to provide you the possibility to download the most current version of the software at no extra cost. This also allows us to provide you with upgrade offers, as well as other services provided by Paessler AG. Your email address is necessary in order to verify your license information and to allow access to license keys and download links.</p>
<p>The consent to store your email address is processed at the successful completion of a purchase. We forward you not only license information (license key and download link) but also use these means to inform you about necessary maintenance extensions, among others.</p>
<p>The consent to use your email address for the forwarding of our  newsletter can be revoked at any time by using the „Unsubscribe" link at  the end of any newsletter.</p>
<p>The consent to store your personal data can be revoked at any time after the storage period required by German law.</p>
<p>We do not provide your data to any third parties.</p>
<h3>Email Newsletter Registration</h3>
<p>When registering for our newsletter, we store the email provided in order to forward you information about our products and any new implementations or special offers. The address provided is not used for any other purposes, nor is it forwarded to third parties.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>
<h3>Statutory Basis</h3>

<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>For the implementation of our website we use carefully selected service providers to process the contract data. Our service providers do not count as a third party as regards the data privacy statement.</p>
<h3>Credit Assessment And Payment Delay</h3>
<p>When ordering via invoice we reserve the right to a credit assessment to ensure our legal interests.</p>
<p>Should your payment be delayed we reserve the right to provide personal data to a debt collection company or, alternatively, a legal chancellery appointed by us. Your legally protected interests are accounted for according to any legal stipulations that may apply.</p>
