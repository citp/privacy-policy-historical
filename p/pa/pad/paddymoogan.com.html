<p><br>
<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?")
and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may
include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web

<p><strong>3. How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong><br>
Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the products and services you

<p><strong>4. What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks
your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own
cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would
prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse
cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.</p>

<p>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</p>

<p><strong>5. How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?<br></strong>As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security.
Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which
parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not
allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us
in your cookies.</p>

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the
network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as
traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>

<p><strong>7. Sharing and Selling Information</strong><br>

that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual address.</p>

<p><strong>9. What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</strong><br>
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the
protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our
users and the Public.</p>

<p><strong>12. Our Commitment To Data Security:<br></strong>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in
the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or
citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information
(such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the
winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>

Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information
to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</p>

and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>

<p><strong>17. Policy Modifications<br></strong>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy
policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However,
please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this
Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</p>
