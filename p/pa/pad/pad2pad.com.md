Pad2Pad.com respects your privacy choices. If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy.

Pad2Pad.com encourages you to read this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit. Below is a summary of Pad2Pad.com's online privacy policy.

Pad2Pad.com is sensitive to the improper use of conventional mailings and e-mailings. We do not supply e-mail addresses to third parties. We occasionally use e-mail addresses to notify customers of relevant new software updates and related news but we keep such use to a minimum - normally less than four messages per year. If you wish to remove your e-mail address from our files reply with REMOVE in the Subject field.

Your drawing file is only sent to us from the CAD application when:

  * You place an order
  * Send us a Troubleshooting or Suggestion message
  * A crash occurs (so developers can correct any issues) - you can disable this in Preference settings if you prefer



We protect the personal information you share with us. For example, if you make an online order with us, we encrypt your credit card number.

Authorized third parties may need access to some of your personal information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We limit such third parties in their access and use of your personal information.

Please [contact us](http://www.pad2pad.com/company/contact.htm) with any questions or comments on our privacy practices.

Pad2Pad.com is committed to user privacy in our products and services.
