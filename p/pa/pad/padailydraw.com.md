If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on the Site, we will delete the information from our records.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

For each user, our web server automatically recognizes the user's domain name and IP address, but not the e-mail address (unless supplied independently by a user).

To qualify to receive access to the Website and/or Service, subject to the requirements set forth in our _[EULA and Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20091128082311id_/http%3A//www.padailydraw.com/DFTemplates/Disclaimers/PA_DD/PA_DD_EULA.html)_ , we gather personal information from you in order to establish your Prize America Daily Draw membership account, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, postal mailing address, mobile telephone number and other demographic information.  We may also collect credit/debit card information for payment and/or age verification purposes.  **IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SUPPLY TO US VALID AND ACCURATE PERSONAL INFORMATION; SUCH INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO SUPPLY THE SERVICE TO YOU AND TO COLLECT PAYMENT FOR SUCH SERVICE.**   We may also collect information related to your online activities to more accurately target and measure our advertising inventory including, without limitation, the places you visit at the Website, content accessed and associated marketing metrics (such as e-mails opened and responded to) (collectively, your “Marketing Profile”). 

In addition, if you choose to participate in any offer available at or through the Website which is offered by us and/or a third party, any personal information submitted by you shall be subject to the privacy policy of the respective third party which is collecting such personal information.  In addition, you may find links to other websites from our Website.  Please be aware that Prize America Daily Draw is not responsible for the privacy practices of other third parties and/or websites.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website. 

**Use of Information Obtained by Prize America Daily Draw**

You understand and agree that Prize America Daily Draw may use and share your personal information with third parties as needed to supply the Service to you. For example, if you want to use a ringtone that you created on your mobile device, we will transfer your mobile telephone number and the location of the ringtone to a service provider, who will then transmit the ringtone to your mobile device for your personal use.

You understand and agree our advertising relationships allow us to make Prize America Daily Draw available to you.  Accordingly, the information that you submit to Prize America Daily Draw remains your property, but by participating in the Prize America Daily Draw service, you grant us the right to use such information and your Marketing Profile for marketing purposes including, but not limited to, sharing such information with third parties.  Prize America Daily Draw may use such information to directly market certain offers to you including, without limitation, via e-mail marketing, telemarketing, direct mail and mobile telephone text messaging (including, without limitation, SMS and/or MMS), to monitor compliance with our Terms and Conditions and for content improvement and feedback purposes.  We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our users. These businesses may include, but are not limited to providers of online, e-mail, telemarketing and direct mail marketing services and applications including, without limitation, lookup and reference, data enhancement, overlay, appending, suppression and validation. 

In addition to marketing purposes, Prize America Daily Draw reserves the right to release user information: (a) in the event that we believe that the Website and/or Service is being or has been used in violation of the Terms and Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (b) if the information is subpoenaed or requested by a court, governmental agency or law enforcement entity; or (c) if Prize America Daily Draw is sold, transferred and/or acquired.  Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when Prize America Daily Draw®, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. 

In addition, you agree that by registering for an Prize America Daily Draw membership, such act constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the "Rule").  Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, Prize America Daily Draw retains the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute an inquiry and/or application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the Rule and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the Rule.  To the extent that user credit card-specific information and/or social security number is collected by Prize America Daily Draw, said information will be transmitted securely, kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than third party service providers – such as payment processors – who provide services to Prize America Daily Draw and/or consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent. In addition, by submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize Prize America Daily Draw to periodically verify that your credit card account continues to be a valid and active one by various methods including, without limitation, charging and, thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the credit card.  Apart from the foregoing uses, Prize America Daily Draw and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that they have credit card information on file for specific users but they will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the user's prior authorization.

You may receive an e-mail confirming your membership with Prize America Daily Draw, co-registration with Advertisers, as well as promotional marketing of commercial products and services.
