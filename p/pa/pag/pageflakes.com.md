 **Registration**

·         You can use Pageflakes without registering.

·         If you want Pageflakes to remember your settings permanently or if you want to access your personal page from more than one PC you need to register with your email address and a password. In addition this will also protect your account from unauthorized access.

·         When you register we’ll send you a welcome email.

·         We may send you important service announcements on rare occasions. You can unsubscribe from these announcements at any time by sending an email to _unsubscribe@pageflakes.com_.

 **Your settings**

·         You may choose to submit additional information in order to personalize your page (such as a ZIP code to customize your weather forecast).

·         Non-personally identifiable data: When you use an application which has been developed by a third party and has been integrated into the Pageflakes site (or an application that interacts with applications from other sites) it can be necessary to transmit data that you have entered at Pageflakes to the provider of that application. For example, if you enter your ZIP code in order to get local weather information, Pageflakes will transmit your ZIP code to a weather information site to get your weather forecast.

·         Personally identifiable data: You may choose to use third-party applications which require entering additional information or signing in to an existing user account at the application provider. For example, if you choose to access your email from Pageflakes, you need to enter the email host, address and password, which will subsequently be used to receive emails from your email service.
