### Minors’ personal data

**IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS CALAMEO IN ANY MANNER.**

The Calaméo service is not open to minors under the age of 13 and Calaméo collects no personally identifiable information regarding any person under the age of 13. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor under the age of 13 who has become a member of Calaméo, please contact us at [privacy@calameo.com](mailto:privacy@calameo.com) so that his/her account can be closed and the data erased. 

If a minor between the ages of 13 and 15 wishes to register on Calaméo, this registration will only be legal if consent is jointly granted by the minor in question and the holder(s) of parental authority over this minor. The holder(s) of parental authority must transmit photo identification and proof of their relationship with the minor. 

Above the age of 15, a minor may register independently on Calaméo and consent to the processing of his/her personal data. 

Minors have a broadened right to erase personal data collected during their minority. For more information, please contact us at [privacy@calameo.com](mailto:privacy@calameo.com). 

## How do we use your data and for what purposes?

We use the data that we collect to provide and improve our products and services, but also to communicate with you regarding our products, services and offers. 

We may use your personal information to provide customer support, to send you administrative messages (including updates concerning the optimal operation of the service and security notifications), and to respond to messages that you send us. 

We may also use this information to analyze the usage of our site and technical problems that may occur, to reproduce the data in order to ensure its backup, or to process transactions and send you information regarding those transactions. 

Calaméo uses operational information that we collect (such as publications and pages viewed, origin of visit and the date, time and duration of your browsing) to help create an optimal and secure user experience, and in order to improve our service by, for example, providing you with personalized advice. 

Calaméo relies on third-party processors, to whom certain personal information may be transferred, mainly in order to: produce statistics regarding site usage, ensure the backup of platform data, provide user support, process payments, send emails to users and display advertisements that may interest you based on your activity when browsing our site. 

Finally, Calaméo may use your information within the context of marketing and sales operations: 

  * If you have explicitly granted your consent, 
  * If you are already subscribed to one of our paid services and the sales operation concerns a product similar to the one you have already purchased from us, 
  * If you register for our service as part of your professional activity. 



In any case, you may exercise your right to be excluded from these sales and marketing operations by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link present in each message, by updating your preferences in your account Settings or by sending a request to [privacy@calameo.com](mailto:privacy@calameo.com). 

## How long is personal data retained?

Pursuant to the French Data Protection (FDP) act of 6 January 1978 and the European Regulation (GDPR) of 26 April 2016, the personally identifiable information collected by Calaméo is only retained for as long as is required for the purpose of its processing. 

Calaméo ensures that the conservation period is proportional to the purpose of processing for each category of data collected. 

### Summary table showing the conservation period for each data category

Type of data  |  Conservation period   
---|---  
Data relating to an active client   
Set of data relating to managing a user account  |  Throughout the entire duration of the contractual relation   
Data relating to an inactive client – after account deletion   
Contact and identification data  |  5 years after the contract’s end or last contact by the inactive client

In such cases, the conservation period will be equal to the legal requirement or to the establishment, exercise or defense of rights in court. 

## What privacy and security measures are implemented to protect personal data?

Calaméo takes the protection of your personal information seriously and has established security procedures with a view to safeguarding it from unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification. We routinely evaluate our practices, review data security and conduct maintenance to ensure the integrity of the personal information that we collect and store. 

Access to personal information by Calaméo employees and third-party processors is protected and restricted to appropriate use. 

In the event that Calaméo becomes aware of a security breach, we will notify you electronically in a timely manner, except where required not to by law, so that you can take any necessary protection measures. 

When paid by credit or debit card, transactions take place between you and our payment processing partners, recognized for their reliability in online transactions. Transactions are encrypted (SSL encryption process). 

In all of secure zones where the Calaméo URL begins with https:// (where “s” stands for “secured”), the data is encrypted and protected before being sent via the Internet. 

## Does calameo transfer data to third parties?

Calaméo does not transfer any data to third parties for commercial purposes, but rather only to help us improve our services, including processing orders, data storage and backup, security, customer support, data analysis and the improvement of our marketing.

Finally, any individual may make provisions for the exercise of the aforementioned rights after his/her death, within the scope of general guidelines registered with a trusted digital third party certified by the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) or specific guidelines registered with the data processor.
