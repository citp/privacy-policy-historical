## About this Privacy and Security Statement

This Privacy and Security Statement applies to the Web Sites of PageUp People Pty Ltd (ACN 005 630 740) (“PageUp People”).

The purpose of this statement is to let users of the PageUp People web site know what information is collected about them, how this information may be used and if it is disclosed.

Personal information collected by PageUp People is treated as confidential. Personal information is information relating to an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion provided.

PageUp People recognises that your privacy is important to you. We know that providing Personal Information is an act of trust and we take that seriously.

## Information collected

PageUp People does not collect personal information about you when you visit the site. You can generally visit the site without revealing personal information, unless you choose to provide such information. Information you provide PageUp People with directly will be collected, such as through subscribing to our newsletter or completing an online application form. The only personal information we collect is what you tell us about yourself.

If you decide to complete an online application form, the information you enter into the online form will only be collected by us if you submit your online application. If at any stage you cancel your application or log out prior to submitting your application, the information you have entered up to that point will be automatically deleted.

## Cookies

## Security of Information

pageuppeople.com strictly protects the security of your Personal information and honours your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Your Personal Information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as secure. However, PageUp People currently uses 128 Bit SSL encryption, firewalls, restricted physical access and restricted staff access to ensure data is maintained in a secure environment. This ensures the highest level of security possible. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (not encrypted).

PageUp People is constantly monitoring developments in security and encryption technologies.

PageUp People Privacy & Security Statement as an Application Service Provider (ASP) (Third Party)

PageUp People focuses on database software development and is an ASP. As an ASP, PageUp People maintains an array of servers to support client database and web based software applications. Therefore, Personal Information is stored on our servers on their behalf.

Personal Information stored on behalf of clients is treated in the same manner as information collected directly by PageUp People. The only exception would be if a client raises technical or customer support issues that require accessing this information.
