## About this Privacy and Security Statement

This Privacy and Security Statement applies to the Web Sites of PageUp Pty Ltd (ACN 005 630 740) (“PageUp”).

The purpose of this statement is to let users of the PageUp web site know what information is collected about them, how this information may be used and if it is disclosed.

Personal information collected by PageUp is treated as confidential. Personal information is information relating to an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion provided.

PageUp recognises that your privacy is important to you. We know that providing Personal Information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. 

## Information collected 

PageUp does not collect Personal Information about you when you visit the site. You can generally visit the site without revealing Personal Information, unless you choose to provide such information. Information you provide PageUp with directly will be collected, such as through subscribing to our newsletter or completing an online application form. The only Personal Information we collect is what you tell us about yourself. 

If you decide to complete an online application form, the information you enter into the online form will only be collected by us if you submit your online application. If at any stage you cancel your application or log out prior to submitting your application, the information you have entered up to that point will be automatically deleted. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of information that an Internet web site sends to your browser when you access information at that site. Cookies are either stored in memory (session cookies) or placed on your hard disk (persistent cookies). The PageUp Web site does not use persistent cookies. Upon closing your browser the session cookie set by this web site is destroyed and no personal information is maintained which might identify you should you visit our web site at a later date.

## Use and disclosure of Information

PageUp will only record your e-mail address if you choose to send us a message. Your e-mail address will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list or used for any other purpose without your consent, unless required by law. 

## Access to your Personal Information (Online applications)

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your Personal Information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time through the Careers page on the website. 

If you wish to access or modify personal information which you have provided via our website, but cannot access that information at our website, please contact us by sending an email using the Contact Us page, phoning or writing. 

## Access to Information collected

We will, at your request, provide you with access to any information which we have collected about you through this website in accordance with Information Privacy Principle 6, Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), subject to some exceptions allowed by law. To gain access to this information you should contact us (see details below). If you believe any information is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, please contact us. 

## Security of Information

PageUp.com.au strictly protects the security of your Personal Information and honours your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Your Personal Information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as secure. However, PageUp currently uses 128 Bit SSL encryption, firewalls, restricted physical access and restricted staff access to ensure data is maintained in a secure environment. This ensures the highest level of security possible. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (not encrypted).

PageUp is constantly monitoring developments in security and encryption technologies.

PageUp Privacy & Security Statement as an Application Service Provider (ASP) (Third Party)

PageUp focuses on database software development and is an ASP. As an ASP, PageUp maintains an array of servers to support client database and web based software applications. Therefore, Personal Information is stored on our servers on their behalf.

Personal Information stored on behalf of clients is treated in the same manner as information collected directly by PageUp. The only exception would be if a client raises technical or customer support issues that require accessing this information.
