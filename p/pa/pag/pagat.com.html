<h2 id="policy">Aims of the site</h2>
<p>
By publishing rules of games, I am not suggesting that there is a single "correct" way to play each game. Most card games have a large number of minor variations and house rules - to play successfully, it is only necessary that the players should all agree on the rules at the start of a session. Where possible, I try to make sure that the rules given here are "authentic" - the aim is that they should correspond to the way regular players of the game actually play it. If there are significant variations, I try to include these as options. For games with official organisations and rules, official rules may be given, but unofficial alternative versions may also be included.
</p><p>
The main focus is on publishing rules of traditional card games for two or more players. I use the term traditional card games to distinguish them from
</p><ul>
<li><strong>commercial games</strong> - games designed to be played with special equipment bought from the publisher of the game
</li><li><strong>solitaire or patience games</strong> - games for one player
</li><li><strong>invented games</strong> - games which do not yet have a well established tradition of play independent of the original inventor(s)
</li></ul>
<p>
For traditional multi-player card games, I estimate that the site so far covers at most 30% to 50% of the card games that exist, depending on how you count variations, so there is plenty more work to be done, and all help is gratefully received. Originally I intended to focus on games which were hard to find elsewhere - for example in the widely available books about card games - but there turned out also to be a demand for pages on well-known games such as Bridge, Poker and Canasta, so these have been included as well. The mix of material which is now on the site has been influenced by the contributions people have offered me, by the questions I have been asked, and by my own personal tastes. There is plenty of information on other card games, but it does take time to edit it and produce it in electronic form.
</p><p>
Although I am not actively developing the sections on commercial, solitaire and invented games, I am happy to receive material about these, which will be placed in separate sections of the site.
</p><p>
The site does not carry detailed information on collectible card games (trading card games). This is not to suggest that there is anything wrong with these games - just that they are outside the scope of this site.
</p><p>
The site does not provide on-line games, nor does it generally carry computer software for downloading. I will however put in links to other sites which do carry on-line card games or downloadable card games software if people tell me about them.

</p><h2 id="contribute">How to contribute</h2>
<p>
<strong>I try to answer all reasonable e-mail, but please make sure you include a valid e-mail address for me to reply to. I have had several offers of help from people to whom I cannot respond, because the address in their e-mail does not work.</strong> In particular, if you send me mail from your WWW browser, for example using one of the mail links at the foot of pages on the site, please make sure you have configured your browser to show your correct e-mail address.
</p><p>
Here is how you can help me make this site even better.
</p><ol>
<li>Perhaps you were disappointed to find that your favourite card game is not described here. If you would like it to be included, why not write down the rules and send them to me. Please observe the following points about game descriptions:
<ul>
<li>They should be clear and complete, so that a group of players unfamiliar with the game can use the description to learn how to play;
</li><li>They should be originally written, not copied from a book (to avoid infringing copyright);
</li><li>They should preferably be submitted in plain text, which case I will convert to HTML;
</li><li>If you want to include diagrams or pictures, please e-mail me to discuss how;
</li><li>In any case it is a good idea to send me an e-mail before starting work, in case someone else has already written up the same game;
</li><li>As editor of the card-games site, I reserve the right to edit any contributions before publication, or subsequently.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Perhaps your favourite game is here, but I have got it wrong - or you know a better version of it - or you would like to add some extra information about it (such as advice on how to play well). Please let me know, so that I can put it right.
</li><li>Perhaps you tried to play one of the games described here, but found that the explanation was not clear, or the game failed to work in some way. Please tell me, so that I can improve the description.
</li><li>Perhaps you have found a mistake - however trivial - broken links, spelling mistakes or actual errors of fact. Please tell me so that I can put it right. (Don't assume that I or someone else will notice).
</li><li>Perhaps you own, or know of, another WWW site with related information. If there is not already a link to it from this site, please tell me about it so that I can put in a link.
</li><li>Perhaps you have some other ideas for improving this site. Other kinds of pages, other indexes. Whatever it is, please tell me.
</li></ol>
