    <p><b>Information we collect and how we 
    use it</b></p> 
    <p>In order to provide our full range of 
    services, we may collect the following types of information:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li><b>Information you provide </b>– 
      When you sign up for a PageLime Account or other PageLime service or promotion 
      that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such 
      as your name, email address and an account password). W also request 
      credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in 
      encrypted form on secure servers. </li> 
      <li><b>Cookies </b>– When you 
      visit PageLime, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing 
      a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely 
      identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our 
      service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results 
      and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search.</li> 
      <li><b>Log information </b>– 
      When you access PageLime services, our servers automatically record 
      information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server 
      logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol 
      address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request 
      and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li> 
      <li><b>User communications </b>– 
      When you send email or other communications to PageLime, we may retain 
      those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to 
      your requests and improve our services.</li> 
      <li><b>Affiliated 
      PageLime Services on other sites </b>– We offer some of our services 
      on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide 
      to those sites may be sent to PageLime in order to deliver the service. 
      We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated 
      sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy 
      practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</li> 
      <li><b>Gadgets </b>– PageLime 
      may make available third party applications through its services. The 
      information collected by PageLime when you enable a gadget or other 
      application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected 
      by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies.</li> 
      <li><b>Links </b>– PageLime may 
      present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these 
      links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality 
      of our technology, customized content and advertising. </li> 
      <li><b>Other sites </b>– This 
      Privacy Policy applies to PageLime services only. We do not exercise 
      control over the sites displayed within PageLime. These other sites 
      may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect 
      data or solicit personal information from you.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>PageLime only processes personal information 
    for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary 
    privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such 
    purposes include:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Providing our services, including 
      the display of customized content and advertising;</li> 
      <li>Auditing, research and analysis 
      in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li> 
      <li>Ensuring the technical functioning 
      of our network;</li> 
      <li>Protecting the rights or property 
      of PageLime or our users; and</li> 
      <li>Developing new services.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>PageLime processes personal information 
    on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. 
    In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your 
    own country. We may process personal information to provide our own 
    services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf 
    of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising 
    partners.</p> 
    <p><b>Choices for personal information</b></p> 
    <p>When you sign up for a particular service 
    that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. 
    If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for 
    which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such 
    use.</p> 
    <p>If we propose to use personal information 
    for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or 
    in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective 
    way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. 
    We will not collect or use sensitive 
    information for purposes other 
    than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary 
    service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p> 
    <p>Most browsers are initially set up to 
    accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies 
    or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some PageLime features 
    and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p> 
    <p>You can decline to submit personal information 
    to any of our services, in which case PageLime may not be able to provide 
    those services to you.</p> 
    <p><b>Information sharing</b></p> 
    <p>PageLime only shares personal information 
    with other companies or individuals outside of PageLime in the following 
    limited circumstances:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>We have your consent. We require 
      opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li> 
      <li>We provide such information 
      to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses 
      or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our 
      behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information 
      based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy 
      and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li> 
      <li>We have a good faith belief 
      that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is 
      reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, 
      legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable 
      Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, 
      (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical 
      issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety 
      of PageLime, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>If PageLime becomes involved in a merger, 
    acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will 
    ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such 
    transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred 
    and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p> 
    <p>We may share with third parties certain 
    pieces of aggregated, non-personal 
    information, such as the number 
    of users who use our services, for example, or how many sites are registered. 
    Such information does not identify you individually.</p> 
    <p>Please contact us at the address below 
    for any additional questions about the management or use of personal 
    data.</p> 
    <p><b>Information security</b></p> 
    <p>We take appropriate security measures 
    to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, 
    disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of 
    our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, 
    as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized 
    access to systems where we store personal data.</p> 
    <p>We restrict access to personal information 
    to PageLime employees, contractors and agents who need to know that 
    information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These 
    individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject 
    to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they 
    fail to meet these obligations.</p> 
    <p><b>Data integrity</b></p> 
    <p>PageLime processes personal information 
    only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with 
    this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. 
    We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure 
    that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed 
    to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this 
    Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information 
    we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our 
    users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p> 
    <p><b>Accessing and updating personal information</b></p> 
    <p>When you use PageLime services, we make 
    good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information 
    and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such 
    data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained 
    by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users 
    to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, 
    corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline 
    to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, 
    require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of 
    others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning 
    information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise 
    required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, 
    we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require 
    a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures 
    to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. We provide 
    the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or 
    FAQs for these services.</p> 
    <p><b>Enforcement</b></p> 
    <p>PageLime regularly reviews its compliance 
    with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or 
    concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or PageLime’s treatment of 
    personal information by <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">contacting

    at this address, it is PageLime’s policy to contact the complaining 
    user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate 
    regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, 
    to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that 
    cannot be resolved between PageLime and an individual.</p> 
    <p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p> 
    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy 
    may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this 
    Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such 
    changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes 
    on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a 
    more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification 
    of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will 
    be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will 
    also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your
