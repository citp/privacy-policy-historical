The Web Design Resource has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: PageResource.Com. 

Be sure to view our **[Children's Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130402163028id_/http%3A//www.pageresource.com/privacych.html)**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. 

This site contains links to other sites. **PageResource.Com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Our site uses a [contact form](http://www.pageresource.com/contact.htm) for customers to request information, return links, and services. In these forms, we collect visitor's contact information (like name, email address, and site addresses). The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. If a visitor submits a web site for a link review, the site address, title, and description provided may be posted on the appropriate pages. A visitor's e-mail address is not shared with or sold to any third parties. If you do not want us to know any of the information above, do not submit either form to us. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Our occasional online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We do not share a visitor's individual information.

The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx>.
