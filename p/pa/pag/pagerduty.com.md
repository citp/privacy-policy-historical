    2. _Law Enforcement._  
It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for PagerDuty to disclose your PII. We may also disclose your PII if we determine disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.

We may also be required to disclose such PII in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

**We are committed to protecting the security of information received via the Online Services, including PII.

Please do not disclose your account password to anyone else. Despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% risk-free, and PagerDuty does not warrant or guarantee that your PII will be secure in all circumstances.

##### **_Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement_**

**Scope:** This Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement is relevant to any individual located in the European Economic Area who uses or visits PagerDuty’s Online Services where these services directly link to this Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement. 

This Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement does not cover any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, through other PagerDuty websites or online services that do not display a direct link to this Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement, or through third-party websites.

_Effective:_ May 25, 2018

European Union Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“ **EU GDPR** “), requires PagerDuty to provide additional and different information about its data processing practices to data subjects in the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** “). If you are accessing the Online Services from a member state of the EEA, this Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement applies to you.

PagerDuty, Inc., 600 Townsend St., #200, San Francisco, CA 94103, is the data controller. Its representative in the EU is PagerDuty Ltd. and can be contacted at [privacy@pagerduty.com](mailto:privacy@pagerduty.com).

**Legal Basis of Processing.** In general, the legal basis for PagerDuty’s processing of your personal data in connection with the Online Services is Article 6(1)(b) of the EU GDPR, which allows processing of personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access, use or register for our Online Services, you form a contract with us based on the applicable terms of use or terms of service, and PagerDuty needs to process your personal data to provide the requested Online Services.

As exceptions, PagerDuty relies on your consent with respect to cookies that are not strictly necessary and direct marketing emails per Article 6(1)(a) of the EU GDPR; and pursues legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the EU GDPR with respect to situations where PagerDuty needs to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws (as a U.S.-based company, PagerDuty is subject to U.S. laws and must comply with them) or processes your personal data to improve our business and Online Services.

**Personal Data Transfers outside of the EEA.** PagerDuty may transmit some of your personal data to a country where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction, including the United States. As required by applicable law, PagerDuty, Inc. will provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data using various means, including, where appropriate:

  1.     1.       1.         * relying on a formal decision by the European Commission that a certain country ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data (a full list of such decisions may be accessed online here: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm>);
        * entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on language approved by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EC and/or 2004/915/EC), which are available upon request at privacy@pagerduty.com;
        * implementing appropriate physical, technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing; and
        * taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection in accordance with applicable law.



Any onward transfer is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.

**Data Retention.** PagerDuty keeps personal data as long as required to provide the Online Services you have requested or registered for and comply with applicable laws.

**Data Subject Rights.** You have a right to request from PagerDuty access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data or restriction of processing concerning you, as well as the right to data portability under the EU GDPR. You also have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal data. In general, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. You can exercise such rights by accessing the information in your account,  submitting a request [here](https://tickets.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and/or by emailing [privacy@pagerduty.com](mailto:privacy@pagerduty.com).

If you have provided consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary, direct marketing emails or other data processing based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

**Your Choices.** You are not required to provide any personal data to PagerDuty but if you do not provide any personal data to PagerDuty, you cannot use the Online Services. You can use the Online Services without consenting to cookies that are not strictly necessary or direct marketing emails; the only consequence is that our Online Services will be less tailored to you or you will not receive our marketing emails. Cookie preferences can be changed by clicking [here](https://www.pagerduty.com/pdsettings/cookies).

**Profiling.** PagerDuty does not use in connection with the Online Services automated decision-making, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or which significantly affects you.
