Last changed: June 7, 2018

Thanks for using FlippingBook or visiting one of our websites. This policy explains the what, how, and why of the information we collect when you visit one of our websites, or when you use our Services. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information.

The “ **Websites** ” include the Websites themselves, and any web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network “ **tabs** ,” or other online, mobile, or wireless offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device, or other technology, manner or means.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy often to stay informed of changes that may affect you, as your continued use of the Websites signifies your continuing consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Our electronically or otherwise properly stored copies of this Privacy Policy are each deemed to be the true, complete, valid, authentic, and enforceable copy of the version of this Privacy Policy which was in effect on each respective date you visited the Website.

## **YOUR INFORMATION**

## 5\. Information We Collect

**a) Information you voluntarily provide to  us:** When you sign up for and use the **Services** , consult with our customer service team, sales team, send us an email, send us a message in chat, post on our blog, integrate the Services with another website or service, or communicate with us in any way, you are voluntarily giving us information that we collect. That information may include either your or your client’s name, physical address, email address, IP address, phone number, credit card information, as well as details including gender, occupation, location, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, disclosed and stored by us, as described in our [Terms of Use](https://flippingbook.com/help/legal/flippingbook-online-terms-of-service) **,[EULA](https://flippingbook.com/help/legal/flippingbook-publisher-end-user-license-agreement)** and in this **Privacy Policy**.

**b) Information we  collect automatically:** When you use the Services or browse one of our Websites, we may collect information about your visit to our Websites, your usage of the Services, and your web browsing. That information may include your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, your browsing activity, and other information about how you interacted with our Websites or other websites. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

**c) Information from your use of  the Service:** We may receive information about how and when you use the Services, store it in log files or other types of files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information may include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you have taken within the application. This type of information helps us to improve our Services for both you and for all of our users.

**e) Cookies and tracking:** Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, FlippingBook) are called “first-party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third-party cookies”. Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The third parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as “performance” or “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide. We also enable our users to employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in connection with their use of our Services in order to allow us and our users to track their viewers. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below:

**Essential Website Cookies:** These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading “You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies:” below.

**Performance and Functionality Cookies:** These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our websites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.

**Analytics and Customization Cookies:** These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our websites and application for you in order to enhance your experience.

**Advertising (Targeting) Cookies:** These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

**Other tracking technologies:** We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair the functioning of these technologies.

**Targeted online advertising:** We have engaged one or more third-party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites. We also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to manage and serve to advertise on other sites.

These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (“Interest-Based Advertising”). For more information about this practice, click here: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads). The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).

If a user elects to use certain FlippingBook features, the use of those may permit or require additional cookies or tracking technologies to be employed. If a user connects his or her website (in each case, a “Site”) to a FlippingBook account, FlippingBook adds cookies and tracking technologies on that user’s Site. This will help to facilitate the use of certain automation, features, and functionality offered by FlippingBook through the Services. The specific cookies, pixels, or other technologies that will be set on a user’s Site depend on the particular features that the user chooses to use as part of the Services. Viewers should, therefore, review the relevant user’s privacy notice and cookie disclosures for further information about the specific types of cookies and other tracking technologies used on the Site.

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies:

**Browser Controls:** You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites through your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.

**Disabling Most Interest-Based Advertising:** Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest-Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

**Mobile Advertising:** You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of Interest-Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions. If you opt out, we will remove all data about you and no further data collection or tracking will occur. The random ID we (or our third-party partners) had previously assigned to you will also be removed. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will not be able to continue and track you using the same ID as before, and you will for all practical purposes be a new user to our system.

**Do  Not Track:** Some Internet browsers — like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. FlippingBook takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit [All About Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at [privacy@flippingbook.com](mailto:privacy@flippingbook.com)

**f)** **Web beacons:** We use web beacons on our Websites and in our emails. When we send emails to Users, we may track behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the performance of our email campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of Users. To do this, we include single-pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create reports about how our email campaign performed and what actions have you taken.

**g)** **Information from other sources:** From time to time we may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers and our joint marketing partners. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or required to disclose such information to us. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include demographic information, device information (such as IP addresses), location, and online behavioral data (such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links). We use this information, alone or in combination with other information (including Personal Information) we collect, to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products features, and services.

## 6\. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

If you use any of our Services and we think you might benefit from using another Service we offer, we may send you an email about that.

## 17\. Accuracy and Retention of Data

We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Agreements.

## 18\. Access

We will give an individual access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete information we hold about them by [contacting us here](https://flippingbook.com/contacts?subject=Request%20to%20a%20legal%20department). Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual from our servers at your request. There is no charge for an individual to access or update their Personal Information.

## 19\. Do Not Track Disclosure

“Do Not Track” is a standard that is currently under development. Because it is not yet finalized, FlippingBook adheres to the standards in this policy and does not monitor or follow any Do Not Track browser requests. That said, some of our features may have the ability to monitor or follow Do Not Track browser requests.
