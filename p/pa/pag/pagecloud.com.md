Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you may refuse or withdraw your consent to certain of the identified purposes at any time by contacting PageCloud’s Chief Privacy Officer using the contact information provided below. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you or continue to provide you with certain services or information which may be of value to you.

What Personal Information do we collect?

Canadian privacy legislation defines "Personal Information" broadly as information about an identifiable individual or as information that allows an individual to be identified. For the purposes of this policy, “Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual as defined from time to time in applicable privacy legislation. Generally speaking, “Personal Information” does not include what is considered business contact information: your name, title or position, business address, telephone number, facsimile number, or e-mail address. The types of Personal Information that PageCloud may collect about you includes your name, home address, telephone number, personal email address, billing and account information and other information incidental to providing our services. 

Why do we collect your Personal Information?

In general, PageCloud collects, uses and discloses Personal Information about our clients and service providers in connection with certain services we make available to you. More specifically, we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information for the following purposes: 

  * to establish and manage customer relationships and provide notifications to you. This may include the sharing of Personal Information by and between PageCloud personnel and affiliated companies and partnerships for such purposes;
  * to share Personal Information to and from third parties for the purpose of providing information about products and services. Such third parties may include other vendors of services and products.

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies the visitor's browser, but not necessarily the visitor, to our computers each time our website is visited. Unless a visitor specifically informs us (e.g. by registering for an event or sending us correspondence from the website), we will not know who the individual visitors are. In addition to the identified purposes described in our Privacy Policy, we may use this website information and share it with other organizations with whom we have a commercial relationship to measure the use of our website, to improve the functionality and content of the website and to facilitate usage by a visitor. Visitors can reset their browsers either to notify them when they have received a cookie or refuse to accept cookies. However, if a visitor refuses to accept cookies, he or she may not be able to use some of the features available on our website.

Online Communications – In order to provide our website visitors with a service or information, visitors may voluntarily submit Personal Information to us for purposes such as asking a question, obtaining information, reviewing or downloading a publication, participating in a seminar or other event, and participating in contests and surveys. If you are known to PageCloud as a registered user of an online service, we may combine and store Personal Information about your use of our website and the online information you have provided with certain other online and offline information we may have collected.

We will include instructions on how to unsubscribe and inform us of preferences if you decide you do not want to receive any future marketing or promotional e-mails from PageCloud.

Links \- Our website may contain links to other websites which are provided as a convenience only. Visitors are advised that other third party websites may have different privacy policies and practices than PageCloud, and PageCloud has no responsibility for such third party websites.

Changes to the Privacy Policy

PageCloud reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy, we will post such changes on our website and make such revised policy and changes available upon request to the PageCloud Chief Privacy Officer.
