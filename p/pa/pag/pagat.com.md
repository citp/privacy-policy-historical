# Card Games: Policy

By publishing rules of games, I am not suggesting that there is a single "correct" way to play each game. Most card games have a large number of minor variations and house rules - to play successfully, it is only necessary that the players should all agree on the rules at the start of a session. Where possible, I try to make sure that the rules given here are "authentic" - the aim is that they should correspond to the way regular players of the game actually play it. If there are significant variations, I try to include these as options. For games with official organisations and rules, official rules may be given, but unofficial alternative versions may also be included. 

The main focus is on publishing rules of traditional card games for two or more players. I use the term traditional card games to distinguish them from 

For traditional multi-player card games, I estimate that the site so far covers at most 30% to 50% of the card games that exist, depending on how you count variations, so there is plenty more work to be done, and all help is gratefully received. Originally I intended to focus on games which were hard to find elsewhere - for example in the widely available books about card games - but there turned out also to be a demand for pages on well-known games such as Bridge, Poker and Canasta, so these have been included as well. The mix of material which is now on the site has been influenced by the contributions people have offered me, by the questions I have been asked, and by my own personal tastes. There is plenty of information on other card games, but it does take time to edit it and produce it in electronic form. 

Although I am not actively developing the sections on commercial, solitaire and invented games, I am happy to receive material about these, which will be placed in separate sections of the site. 

The site does not carry detailed information on collectible card games (trading card games). This is not to suggest that there is anything wrong with these games - just that they are outside the scope of this site. 

The site does not provide on-line games, nor does it generally carry computer software for downloading. I will however put in links to other sites which do carry on-line card games or downloadable card games software if people tell me about them. 

**I try to answer all reasonable e-mail, but please make sure you include a valid e-mail address for me to reply to. I have had several offers of help from people to whom I cannot respond, because the address in their e-mail does not work.** In particular, if you send me mail from your WWW browser, for example using one of the mail links at the foot of pages on the site, please make sure you have configured your browser to show your correct e-mail address. 

Here is how you can help me make this site even better.

I would also like to thank two people who have allowed me to use their hand-drawn images of playing cards to illustrate the site. They are Oliver Xymoron, who drew the international pattern cards, and Sefa Costa, who drew the Spanish cards. 

Thanks also to the many others who have helped by supplying information, pointing out errors and omissions, providing links, etc. 

Here is a collection of buttons, representing awards the site has received over the years, and various affiliations.
