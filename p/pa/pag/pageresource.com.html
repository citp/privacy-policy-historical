<h1>Privacy Statement for PageResource.Com</h1>
</div>

The Web Design Resource has created this privacy statement in order to 
 demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our 
 information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: PageResource.Com.
<p>
Be sure to view our <strong><a href="privacych.html">Children's Privacy Policy</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, 
and to administer our Web site.  Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.
</p>
<p>
This site contains links to other sites.  <strong>PageResource.Com</strong> is not responsible
 for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
</p>
<p>
Our site uses a <a href="http://www.pageresource.com/contact.htm">contact form</a> and a 
 <a href="/zdir/addurl.htm">site submission form</a> for customers to request information,
  return links, and services. In these forms, we collect visitor's contact information (like name,
  email address, and site addresses). The customer's contact information is used to get in touch 
  with the visitor when necessary. If a visitor submits a web site for a link review, the 
  site address, title, and description provided may be posted on the appropriate pages. A visitor's 
  e-mail address is not shared with or sold to any third parties.  If you do not want us to know 
  any of the information above, do not submit either form to us. Users may opt-out of receiving 
  future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Our site also allows you to sign up for a free newsletter. In these forms, we collect visitor's contact information 
 (like their email address). At this time, the list is serverd through <A HREF="http://www.listbot.com">ListBot</A>.
 Your e-mail address is not shared with or sold to any third parties. Only our staff and ListBot have access to 
 the e-mail addresses.

<p>
Our occasional online surveys ask visitors for demographic information
 (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at 
 our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content 
 that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their 
 preferences.  This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 
 We do not share a visitor's individual information.
</p>
<p>
We use outside ad companies to display ads on our site.  Ads may contain cookies, and appear to
 be coming from our site, but in reality they are coming from our partners who are serving ads 
 on our site. Our site does not use cookies, except in the discussion forums or in tutorials that
 relate to the use of cookies.  We do not have access to any information about you from cookies 
 you might receive while visiting our site. Some customer data is shared with the advertising
