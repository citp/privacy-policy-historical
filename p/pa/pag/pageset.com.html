<h2>Pageset Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><em>Effective date: November 22, 2011</em><br>
    <br>
</p>
   Pageset is a service owned and operated by IAC Search &amp; Media, Inc. that allows users to easily select and change their browser start page. Once you have selected your home page, Pageset will display a search bar at the top of the web pages you visit.  By using Pageset, you are agreeing to the collection and use of certain information about you in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Pageset does not collect any information about the web sites or web pages you visit or about the web services that you use.  Pageset only collects information about your use of the Pageset service and search bar.</strong>  <br>
<br>
  We update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the ways we may collect, use, or share information, we will notify you by posting notice of the changes on the Site. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to become and remain familiar with it. The Privacy Policy includes at the top of the first page the date of the most recent change. <br>
<br>

  <br>
  <a href="#2">How may we use the information we collect?</a><br>

<h3>What types of information do we collect?</h3>
<br>
<p>When you use Pageset, we collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>
<li>the address of the last URL you visited before clicking through to pageset.com;</li>
<li>your browser and platform type;</li>
<li>your browser language; </li>
<li>the data in any undeleted "cookies" that your browser previously accepted from us (see "<a href="#3">How are cookies used?</a>" below) ; and</li>
<li>when you enter a search query using Pageset, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a search results page to you.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>We disassociate your query text data from your IP address and your unique cookie ID (see "<a href="#3">How are cookies used?</a>" below) after a period of 18 months, except in limited circumstances, such as requests to retain the information by law enforcement.
<br>
</p><p>Pageset does not require registration or submission of an account name or email address in order to use it. However, you would provide to us your email address if you submitted a help request to us via email. The amount of information that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you. We will not share your email address or any personally identifiable information you share with us with any third party.</p>
<br>
<a name="2" id="2"></a>
<h3>How may we use the information we collect?</h3>
<br>
<p>We use the information that we collect to improve the overall quality of your experience with Pageset, and to facilitate evaluation, improvement, and development of Pageset. We aggregate query information for internal reporting purposes and optimization of advertising revenue. We count, track, and aggregate our visitors' activities in our analysis of general traffic flows (e.g., tracking where users come from, what home pages they select, search results they select when using the Pageset search functionality, how they interact with search results, etc.). </p>
<br>
<p>Information about the search queries you submit and how you interact with search results may also be used to personalize the content and advertisements that we present to you. We may, based on the home pages you select, search queries you submit and the search results you select (including paid search results), draw inferences about your interests and display advertisements matched to such interests. You may receive such customized ads on the Pageset site and on third-party sites (see also   "<a href="#4">What information do we share with third parties?</a>" below). If you would like to terminate our access to your search history you may remove our cookies from your computer (see "<a href="#3">How are cookies used on the Sites?</a>" below and consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies).</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="3" id="3"></a>
<h3>How are cookies used?</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Our use of cookies.</strong> We use cookies and other technology such as pixel tags to track traffic flow and patterns of use of the Pageset services. Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allows us to store and retrieve information on a user's system. Our web server automatically asks a new user's browser whether it will accept our cookie file. If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our web server will record the cookie's unique ID for our use in internal reporting and for customized advertising (see "<a href="#2">How do we use the information that we collect?</a>" above). All of your search queries and interactions with our search results are associated with your unique cookie ID. When you use Pageset we may use your cookie data to customize Pageset and advertisements delivered to you (see "<a href="#4">What information do we share with third parties?</a>" below). </p>
<br>
<p>Our cookies expire after two years, and all information from expired cookies is automatically deleted from our servers. If you would like to remove our cookies from your computer, you can delete them using your browser (consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies). If you choose to decline or remove cookies, please note that this may affect the quality of Pageset.</p>
<br>
<p>We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way, or associate your name, email address, or personal information with your cookie data. We do not disclose cookie information to third parties, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (see "<a href="#4">What information do we share with third parties?</a>" below). </p>
<br>
<p><strong>Use of cookies on our Site by third parties</strong>. We use third-party companies to serve advertisements when you use Pageset. These companies may use information about your use of Pageset in order to present advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection with Pageset.com site pages. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad-serving company might collect from you. These companies have their own recordkeeping and data-retention policies. If you would like to consider your options for limiting use of such information by advertising companies, or would like to learn more about this practice, please click here:<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>. We also use third party vendors to help us better understand our user demographics.  These vendors may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection with the Site to provide their services to us. <br>
  <br>

</p>
<h3>What information may we share with third parties?</h3>
<br>
<p>We do not share your name name, or email address or any other personal information with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to send you information about their products or services (or for any other purpose, except to respond to <a href="#lawenforcement">legal process</a> as described below). </p>
<br>
<p><em>Third-party service providers</em>. Some elements or features of Pageset, such as the sponsored results advertising on our search-results pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract. We may supply some of the information we collect from you to those third parties so that they can provide those elements or features.  For example, when you submit a query, we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our paid-listing providers in order to generate relevant advertising to display in response to your query and to optimize the number and quality of sponsored results that will be provided to you on our search results page. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><a name="lawenforcement" id="lawenforcement"></a></p>
<p><em>Law enforcement/legal requirements</em>. We may disclose any information you voluntarily submit to us, as well as any other information we have about you in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, or regulatory obligations, or when otherwise required to do so by law. We also may disclose such information in compliance with a law-enforcement or other governmental request, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our<a href="/en/docs/about/terms_of_service.shtml">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Corporate restructuringi</i>. We also may transfer your information to a third   party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring   (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).</p>

</p>
<h3>What happens when you leave Pageset web pages to go to other Internet sites?</h3>
<br>
<p>We do not control the information collection and dissemination policies of third-party companies, including the company that operates the home page you have selected. In addition, if you click on a search result, the click may take you to a third-party website. These other sites may independently collect data from or about you, solicit information from you, or place their own cookies on your computer. We are not responsible for any use of the information such third-party site may collect.  </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Are there special considerations if you are visiting the Site from outside   of the United States?</h3>
<br>
<p>If you are using Pageset from outside of the United States, your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data-protection and other laws in the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your own country. Please be assured, however, that we seek to take reasonable steps to protect your privacy. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities and those third parties with whom we may share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
