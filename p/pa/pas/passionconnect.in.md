## How we use information we collect

### Collection of Your Personal Information

We collect information as part of operating our Websites and services.

At Passionconnect , we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.

In order to access some services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Passionconnect account. 

We collect additional information about your interaction with our sites and services without identifying you as an individual. For example, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. We also might use Web site analytics tools on our sites to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height.

When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Passionconnect , we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Passionconnect, information collected through one Passionconnect service may be combined with information obtained through other Passionconnect services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.

### Use of Your Personal Information

Passionconnect collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services. These uses include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Passionconnect services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. Additionally, with your permission, we may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Passionconnect and its affiliates, and/or share your personal information with Passionconnect partners so they may send you information about their products and services. You can opt-out from receiving newsletters or promotional e-mail anytime by using this web form or by following the steps as described in the respective newsletter or promotional e-mail.

Personal information collected on Passionconnect sites and services may be stored and processed in India or any other country in which Passionconnect or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. 

### Sharing of Your Personal Information

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Passionconnect and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some sites allow you to choose to share your personal information with select Passionconnect partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers. Other sites, See the Communication Preferences section below for more information.

Some Passionconnect services are co-branded by Passionconnect and another company (partner). If you register to or use such a service, both a Passionconnect privacy statement and the partner’s privacy statement may be displayed. If so, both Passionconnect and the partner will receive information you provide such as on registration forms.

Passionconnect occasionally hires other companies (vendor) to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose than for delivering the service to Passionconnect in accordance with Passionconnect’s instructions and policies. However, our vendors may use aggregate data for fraud detection to help improve their services. This helps them to more accurately detect fraudulent transactions. We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Passionconnect or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Passionconnect employees, customers or the public. We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

### Accessing and updating your personal information

Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

  * **For external processing**

We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

  * **For legal reasons**

We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Passionconnect if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

    * Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
    * Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
    * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
    * Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Passionconnect, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.



We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.

If Passionconnect is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
