## Your privacy

### Personal information submitted to the Department of Internal Affairs (the Department)

The Department collects personal information to assist with the provision of a variety of services (for example, in the provision of passports and birth certificates). You may browse and access information contained within this website without providing personal information, however, where you voluntarily provide personal information (e.g. through online forms) we will only keep and use that information for the purpose with which it was collected.

### Information matching and disclosure

The Department will not disclose personal information provided by you to any third parties, except with your consent, where such disclosure is required or permitted by the Privacy Act 1993 or otherwise required or permitted by law, or where such disclosure is one of the purposes in connection with which the information was obtained. Information provided by you may be used by other government agencies to allow more effective verification of information including your identity. This is important for maintaining the integrity of our services and to help in assessing your eligibility for various services. Information matching is carried out in accordance with Part 10 of the Privacy Act and is monitored by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
