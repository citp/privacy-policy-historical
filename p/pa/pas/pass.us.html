Files</span></b></p>

</div>

<p style=""><span style="
">One of the primary reasons people use PASS
is to share Files with others. Your personal information may be used to enable
you to communicate, collaborate and share Files. When you choose to collaborate
or share Files with others, PASS will collect the email addresses and
information of the other parties. Some information is retained only as long as
necessary to provide requested Services; other information may be retained
longer so we may provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations and
enforce our agreements. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with
Files you share on PASS (such as photos), please remove the metadata before
uploading the Files. </span></p>

<p style=""><span style="
">PASS is not responsible if you
volunteer personal information and Files online that are accessible to all or
some of the public. Any personal information you choose to provide should
reflect how much you want others to know about you. You may review, update,
correct or delete personal information or your account on your My Account page.
Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated. You may receive
unsolicited messages from other parties or your information and Files may be
used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety.
By submitting such information and Files, you assume the risks and sole
liability arising as a result of such information and Files being displayed.
You can control who has access to your Files, but you understand that any
shared Files may be re-shared or copied.</span> <span style="
">Although we allow you to limit access
to your Files, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or
impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share
your Files. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your Files.
We cannot ensure that Files you share on the Site or through the Services will
not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party
circumvention of any of our security measures. You can reduce these risks by
using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using
different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus
software.</span></p>

enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement
officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without
limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and
rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or
to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will
also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN's
rules, regulations and policies.</span></p>

<p style=""><span style="

information we collect about you with our service providers who perform
functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments,
sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, and providing marketing
assistance and customer service. These service providers are not authorized by
us to use or disclose personal information except as needed to perform their
functions or comply with legal requirements, and they may not use it for any
other purpose. Further, they must process the personal information in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. </span></p>

<p style=""><span style="

information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion
of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization,
