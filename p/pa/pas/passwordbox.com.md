### Thank you for choosing PasswordBox! 

This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") explains the privacy practices of PasswordBox, a product of PasswordBox Inc., a corporation (hereinafter "PasswordBox", "we", "us" or "our") that apply to (i) the access and use of the www.passwordbox.com website, and any related sub-domains, which are operated by PasswordBox (collectively the "Website"), (ii) download and use of our proprietary application (the "PasswordBox Application") and (iii) the provision by PasswordBox of services through the Website and the PasswordBox Application (the "Services").

PASSWORDBOX IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING YOUR PRIVACY. PLEASE READ THROUGH ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, HOW WE USE IT AND TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE IT. 

### PASSWORDBOX GUIDING PRINCIPLES.

The passwords you store in your PasswordBox are encrypted on your device using a master password that only you know. Your passwords will be encrypted on your device and will be sent to PasswordBox in encrypted form through a secure connection for storage in order to enable synchronization with your other devices. PasswordBox never stores your master password on any server so your passwords can't be retrieved by anyone but you. When you need to access your passwords the decryption of your passwords is done on your device with your master password. Your passwords can only be accessed by you with your master password unless you decide to share or bequeath passwords with another PasswordBox user. No PasswordBox employee can ever access your passwords. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO RECOVER YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU FORGET YOUR MASTER PASSWORD.

We don't ask for your personal information unless we truly need it. We don’t store your personal information on PasswordBox servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our Services. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles:

## 1\. CONSENT.

If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not provide us with any personal information or use any of the Services we offer on the Website or through the PasswordBox Application. You can withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions described below in the Section "QUESTIONS".

## 2\. AMENDMENTS AND NOTIFICATION OF PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES. 

We reserve the right to modify our Privacy Policy as necessary and will post a copy of the amended Privacy Policy on the Website. Please review it periodically to ensure that you are aware of any modifications. If we make any significant changes with regard to how we use your personal information, we will notify you in writing via the email address specified in your account or by posting a prominent notice on the Website.
