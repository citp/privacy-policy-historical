        <br>
  <u>Cookies</u>. A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser. Cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. We and our Partners use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie will terminate. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.<br>
  <br>
        We use cookies to: 1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers). We also use cookies to store your zip code and other information you have submitted for other services, such as displaying your local weather; 2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing our Services is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by registered users and unregistered users, and to help target advertisements based on user interests; 3) Allow our Partners to track visits to their sites and stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen; 4) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example which of our Sites you have visited.

We do not store Personally Identifiable Information in our cookies and we do not tie the information in our cookies to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the Partner Offers on our Services may also use cookies. We have no control over our partners’ privacy policies. We also have no control over their cookies, the information collected and its use.<br>
        <br>
  <u>Web Beacons or Pixels</u>. We and our Partners employ a software technology that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons or Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. They track your online Web movement. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, we embed Pixels invisibly on Web pages. They are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixels to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
        Some of the Partner Offers may also use Pixels. We have no control over our partners’ Pixels. We also have no control over how they use information collected.<br>

  <u>Global Unique Identifiers</u>. A GUID (global unique identifier) is a randomly generated alphanumeric identifier used to indicate a unique installation of our Products or Services. We may create a GUID when you install our Products or Services. We use GUIDs to track installations and to enable features and functionality for specific customers who subscribe to our Products and Services. We do not tie the information gathered by GUIDs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Software Information</u>. We employ a technology that allows us to determine the operating systems you are using and to view your computer’s registry. Software installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry, we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible versions of DirectX, and Flash Player installed. We use your registry information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with software already present on your PC. We do not tie registry information gathered to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Hardware Information</u>. Your computer’s operating system also stores hardware information that we examine to determine your computer’s hardware configuration including the amount of memory and the type of video card your computer has, as well as the speed of your processor. We use the information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with your computer hardware. We do not tie hardware information to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="UsesofInfo"></a><strong><u>How We Use Your Information</u></strong><br>
        Our primary goal is to make our Services more useful to you. By knowing about you, we are able to deliver relevant Services and Offers. We maintain a secure database of all Information collected on our Sites and Services.<br>
        <br>
  <u>Research</u>. We study users' demographics and interests using your information. We also use cookies, pixels, software information and server log files to better understand and serve you. We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We may also share this aggregated data with current and potential Partners.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Third Parties and Advertising</u>. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.<br>
        When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Site, you will be taken off of our Site and will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.<br>
        <br>
  <strong><u>Sharing Your Personal Information with Partners.</u></strong><br>
        The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:<br>
        <br>
  <u>Search Partners</u>. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Third-Party Advertisements and Software</u>. When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we may transfer your information for each request made to that Partner. If we transfer your Personally Identifiable Information, such information becomes subject to the Partners’ privacy policy.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Our Products</u>. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during the installation process. However, when you use any of our Partners’ Software Offers you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Other Limited Circumstances</u>. From time to time, we may validate the information in our database by employing a validation service.

  <br>
  <u>Legal Disclosure</u>: We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service, and improve our Products and Services.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="YourChoices"></a><u>Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer</u>. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions.

  <br>
  <strong><u>Your Choices</u></strong><br>
