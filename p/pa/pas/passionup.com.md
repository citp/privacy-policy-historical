We do not tie the information gathered by GUIDs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.

 _Software Information_

These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website <http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp>.

_Other Limited Circumstances_

. From time to time, we may validate the information in our database by employing a validation service. In those instances, we will disclose your information pursuant to confidentiality agreements.

 _Legal Disclosure_

: We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service, and improve our Products and Services.

 _Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer_

. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions.
