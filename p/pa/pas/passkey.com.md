Without your permission, Passkey will not sell or give the personal information you provide through the use of any Passkey product or service to any unaffiliated party other than those involved in providing the requested service, except when required by law or when data is requested by government or law enforcement authorities, or in the unlikely event of a sale of the business or transfer of assets.

This also includes personal data given to Passkey that you authorize for transfer to a third party website. You are strongly advised to read the data privacy policy of those companies before you provide or authorize Passkey to provide any personal information.
