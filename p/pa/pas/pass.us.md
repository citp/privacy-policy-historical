We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Site (“Files“). If you add a file to your account that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.

We cannot ensure that Files you share on the Site or through the Services will not become publicly available. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong PASS password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
