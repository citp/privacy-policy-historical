To create an account with the freeiPods.com, we collect your name, email address, and a shipping address. We use this information to set up your account, to send you a registration confirmation email and log your shipping information so we know where to send your order. We also give you a password that you may change in the Account page of our site. We will send you active emails thanking you for joining, sending a verification link, telling you an order has shipped, etc. We may also use your email address to send you information about new services, features, and special offers from us. Members may opt-out of receiving these types of future mailings by following instructions in the newsletter.

All email addresses for referrals, contest information and survey answers are securely protected. freeiPods.com operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

We may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from a freeiPods.com business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send offers to you.

Our goal is to deliver offers to people who we believe will find them of value. Offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information.
