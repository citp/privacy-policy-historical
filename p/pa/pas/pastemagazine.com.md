_How we use your personal information_

We collect personal information for the following reasons: 

**For the purpose of advertising** \- We rely on advertising revenue to support our journalism. We process your information to understand the effectiveness of the advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant personalised advertising. We use the information you give us and the information we collect about you to understand what advertisements you have been shown, or clicked on, to bill our advertising partners, and to present you with advertisements that are more relevant to you. 

If you decide to turn off personalised advertisements or advertisements tailored to you, you will still see the same number of advertisements but they may be less relevant to you. You may continue to see advertisements that are targeted to you based on other non-personal information, for example, the article that you are reading. 

More information about this practice and your choices about not having this information used by these companies is in the "How to manage cookies" section below. 

**To communicate with you via our newsletters** \- We want you to get the most out of our Sites. To do so we offer a Newsletter with carefully-curated articles and feature announcements. You are able to change your newsletter preferences through the footer of any of our emails. 

**To improve our Sites** \- we use cookies to understand how our customers use our Sites and interact with our communications and journalism. For example, we use technology on our Sites, which records user movements, which pages are most popular, and how navigation options are used. This helps us to identify usability issues and improve the assistance we can provide to users and is also used for aggregated and statistical reporting purposes. We also use cookies to understand what type of device you are using to show you the best version of the site. 

_Who we share your personal information with_

We disclose personal information to our advertising partners, through cookies to collect personal information and serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. 

We disclose your email address to a service provider we engage to manage our newsletter delivery. We do not rent or sell our email lists to anyone. 

We have contracts in place with all advertising partners and service providers. They can only use your personal information under our instruction.
