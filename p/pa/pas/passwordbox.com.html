	  <h1 class="section-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
	  <h3>Thank you for choosing PasswordBox! </h3>
<p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") explains the privacy practices of PasswordBox, a product of PasswordBox Inc., a corporation (hereinafter "PasswordBox", "we", "us" or "our") that apply to (i) the access and use of the www.passwordbox.com website, and any related sub-domains, which are operated by PasswordBox (collectively the "Website"), (ii) download and use of our proprietary application (the "PasswordBox Application") and (iii) the provision by PasswordBox of services through the Website and the PasswordBox Application (the "Services").</p>
<p>PASSWORDBOX IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING YOUR PRIVACY. PLEASE READ THROUGH ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, HOW WE USE IT AND TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE IT. </p>
<h3>PASSWORDBOX GUIDING PRINCIPLES.</h3>
<p>The passwords you store in your PasswordBox are encrypted on your device using a master password that only you know. Your passwords will be encrypted on your device and will be sent to PasswordBox in encrypted form through a secure connection for storage in order to enable synchronization with your other devices. PasswordBox never stores your master password on any server so your passwords can't be retrieved by anyone but you. When you need to access your passwords the decryption of your passwords is done on your device with your master password. Your passwords can only be accessed by you with your master password unless you decide to share or bequeath passwords with another PasswordBox user. No PasswordBox employee can ever access your passwords. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO RECOVER YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU FORGET YOUR MASTER PASSWORD.</p>
<p>We don't ask for your personal information unless we truly need it. We don’t store your personal information on PasswordBox servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our Services. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles:</p>
<h2>1. CONSENT.</h2>
<p>BY USING OUR WEBSITE OR THE PASSWORDBOX APPLICATION, OR BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, YOU CONSENT TO PASSWORDBOX'S COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY (AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME) AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not provide us with any personal information or use any of the Services we offer on the Website or through the PasswordBox Application. You can withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions described below in the Section "QUESTIONS".</p>
<h2>2. AMENDMENTS AND NOTIFICATION OF PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES. </h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify our Privacy Policy as necessary and will post a copy of the amended Privacy Policy on the Website. Please review it periodically to ensure that you are aware of any modifications. If we make any significant changes with regard to how we use your personal information, we will notify you in writing via the email address specified in your account or by posting a prominent notice on the Website. Any amendments to the Privacy Policy will be considered accepted by you if you continue to use the Website after any amendments have been posted on the Website. </p>
<h2>3. AN IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS.</h2>
<p>PasswordBox respects the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection (COPPA) Act of 1998 and upholds the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureau, Inc. in each of its websites for children. You can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this website or any other without your permission.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 18, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about anything you do not understand. Children under the age of 13 (U13) are prohibited from using the Services provided by PasswordBox.</p>
<h2>4. INFORMATION COLLECTION. </h2>
<p>PasswordBox only collects personal information provided to us via the Website or the PasswordBox Application during the completion of the registration form, during the use of our Services, during sign-up for our Services or while providing feedback or comments. Collection is limited to the following information: name and email address (i) that we receive from our social networking partners (e.g., such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+) if you have chosen to subscribe to the Services through those partners; and/or (ii) that you have decided to make available to us and your contacts (e.g., pictures, email) either directly or through our social networking partners. This information also helps us communicate with you about your use of the Service, product announcements and software updates, as well as to respond to your requests for assistance. From time to time, we may want to contact you with information about product announcements, software updates and special offers. We also may want to contact you with information about products and services from our business partners.</p>
<p id="4b">
  <strong>
    Opt-out:
  </strong>
  You may opt out of such communications at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link found within PasswordBox emails or by contacting
  <a href="https://customersupport.mcafee.com">https://customersupport.mcafee.com</a> directly.
</p>
<p>PasswordBox may also collect the following usage information, whether you are using the Website or using the PasswordBox Application as a registered or non-registered user: your IP address, PasswordBox cookie information (see below for more information), the date and time of your visit or use of the PasswordBox Application, the type of internet browser or hardware device (computer or mobile/smartphone) you are using, the URL of any other website that referred you to our Website or the PasswordBox Application, URLs of the pages you visit, your browsing history and your bookmarks in order to provide you with a better user experience. This information is not associated or linked to you as an individual and is not generally regarded as personal information unless you register for our Services. In the event of your registration, that information does become personal information as it is linked with the personal information contained in your account.</p>
<p>PasswordBox may also collect system information to diagnose and debug software issues. We collect a list of all add-ons or extensions that you have installed to Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari browsers in order to detect and solve add-on compatibility issues.</p>
<p>We organize usernames, URLs and encrypted passwords of users to allow them to synchronize this data across all their devices and also to share or bequeath passwords if they choose to do so. PasswordBox is not able to access the encrypted passwords because the encryption and the decryption of these passwords occurs on your device with a master password that only you know and PasswordBox never stores your master password on any server.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our service to share or bequeath passwords to a friend or to tell a friend (e.g. email a friend) about PasswordBox, we will request your friend’s email address and automatically send your friend an email inviting him/her to visit the site and create an account. PasswordBox stores this information for the sole purpose of sending those emails.</p>
<p>
  Your friend may contact us at any time via
  <a href="https://customersupport.mcafee.com">https://customersupport.mcafee.com</a>
  to request that we remove this information from our database. 
</p>
