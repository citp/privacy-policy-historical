# Privacy

Pacific Power sometimes partners with company affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties that provide services on the Company's behalf that are necessary to complete a customer-requested transaction. Under these limited circumstances, these third party relationships will be invisible to you as a customer. However, you have our assurance that your personal account information will be provided the same protections you experience directly with Pacific Power. The information shared is limited to that necessary to deliver the service authorized or requested by the customer and generally consists of name, account number, mailing address and phone number.

Pacific Power may disclose information to companies that perform marketing services on the Company's behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with Pacific Power and other legal restrictions that prohibit them from using the information except to market the specified Pacific Power-related products or services. The information shared is limited to information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as name, account number, mailing address and phone number.

There are times when Pacific Power is required to furnish information concerning present or former customers to regulatory agencies who audit the Company’s filings in rate cases, to government agencies or in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment or other comparable legal process; however, Pacific Power endeavors to cause the party receiving such information to agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information

Pacific Power does not disclose a customer’s personal information or energy usage data to any third party without your prior consent, except as necessary for Pacific Power to:

  * Provide services to you.
  * Operate and maintain Pacific Power’s electric system.
  * Comply with a valid warrant, subpoena, or court order.
  * Comply with a valid California Public Utilities Commission request or request from other state or federal governmental agencies with legal authority to obtain the data from Pacific Power.
  * Enable third parties to provide utility-related services on behalf of Pacific Power – but only to the extent necessary to render the service and subject to strict confidentiality and security requirements.
  * Assist emergency responders in situations of immediate threat to life or property.



Pacific Power may share non-customer specific energy usage data with other entities for the purpose of performing activities that may help improve such programs as energy efficiency and demand response, or to inform California energy policy as directed by the CPUC.

Lastly, you may request that we disclose your energy usage data, including your personal information, to third party companies or persons you designate and authorize to enable them to render certain services on your behalf. Before authorizing us to share this information, it is important that you (1) understand how those third parties or persons will to use your information and whether they intend to share it with others, and (2) know your rights as a consumer.
