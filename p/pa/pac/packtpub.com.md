**Use of Cookies**  
When you visit a Packt Publishing website, a cookie is often placed on your machine (if it is set up to accept cookies) or an existing cookie is read if you have visited the site previously. One use of cookies is to assist in the collection of the site visitation statistics described above. We also use cookies to collect information on which newsletter links are clicked by customers. This information is used to ensure we are sending information customers want to read. It is collected in aggregate form and never linked with your personal information. Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used to assist in delivering the cookie on our site. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a web page. We do not use this technology to access your personally identifiable information; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about Packt Publishing website usage. We may share aggregated site statistics with partner companies but do not allow other companies to place clear gifs on our sites.

**Sharing Your Personal Information**  
As a matter of principle we do not sell information we retain about you to any third parties. We do share limited information in the following limited and specific circumstances:

We use agents to perform certain operational functions such as warehousing, credit-card processing, shipment etc. We pass on to these partners only the information they need about you to perform the service required, and they are not allowed to use this information for any other purpose.

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Packt Publishing or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Packt Publishing and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Packt Publishing employees, customers, or members of the public.

**Control of your Personal Information  
** When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, Packt Publishing will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. At the time of registering for some services, you will be given the option to opt out of receiving email from Packt Publishing beyond the scope of the specific service in question.

At any time you can change your preferences for how or if we contact you, or change the information that we hold. For email registrations where you do not have a full account and password set up, subscription options can be changed and authenticated through email.

**Collection of your Personal Information**
