5.        What About Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?
When you interact with the Sites and Applications, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We
or our third party service providers use cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and similar
technologies to track user activity and collect website and application data. We may combine this data with the
personal information we have collected from you. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-
track” requests. . You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling
cookies), but such disabling will impair use of the Sites and Applications.
Cookies. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We
and our third party service providers may use “cookies” on our Sites and Applications to, among other things,
better serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites and
Applications. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies. In addition, we also allow


vendors to use cookies on our Sites and Applications.
    Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your
     computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our
     systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Sites and Applications.
     This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have
     logged in, as you move through our Sites and Applications.
    Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser
     or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information
     about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.
    Third Party Cookies. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and
     personally identifiable website data and to serve advertisements. To do so, we may permit third parties to
     apply cookies to users of our Sites and Applications, where permitted by law, and, subject to your right to
     opt-out through the Network Advertising Initiative and About Ads (as discussed below). We use the data
     collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Sites and Applications
     and to analyze site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with
     other information that they have collected. These third parties are required to use your information in
     accordance with this Policy.
Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your
browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a
new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Sites and Applications who disable their web
browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Sites and Applications; however, many site
features, such as the shopping cart, will not function if you disable cookies. For more information on our
cookies and opt-out features, please see our Cookies Statement.
Local Storage Objects. We and our third party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash
LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit or to display content based upon what
you view on our Site. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data
stored. In addition, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser.
For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the
Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see
the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the
instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies. We may use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web
bugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies. In contrast to
cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Sites and Applications to, among other things, track the
activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage. We and
our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-
mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed
and track whether our e-mails are forwarded. For more information on the types of such tracking
technologies we use, please see our Cookies Statement.
Site Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of
our Sites and Applications. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Sites and Applications . We
use these tools to help us improve our Sites and Applications, performance and user experiences. These
entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your
personal information with these third parties. For the privacy policies and mechanisms for opting out of
Google Analytics, please see https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Third-Party Ad Networks. We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on
our Sites and Applications. Please see the section entitled “Advertisements” for additional information about
our practices and your choices with regard to receiving such advertisements.
Advertisements
We display advertisements on our Sites and Applications. Some of the advertisements are based on the
collection of personal information and others are based on the collection of aggregate information. Please see
the bottom of this section for opt-out information.


We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Sites and Applications.
Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and
Applications and other websites and applications you have visited. This enables us and these third parti es to
target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad
network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript,
web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their
ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy,
not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Sites and
Applications and our Services, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information.
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. The website
http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp provides information regarding this practice by
Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information
used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI
members. You also may contact About Ads at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for information about opting
out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member
companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members. Opting out
of one or more NAI members or About Ad members (many of which will be the same) only means that those
members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive
any targeted content or ads on our Sites and Applications or other websites and applications. You may
continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if
your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt- out page, or you subsequently erase
your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or About Ad opt-out may no longer,
be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and About Ad’s websites and applications accessible
