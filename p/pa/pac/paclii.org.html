</p><p>PacLII's privacy policies are based on respect for international
standards of information privacy protection.


</p><h2><font color="#D79100">A. Information concerning usage of PacLII</font></h2>

<p><b>A1.</b> PacLII collects information which identifies, for each
page accessed on PacLII, the network identity of the machine which
has accessed it.  PacLII retains this usage information for purposes
of network analysis, usage analysis, and research into usage patterns
for the purpose of improving PacLII services. Access to and use of
this information is restricted to PacLII management and staff, and to
researchers working on PacLII projects and subject to an agreement to
adhere to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>A2.</b> PacLII does not disclose or publish information which
identifies individual machines, or potentially identifying
sub-groupings of addresses, without consent. PacLII does publish
aggregated information about usage patterns.</p>

<p><b>A3.</b> PacLII reserves the right to gather more extensive
information that stated above (i) about any attempted access to
PacLII which raise security issues (and, where necessary, to make
disclosures to relevant authorities); and (ii) for network analyses on
an occasional basis.</p>


<h2><font color="#D79100">B. Personal information contained in PacLII databases</font></h2>

<p><b>B1.</b> Some PacLII databases contain personal information,
including the decisions of Courts and Tribunals, and the reports of
Royal Commissions.  PacLII publishes these databases with the consent
of the public bodies concerned. It is the responsibility of the public
bodies which provide these databases to PacLII to determine, subject
to the requirements of the laws under which they operate, the
appropriate balance between the privacy interests of individuals and
the public interests in dissemination of the information. In
particular, if personal data is to be anonymised before publication,
this is done by the public body concerned. PacLII does not and can
not censor part or all of the information provided by these public
bodies for publication.</p>

<p><b>B2.</b> PacLII does not consent to the contents of these
databases being indexed by other web sites. PacLII attempts to
prevent such indexing occurring by placing these database outside the
permitted scope of web 'crawlers', 'robots' or 'spiders' that adhere
to the voluntary Robot Exclusion Standard</p>

<p>PacLII also monitors whether any robots attempt to index these
databases in disregard of this Standard, and takes steps to exclude
any that do so from any access to PacLII.</p>

<p><b>B3.</b> PacLII users should note that there are legal
limitations on the use, publication and dissemination of some personal
information contained in PacLII databases.
</p><p><strong>B4. </strong>If any person considers that any case in a PacLII database may contain information which it should not include, PacLII suggests that they should contact the Registrar of the Court or Tribunal concerned, setting out the reasons why there is information in a case which should not be published. The Court or Tribunal is then in a position to inform all previous recipients of the case of any matters that need to be changed. 
</p><p><b><font color="#295482">PacLII reserves the right to exclude access to its 
  databases by users or sites that are in apparent breach of any such legal requirements.</font></b></p>
