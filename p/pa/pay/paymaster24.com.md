We have described the purposes for which we may use information about you. We are

Protection Legislation, by relying on one or more of the following lawful grounds:
(a)      you have explicitly agreed to us processing such information for a specific
         reason;


(b)       the processing is necessary to perform the agreement we have with you or to
          take steps to enter into an agreement with you;
(c)       the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation we have; or
(d)       the processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by
          us, which might be:
                           (i)        to ensure that our Customer Accounts are well-
                                    managed;
                           (ii)       to provide our Service;
                           (iii)      to prevent fraud;
                           (iv)       to protect our business interests;
                           (v)        to ensure that complaints are investigated;

                                    products and services, unless you have indicated at
                                    any time that you do not wish us to do so.
In relation to any processing of special categories of personal data, we will generally rely
on obtaining specific consent in order to process such information, although it may be
necessary for us to use certain information in order to comply with our legal obligations
as a regulated entity (such as in relation to an alleged offence). Where you have
consented to our processing of such information (including special categories of personal
data) you may withdraw such consent at any time. Please note, however, that in certain
circumstances it may be still lawful for us to continue processing this information even
where consent has been withdrawn, if one of the other legal bases described above is
applicable.
Automated processing
When we use your information, we may use automated processes.
In particular, in order to comply with our obligations under anti-money laundering
legislation, we are required to verify the identity of all clients and other information
(including but not limited to details of any nationality, citizenship or rights of residence
you hold) to satisfy our regulatory obligations. We may do this using an electronic
verification system that we consider suitable or by asking you for documentary evidence.
If you want to know more about your rights in relation to automated decision making,
please contact us.

account holder) (a "Relevant Third Party"), by providing us with such information you
confirm that you are permitted to give us this information on their behalf.
Transferring Your Information Outside The UK
Our in data storage facilities are located within the European Union. However we do
store and process personal data outside the European Union and so information about
you in our possession may be transferred to other countries (which may include
countries outside the European Economic Area) for any of the purposes described in this
Privacy Policy, including our transmission of such information to our agents outside the
European Economic Area. If any such information (including special categories of
personal data) belongs to any Relevant Third Parties, by providing us with such
information you confirm that you have obtained any necessary permissions from such
persons to the reasonable use of their information for such purposes in accordance with

behalf.

potentially less stringent) laws relating to the degree of confidentiality afforded to the
information it holds and that such information can become subject to the laws and
disclosure requirements of such countries, including disclosure to governmental bodies,
regulatory agencies and private persons, as a result of applicable governmental or
regulatory inquiry, court order or other similar process. In addition, a number of
countries have agreements with other countries providing for exchange of information
for law enforcement, tax and other purposes.
When we, or our permitted third parties, transfer information outside the European
Economic Area, we or they will impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that
data to protect such information to the standard required in the European Economic
Area. We or they may require the recipient to subscribe to international frameworks
intended to enable secure data sharing.      In the case of transfers by us, we may also
transfer your information where:
(a)      the transfer is to a country deemed to provide adequate protection of your
         information by the European Commission; or
(b)      you have consented to the transfer.
If we transfer your information outside the European Economic Area in other
circumstances (for example because we have to provide such information by law), we
will use best endeavours to put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that your
information remains adequately protected.

         undertake automated decision-making, including profiling, and the logic,
