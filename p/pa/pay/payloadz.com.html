						<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						<div class="content-holder">
								 <p align="justify">
									This site is owned and operated by PayLoadz, Inc . We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
								</p>
								<p align="justify">
									Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should
						fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of
						that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather
						and how we use it.<br>						<br>
						INFORMATION PayLoadz, Inc GATHERS AND TRACKS<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc gathers two types of information about users:<br>· Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions.
						These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate
						in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in
						polls and surveys:<br>· Information PayLoadz, Inc gathers through aggregated tracking
						information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This
						information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help
						our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience.
						Because PayLoadz, Inc derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships
						and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping
						our service in operation. <br>						<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:<br>
						Optional Voluntary Information<br>
						We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission
						of personal information by users:<br>						<br>
						1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
						We will offer a electronic newsletter to users. PayLoadz, Inc gathers
						the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves
						from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that
						points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to
						the newsletters at the time of registration.<br>						<br>
						2. Message boards/forums<br>
						Users of the site ' s Message Boards and Forums must register separately for
						these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although
						they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required
						to supply a username, password, and email address.<br>						<br>
						3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
						Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents
						to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend";. The user must
						provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information
						is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient
						know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.<br>						
						<br>
						4. Polling<br>
						We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions
						with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions
						or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular
						user. PayLoadz, Inc may use a system to "tag" users after
						they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag
						is not correlated with information about individual users.<br><br>
						5. Surveys<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target
						our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information
						in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. <br>
						Children<br>
						Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
						(COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information
						from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.<br>
						Usage tracking<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our
						sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual
						users. PayLoadz, Inc does break down overall usage statistics according
						to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information
						from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that
						users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with
						individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our
						sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track
						what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This
						helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
						Cookies<br>
						We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of
						your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although
						it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have
						specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie
						can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off
						your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. PayLoadz, Inc uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising
						system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.<br>
						You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your
						browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message
						with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.
						However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums,
						polling and surveys.<br>						<br>
						USE OF INFORMATION<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc uses any information voluntarily given by our users
						to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive
						or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based
						on the interests of our users.<br>
						As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to
						send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,
						surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on
						a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special
						editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something
						we are doing. When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our
						sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track
						what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This
						helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered
						in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we
						don't track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc creates aggregate reports on user demographics and
						traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers
						to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements
						that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns
						of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific
						user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual
						user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect
						the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>						<br>
						SHARING OF THE INFORMATION<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc uses the above-described information to tailor our
						content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's
						demographics.<br>						<br>
						SECURITY<br>
						PayLoadz, Inc operates secure data networks protected by industry
						standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies
						are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals
						have access to the information provided by our customers.<br><br>
						OPT-OUT POLICY<br>
						We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:<br>
						· Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely
						alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our
						users <br><br>
						YOUR CONSENT  <br>
						By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information
						by PayLoadz, Inc. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will
						post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information
						we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. </p>
