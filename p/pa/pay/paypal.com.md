   **Information this Site Collects**

**Required Information**  
To open a PayPal account, consumers must submit their name, address, phone number, and email address. To take advantage of certain features of PayPal, consumers must submit credit card or bank account information. Required information is necessary for us to process transactions, protect you against credit card or bank account fraud and allows us to contact you should the need arise. 

**Transaction Information**  
To process transactions, we collect information related to each transaction, such as the amount and the necessary identifying information, including the account numbers or email addresses of the parties involved. 

**Third-Party Information**  
During the processing of transactions, we collect verification information from our credit card authorization service (CyberSource). CyberSource verifies that users' credit card information and address matches the information that the user supplies to PayPal. 

**Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data**  
We may offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in the survey itself. 

**Aggregate Statistical Information**  
We may collect aggregated statistical information for purposes of improving our service and your experience with PayPal. This data does not contain personally identifying information, such as name or email address.  


**Internal Uses**  
We use data collected on our website in order to 1) provide our financial services, 2) provide customer service, and 3) improve our product. We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests. 

**Contacting PayPal Visitors**  
We may contact website visitors about our products or conduct additional surveys. Only those visitors who have given their permission to participate may be contacted. 

**Disclosure to Other PayPal Users**  
We will NEVER release an individual's personal information without consent. If you are a registered PayPal user, you have consented to have your name, email address, date of sign-up, and whether you have confirmed (or not confirmed) an account at another financial institution only made available to anyone whom you have paid or who is attempting to pay you through PayPal, as described in the Terms of Use. However, your credit card number, bank account and routing number, and other financial information will NEVER be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has paid you through PayPal. This makes PayPal transactions more private than mailing a check or giving out your credit card! 

**Disclosure to Third Parties**  
We will not give third parties individually identifiable information about users except for the limited purposes described below.   


  1. In accordance with the Terms of Use of the PayPal service, whenever it is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal process, to protect our systems and customers, or to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems. 
  2. We are compelled to do so by order of a duly-empowered governmental authority. 
  3. We have the express permission of the consumer, such as provided in the Terms of Use. 
  4. We are required to disclose it in order to process transactions. 
  5. We may share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or the general public. For example, we may tell the general public that 10% of our users live in California. 
  6. When a user signs up for a co-branded version of PayPal (e.g. PayPal eGroups or PayPal eCircles) through links on our co-branded partner's website, PayPal will share with the co-branded partner that user's name, email address and physical address. When a user signs up for a co-branded version of PayPal through Intuit's QuickBooks software, PayPal will share with Intuit that user's transactional information in order to sync with QuickBooks. 



**Internet Information**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**Referral Program**  
When you sign up for a PayPal account, we send you an email with a unique referral link that you can forward to your friends. The link identifies you as the referrer. If a friend uses that link to sign up and completes the [bonus requirements](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/bonus-faq-outside), you are eligible for a referral bonus. Alternatively, if you are the first user to send money to a friend who is not a PayPal user, you are also eligible for a referral bonus. In order for you to receive your bonus, your friend must sign up for PayPal and earn the $5 bonus by completing the [new account bonus requirements](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/bonus-faq-outside). Please use our referral program responsibly. We strictly enforce our [Anti-Spam Policy](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/spam-outside)! Read details on the [Refer-A-Friend Bonus](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/referral-faq-outside). 

**Use of Cookies**  
We use cookies when users log in to their PayPal account with their email address and password. These cookies allow us to remember a user who visits multiple pages in our site, so that the user doesn't need to re-enter the password multiple times. Once the user shuts down the browser, these cookies expire and no longer have any effect. We also use longer-lasting cookies to display users' email addresses, so that they don't have to retype the email address each time when logging in to an account. In addition, we use cookies to process our affiliate program; no personal information is shared with our affiliates. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 

**Opting Out**  
At the end of the registration process, a new user may elect to be excluded from any surveys or product announcements. A user who later decides not to receive email notifications for PayPal transactions or product announcements may choose to opt out by changing their preferences in the Profile page of the My Account tab. 

**Corrections and Updates**  
Users can update their account information in the Profile page of the My Account tab. In some cases, it may be necessary to email [service@paypal.com](mailto:service@paypal.com) or call (402) 935-7733 Monday through Friday between the hours of 4am and 10pm PT. 

**Deactivation**  
Users may terminate an account by sending a request to our customer support staff through the Contact Us button on our website through our Help Center. 

**Notification of Changes**  
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the website. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check this site for information about revisions to our privacy policy.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can email [service@paypal.com](mailto:service@paypal.com) or call (402) 935-7733 Monday through Friday between the hours of 4am and 10pm PST.
