<h3>Updated May 18, 2010</h3>
<p>The following details our Privacy Policy (the “Policy’) at IZEA, Inc.  (“IZEA”) and describes the types of information we gather from those  persons visiting the Internet websites <a title="IZEA™ :: PayPerPost,  SocialSpark, Blogger's Choice Awards, RSSBrief, URLBrief" href="http://www.izea.com/" target="_blank">www.izea.com</a>, <a title="PayPerPost.com :: Get Paid for Blogging, Blog Advertising,  Advertise on Blogs" href="http://www.payperpost.com/" target="_blank">www.payperpost.com</a>,  <a title="Sign up for more information about SocialSpark" href="http://www.socialspark.com/" target="_blank">www.socialspark.com</a>,  <a href="http://www.sponsoredtweets.com/">www.sponsoredtweets.com</a>, <a title="best blogs |  Blogger's Choice Awards" href="http://www.bloggerschoiceawards.com/" target="_blank">www.bloggerschoiceawards.com</a>,  <a title="IZEARanks.com :: Top 100 Blogs, Blog Ranking, RealRank™" href="http://www.izearanks.com/" target="_blank">www.izearanks.com</a>,  <a title="DisclosurePolicy.org: Disclosure Policy, Disclosure Policy  Generator" href="http://www.disclosurepolicy.org/" target="_blank">www.disclosurepolicy.org</a> (the “Site(s)”) and how we use such information. This policy <strong>does not cover WeReward.com</strong>. We understand the  importance of privacy and accordingly, treat all information received in  a responsible manner. This Policy applies to all of the services  offered by IZEA (the “services”) on the Sites. By accessing the Sites,  you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the  terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites. Each time you  use the Sites, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply.  Accordingly, when you use the Sites, you should check the date of this  Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last  version.</p>
<h4>Use of Information Collected by Us</h4>
<p>IZEA may collect two types of information from users of our Sites:  “personal information” (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address,  phone number, etc.) and “aggregate information” (such as frequency of  visits to any of the Sites, search terms entered, Site pages most  frequently accessed, browser type, etc.)</p>
<p>We use this information in an effort to improve your experience on  the Sites and to communicate with you about information that you  request. We may also use this information to help us target specific  services or offers to you, to help us develop and improve our Sites, and  to tailor our Sites to your interests.</p>
<h4>Collecting and Using Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>IZEA only collects personal information that is voluntarily provided  when users sign up for an IZEA site. Specifically, when you sign up for  an marketplace (PayPerPost, SocialSpark and SponsoredTweets), we ask you  for personal information such as your name, address, email address, and  social security number. (Please note that we require social security  numbers for income tax reporting purposes.) We may also request PayPal  payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on  secure servers.</p>
<h4>Collecting and Using Your Aggregate Information</h4>
<p>IZEA also collects aggregate information, which is non-personally  identifiable information about you, such as frequency of visits to the  Sites, search terms entered, browser type, etc. Aggregate information is  used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by  that compiled information. IZEA uses aggregate information to provide  its services and remuneration, as well as to determine the use of our  Sites and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to our  business metrics.</p>
<h4>Contests/Sweepstakes</h4>
<p>From time-to-time, we may request information from users of our Sites  in connection with a contest or a sweepstakes. Participation in these  contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary and the user therefore  has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information  requested may include contact information and supplementary information  on your interests, opinions and preferences. We will use the contact  information to notify winners. We may publish winners’ first name, last  initial and city of residence on the Sites and in order to comply with  state law, we may be required to share: (i) winners’ first name, last  name and address with state agencies and (ii) winners’ first name and  last name with persons requesting such information via the mail.</p>
<p>Sharing, Selling and Trading of Your Personal Information Collected  Online with Third Parties IZEA does not share, rent, sell or disclose  personal information to third parties, except as described in this  Privacy Policy. IZEA shares personal information with our parents and  subsidiaries, and on occasion, we may share personal information with  third party service providers, such as credit card processing companies.  These third party service providers are not authorized to retain,  share, store or use your personal information for any purposes other  than to provide the services for which they have been hired to provide.  In addition, in order to protect against potential fraud, we may verify  with third parties the personal information you provide when you sign up  for a PayPerPost account. In the course of such verification, we may  receive personal information about you.</p>
<p>We do not sell, trade or otherwise share your personal information  with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<p>In following circumstances, IZEA may elect to share or transfer your  personal information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a  legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process  served on IZEA, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or  identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger,  reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of IZEA; (iv) when we believe  it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of IZEA or  other persons, or (v) as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>It should be noted that on some portions of the Sites, users can  choose to have their personal information displayed. If users choose to  have their personal information displayed on the Site(s), they will be  given forewarning that the action they are about to take will make their  personal information publicly available on the Site(s).</p>
<h4>Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online  with Third Parties</h4>
<p>We may share, sell or trade with third parties aggregated,  non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a  particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular  advertisement. As stated earlier, such information does not identify  you individually.</p>
<h4>Message Boards</h4>
<p>On some of the Sites, we provide message boards for visitors to post  comments and messages for others to read. We may collect technical  information about your post, such as the IP address from which you  posted, and associate this information with your messages. Even if  messages are deleted, we may retain copies and attendant information  indefinitely.</p>
<p>When you post messages to the message boards, certain information,  such as your email address, user name and/or full name, may be available  to the public. Also note that any personal information you include in  the body of your message will be available to the public so it is  important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when  deciding to reveal personal information in these areas.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information which websites transfer to your  computer’s web browser for storage on your computer’s hard drive. When  you visit the Sites, we may place one or more cookies on your computer  to uniquely identify your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality  of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends,  such as how people blog. We store minimal personal information in  cookies and protect this information. We do not store complete records  or credit card numbers in cookies. You may chose to set your computer to  not accept cookies, but some features and services on the Sites may not  function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<h4>Use of Pixel Tags/Clear GIFs/Web Beacons</h4>
<p>A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible  tag placed on certain pages of our Sites but not on your computer. When  you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that  visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a  particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies  the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.</p>
<h4>Security Pertaining to Your Information</h4>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized  access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of  data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and  processing practices and security measures, as well as physical  security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where  we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to IZEA employees, service  providers and agents who need to know that information in order to  operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by  confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including  termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these  obligations. We use secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology to encrypt  and protect the security of your personal information, including but not  limited to you credit card number, when it is sent over the Internet.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic  storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect  your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. IN  NO EVENT WILL IZEA OR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR ANY PARTY INVOLVED IN  CREATING, PRODUCING OR DELIVERING THE SITES BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER  WHATSOEVER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR  PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE  SITES, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OR PERFORMANCE, ERROR,  OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION,  COMPUTER VIRUS OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE (INCLUDING LOSS PROFITS, LOSS  OF BUSINESS OR DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM  INACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION OR INCONVENIENCE, DELAY, OR LOSS OF THE  USE OF THE SITES). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY WHETHER THE ALLEGED  LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY  OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF IZEA OR ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<h4>Integrity of Your Data</h4>
<p>IZEA processes personal information only for the purposes for which  it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We review our data  collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only  collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or  improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the  personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but  we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information  whenever necessary.</p>
<h4>Copyright Infringement/DMCA Notice</h4>
<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any  submission on the Sites’ message boards or any other content on the  Sites infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification  pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(3), the Digital  Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our designated copyright  agent with the following information in writing:</p>
<p>(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act  on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly  infringed;</p>
<p>(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been  infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are  covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works  at that site;</p>
<p>(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing  or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed  or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably  sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</p>
<p>(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider  to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if  available, an electronic mail;</p>
<p>(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the  material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright  owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
<p>(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is  accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act  on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly  infringed.</p>
<p>IZEA’s designated copyright agent to receive notifications of claimed  infringement is: D. Mackenzie, 150 N. Orange Avenue, Suite 412,  Orlando, Florida 32801 or <a href="mailto:copyrightagent@izea.com">copyrightagent@izea.com</a>.  Only DMCA notices should go to the designated copyright agent; any  other comments, requests, or other communications should be directed to <a href="mailto:info@izea.com">info@izea.com</a>. You acknowledge that if  you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your  DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
<h4>Children and Privacy</h4>
<p>Our Sites are not directed to children and we will not request  personally identifiable information from anyone who we know to be under  the age of 18, unless we have obtained verifiable parental consent from a  parent or legal guardian. If we become aware that a user under the age  of 13 has registered with any of our Sites, provided personally  identifiable information, and IZEA has not obtained prior verifiable  consent from a parent or legal guardian, we will immediately remove the  user’s personally identifiable information from our files.</p>
<h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
<p>The Sites may contain links to websites operated by other people or  companies. Those websites may have their own privacy policy or no  privacy policy at all. IZEA does not have any responsibility for those  websites, and we provide the links solely for the convenience of our  visitors.</p>
<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
<p>In the event that IZEA sells substantially all of its assets, or one  of IZEA’s business units are acquired, personally identifiable  information of visitors to the Sites and aggregate information will  likely be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<h4>Changes to this Policy</h4>
<p>Please note that we may change this Privacy Policy at any time and  without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Policy on  our Sites.</p>
<h4>Corrections/Information Removal/Opt-Out</h4>
<p>If your name, e-mail or postal address, telephone number or other  personal information changes, you may update, correct or omit the  relevant information by contacting us at IZEA Customer Service, 150 N.  Orange Avenue, Suite 412, Orlando, Florida 32801 or by visiting our site  and clicking Contact Support..
