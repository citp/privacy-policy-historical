# Privacy Policy

Here at PayScale, Inc. ("PayScale," "we," "our," or "us") we care about being transparent with our visitors and users. Effective as of May 25, 2018, we have updated our Privacy Policy to clarify (in plain English and with a lot of bullets) what information we collect and how we use that information when you visit our Websites (defined herein) and use our products or services (collectively, "Services"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Website" collectively refers to payscale.com and other websites that we operate or that link to this Privacy Policy. The previous version of this Privacy Policy can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/privacy-archive). 

We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, "Privacy Shield") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively. To learn about how we comply with the Privacy Shield principles, go [here](https://cdn-payscale.com/content/legal/privacyshield.pdf). You can learn more about Privacy Shield and view our certification [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). 

## Why and how do we collect information?

Our main purpose for collecting data is to provide you the Website, Services, and features that best meet your compensation information and management needs. We collect information through various ways. Below are the most common circumstances of how we collect information: 

  * **Signing up for a PayScale account:** If you sign-up for a PayScale account, we will ask for your email address and to create a password. After you create a PayScale account and log-in to our Services, you are no longer anonymous to us.
  * **Completing a salary survey:** If you complete a survey, we will ask for detailed job and compensation information that's used to generate your customized salary report and certain portions of that data will be included in our anonymous and aggregated salary database called Crowdsourced Data. You can choose to take a survey anonymously. 
  * **Browsing our Website:** We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, PayScale cookie information, and the page you requested.
  * **Requesting a Demo:** If you request a demo from us, you will be asked to provide us your contact information and relevant information about your business, so we can contact you for scheduling and demo to you the appropriate Service based on your business structure and needs. That information is stored in our internal systems to allow us to manage our relationship with you. 
  * **From businesses that buy our Services:** We may receive data such as names, job title, and salary information from your employer if your employer has purchased our compensation management Services for businesses. If your employer is a PayScale customer, you can learn from your employer about what information it shares with us, which will vary based on the Service.

You can learn more about our methodology [here.](https://www.payscale.com/about/methodology)
  * **Service communications:** Service-related announcements will be sent to you when necessary. For instance, we might send you an email if a Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. You may not opt-out of these communications because they're not promotional in nature.
  * **Promotional messages:** You may receive marketing communications from us about our Services, practical guidance about salaries and careers, or our events. For example, if you sign-up for a PayScale account but do not wish to receive any marketing emails from us, you can subscribe or unsubscribe from receiving certain types of emails through the email settings of your PayScale account.

For example, you may see an anonymous profile that includes the job title, years of experience, and salary information of another PayScale user with a similar profile as you.
  * **Service providers:** We use third-party products and services for a variety of reasons, such as for data analytics, marketing, accounting, and legal services. If we share information with a service provider, the information shared is limited to what's relevant to such provider's service, such provider's use of the information must follow our obligations under this Privacy Policy or our agreement with you, such provider must agree to appropriate confidentiality obligations in our contracts with them, and we are responsible for such provider's failure to do so unless we can show we are not responsible.
  * **Sharing Website content through social media or email:** If you share content from a Website or Service to others through a third-party operated social media or email service (including, through Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, or Twitter plugins), you understand that we track when our content is shared and that your sharing is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of the third-party provider of such service.
  * **Sale of our business or bankruptcy:** If we sell our assets to or merge with another company or file for bankruptcy, information we receive from you from our Website and Services is a PayScale asset and may be transferred. If another company buys us or a part of our business, we will have the right to continue to use your data and information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
  * **Legal Disclosures:** We reserve the right to disclose your personal data and other information solely to the extent required by applicable laws and when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights) or to comply with our legal obligations, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.



## Does PayScale use cookies and similar technologies?

## Are you located outside of the United States?

PayScale is located and headquartered in the United States (U.S.) and our Website and Services are hosted in the U.S. If you are visiting or providing information from a country outside of the U.S. with laws governing data protection, collection, or use that may differ from U.S. laws, note that you are transferring your data to the U.S., which may have different data protection laws. You can learn more about our data protection measures and our commitment to comply with applicable data protection laws [here](https://www.payscale.com/data-protection).

  * jurisdiction for any data issues shall be settled in the courts located in King County, in the State of Washington, United States of America.



## Why do I see a message that says, "Data withheld for Privacy"?

When you view a salary report, you may see a message that says, "Data withheld for privacy" (or something like it). This message is not removed until the data in our system meets applicable legal guidelines (such as the Antitrust Safety Zone established by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission you can learn about [here](https://www.justice.gov/atr/statements-antitrust-enforcement-policyin-health-care#CONTNUM_49). To protect the privacy and rights of individuals or a company, we only display data that has been rendered anonymous by removing various combinations of information, such as presenting an average or aggregate of multiple data points, limiting the base number of employers in any analysis to five or more, and pulling back from a local search to a broader geographic area. 

## Can I change my account Information and preferences?

Yes, you can edit your PayScale account information and preferences at any time. If your information changes, you may delete, correct, or update it by making the change in your PayScale account settings on your own. We retain the personal data you provide while your PayScale account is in existence or as required to provide you the Website and Services. 

## How do I deactivate my PayScale account? 

If you wish to deactivate your PayScale account, you may do so by emailing our support team at cs@payscale.com. After your PayScale account has been deactivated, you will no longer be able to access your PayScale account, but we will continue to retain certain portions of your data even after you have closed your PayScale account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreement with you, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. Also, even after your PayScale account is closed, we retain de-personalized information you have provided such as de-personalized information included in our anonymized and aggregated salary database. 

## What if I purchased a business product from PayScale?

We offer various Services for use by businesses to help them manage the compensation of their employees and attract and retain talent. You can learn more about our compensation products for businesses [here](https://www.payscale.com/hr). Our Services for businesses are generally governed by a separate agreement. If there's a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms of that agreement regarding the business Service, the terms of that agreement will control. When a business evaluates, purchases, or subscribes to our business Services, or obtains support for such Services, we collect data and information to provide and improve the Service, create improved user experiences, and operate our business. 

## Can PayScale make changes to this Privacy Policy?

Yes, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy to align with our operations and evolving laws. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here and other appropriate places. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it regularly.
