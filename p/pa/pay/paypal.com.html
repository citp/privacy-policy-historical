</strong></h3> <p>We may share your Personal Data or other information about you with others in a variety of ways as described in this section of the Privacy Policy. In addition, our Consumer Privacy Notice provides specific information about the reasons why we share the Personal Data of certain United States residents with unaffiliated third parties.</p> <p>We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:</p> <p><strong>With other members of the PayPal corporate family:</strong> We may share your Personal Data with members of the PayPal family of entities to, among other things, provide the Services you have requested or authorized; to manage risk; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements; and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of PayPal products, Services, and communications.</p> <p><strong>With other companies that provide services to us: </strong>We may share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf.&nbsp; These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and Services, or provide customer support.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>With other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product or service: </strong>We may share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product, such as with Synchrony Bank in connection with the PayPal Extras credit card.&nbsp; These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers: </strong>We may share information with the other participants to your transactions, including other Users you are sending or receiving funds from, and merchants or their service providers when you use the Services to pay for goods or services.&nbsp; The information includes:</p> <ul> <li>Personal Data necessary to facilitate the transaction;</li> </ul> <ul> <li>information to help other participant(s) resolve disputes and detect and prevent fraud; and</li> <li>aggregated data and performance analytics to help merchants better understand Users and to help merchants enhance Users’ experiences.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong>With other third parties for our business purposes or as permitted or required by law: </strong>We may share information about you with other parties for PayPal’s business purposes or as permitted or required by law, including:</p> <ul> <li>if we need to do so to comply with a law, legal process or regulations;</li> <li>to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, a court order or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or PayPal’s corporate family;</li> <li>if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;</li> </ul> <ul> <li>to protect the vital interests of a person;</li> <li>to investigate violations of or enforce a user agreement or other legal terms applicable to any Service;</li> <li>to protect our property, Services and legal rights;</li> <li>to facilitate a purchase or sale of all or part of PayPal’s business;</li> <li>in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using a Service;</li> <li>to help assess and manage risk and prevent fraud against us, our Users and fraud involving our Sites or use of our Services, including fraud that occurs at or involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.;</li> <li>to banking partners as required by card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants;</li> <li>to credit reporting and collection agencies;</li> <li>to companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by; and</li> <li>to support our audit, compliance, and corporate governance functions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>With your consent: </strong>We also will share your Personal Data and other information with your consent or direction, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, PayPal may provide aggregated statistical data to third-parties, including other businesses and members of the public, about how, when, and why Users visit our Sites and use our Services.&nbsp; This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.&nbsp; We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. <br> &nbsp;</p> <h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>VI.&nbsp; How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?&nbsp;</h3> <p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.&nbsp; For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp; When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp; Examples of account connections include:</p> <ul> <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li> <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li> <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp; For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp; If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.&nbsp; We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp; Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp; For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;</p> <h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?</h3> <p>When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online Services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a User and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services.&nbsp; Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties.&nbsp; We do not respond to DNT signals.</p> <p>Please review our <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full">Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies</a> to learn more about how we use Cookies. <br> &nbsp;</p> <h3><a id="8" name="8"></a>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Privacy Choices Are Available To You?</h3> <p>You have choices when it comes to the privacy practices and communications described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;

Please refer to the privacy notice that governs the third-party platform for more information on the choices you may have.</li> <li><strong>Choices Relating to Cookies</strong> <ul> <li>You may have options available to manage your cookies preferences.&nbsp; For example, your browser or internet device may allow you delete, disable, or block certain cookies and other tracking technologies. &nbsp;You can learn more by visiting AboutCookies.org.&nbsp; You may choose to enable these options, but doing so may prevent you from using many of the core features and functions available on a Service or Site.</li> <li>You may have an option regarding the use of cookies and other tracking technologies when you use a Service or visit parts of a Site.&nbsp; For example, you may be asked if you want the Service or Site to “remember” certain things about you, and we will use cookies and other tracking technologies to the extent that you permit them.</li> <li>You can learn more about our cookies and tracking technologies by visiting the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full">Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies</a> page.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Choices Relating to Your Registration and Account Information</strong> <ul> <li>If you have an Account, you generally may review and edit Personal Data by logging in and updating the information directly or by contacting us.&nbsp;<a href="#12">Contact us</a> if you do not have an Account or if you have questions about your Account information or other Personal Data.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Choices Relating to Communication</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Notices, Alerts and Updates from Us: </strong>&nbsp;
