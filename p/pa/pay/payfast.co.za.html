<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated on: 30 May 2007</strong></p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><span class="compName">PayFast</span> recognises the importance of protecting the personal information that you ("the User") provide to us. Therefore, we have put together, and endevour to follow this policy that respects and addresses that.</p>

We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>
<p>2.2 Consent to collect information can be express (eg. signing an agreement) or implied (eg. if the User is given an opportunity to opt-out of a specific form of information sharing, but chooses not to do so, <span class="compName">PayFast</span> implies that the User chooses to share this information with us).</p>
<p>2.3 <span class="compName">PayFast</span> processes personal information on web hosting servers which may not be in your present country.</p>

<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong>Cookies</strong> - When you visit <span class="compName">PayFast</span>, we may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences or storing session information. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, this is not advised as some features (and indeed our service itself) may not function correctly if your cookies are disabled.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use <span class="compName">PayFast</span>, our server automatically records information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. </li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong>User communications</strong> - When you send email or other communication to <span class="compName">PayFast</span>, we may retain those communications in order to process your enquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. </li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong>Links</strong> - <span class="compName">PayFast</span> may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and who followed them, either on the web site or in electronic communications. We use this information to improve the quality of our service, customized content and advertising.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><strong>Other sites</strong> - This Privacy Policy only applies to <span class="compName">PayFast</span>. We do not exercise control over any third party sites who we have partnered with to deliver a service to you. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you, over which <span class="compName">PayFast</span> has no control.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
