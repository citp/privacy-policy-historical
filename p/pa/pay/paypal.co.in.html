This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services. &nbsp;We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.</p> <h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6.&nbsp;How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?<strong>&nbsp; </strong></h3> <p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform. &nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp; When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp; Examples of account connections include:</p> <ul> <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li> <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li> <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp; For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp; If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. &nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp; Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp; For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;</p> <h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp;</h3> <p>When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online Services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a User and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services.&nbsp; Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible.</p> <p>Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. &nbsp;We do not respond to DNT signals.</p> <p>Please review our <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full">Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies</a> to learn more about how we use Cookies.</p> <h3><a id="9" name="9"></a>8.&nbsp;What Privacy Choices Are Available To You?</h3> <p>You have choices when it comes to the privacy practices and communications described in this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;
