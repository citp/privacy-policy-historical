            <p>Payvment takes your privacy very seriously and is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a means to allow you to safely make purchases on Facebook. This privacy statement describes how we collect and use the personal information you provide to Payvment. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and the steps you can take to access this information and to ensure that it is accurate.</p>
            <h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>We collect and retain the following personal information when you make a purchase: Contact information such as your name, email address and shipping address.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Facilitate your transaction with our retailer clients</li>
              <li>Retain your shipping information to pre-populate the form to make future product purchases easier.</li>
              <li>Retain items you placed in your shopping cart if you leave the cart before completing your purchase</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use technologies such as cookies to track your activity on our application or to collect personal information from you.</p>
            <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
            <p>We will share your personal information with third parties (such as shipping details to the retailer to facilitate a purchase) only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
            <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
              <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>
              <li>if Payvment is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,</li>
              <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To help protect your privacy, we allow our retailer clients only limited access to your contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions. The use of your information is also subject to the retailer’s privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any retailer you choose to make purchases from.</p>

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p>In order to make a purchase from us, you must use our payment provider to finalize and pay for your order. Its privacy statement and security practices will also apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information.</p>
