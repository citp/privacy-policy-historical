##  Information we collect

Almost all websites gather information about you when you go to them to some degree or other. We don't collect anything scary, as the way we do business is pretty simple. We may collect and use the following data about you: 

  


  * Information about your visits to our site, and which pages you visited. This is partially so we can make improvements.
  * Your loan application information. This is partially to prevent fraudulent information.
  * A record of any contact you have with us, either by phone, email, online chat or post.
  * Details of transactions you carry through our website and fulfilment of your orders.
  * Decisions made by lenders with regards to your application.



## How we use your information:

  * To provide information, products and services you request
  * To process applicationsand keep them secure
  * To monitor how people use each page of our website and service, in order to improve it.
  * To notify you about our services and special offers we think you will find valuable. This will only happen where you have consented to be contacted for these purposes. Anything we send will have information that tells you how to unsubscribe as well. If you don't want to receive anything from us, please email us at customer.support@paydaybank.co.uk.

Your details may be passed on to third parties involved in the lending process, including debt management companies and credit rating agencies. Some third parties may contact you for marketing purposes. They will have their own privacy policy and you will need to contact them separately if you want to be removed from their marketing information. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you via email or SMS for re-marketing purposes.

##  How we protect that information

As part of the lending process, your data may be transferred or stored in locations outside the European Economic Area. Staff from areas outside of the European Economic Area may process your data in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details and provide your support services, amongst other duties.

##  Disclosure of your information

There are limited scenarios where we would ever pass on your data to a third party. These are: 

  * To prospective lenders to consider whether to make a loan to you. This may, as described earlier, involve credit and identity checking, and may involve third parties as appropriate to that end.
  * To law enforcement agencies. This is if there is ever any reason to suspect fraudulent information has been used, or identity theft. This is primarily to protect your privacy and data, in case anyone ever tries to apply with your information.
  * If we sell or buy any business or assets, or if we are acquired by a third party, in which case we may disclose data to prospective sellers or buyers of such business or assets.
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use, and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of PDB UK Limited, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



We may also share your information with third parties not listed above where you have given your consent or where we are required or permitted to by any applicable law.
