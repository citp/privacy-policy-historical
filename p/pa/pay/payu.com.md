    * To authenticate and validate payments to mitigate and protect against identity theft or fraud. To do this, some of your personal and non-personal information, may be collected by PayU directly or delivered to PayU by the Merchants, and PayU will use this personal information to enter into the PayU fraud systems available for this validation and will remain there for future reference and cross-reference of information required to validate the  payments.
