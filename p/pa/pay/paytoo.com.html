				<strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
			<br>
			Thank you for visiting the PayToo Corp.’s (“PayToo”) Website. It is important to read this privacy policy before submitting any personal data or becoming a User. By using this Website or our services you agree to these terms. PayToo is referred to in this privacy policy (hereinafter referred to as “Policy”) as “PayToo,” “we,” “our,” or “us.”<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			PayToo is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We value your trust and want you to understand how we protect, collect, use and disclose the personal information you share with us.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>We collect:</strong><br>

			By choosing to order products or services from PayToo, you will need to provide us with certain personal and identification confirmation information.&nbsp;Such required information from you includes your name, the actual physical current address where you reside and/or at which you conduct your business, your valid e-mail address, your working telephone number, your date of birth, your driver's license and/or passport, together with other photographic identification as requested from time to time by PayToo. PayToo may also obtain information about your transactions with PayToo Merchant Services and/or subsidiaries and/or affiliates along with any other information for payment purposes or to comply with legal requirements.<br>
			Federal law requires PayToo to obtain, verify, and record information in order to confirm your identity. The information is provided by you and the results of the verification process will be retained by PayToo.<br>
			We limit the personal information to what is required to execute transactions and to meet the purposes set out in this privacy policy.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>How we use it</strong><br>
			PayToo uses personal information to create accounts, complete transactions, administer problems that may arise, keep records, manage our relationship, assure good service, administer business records, and directly market purposes associated with PayToo products and services.

Our agreements with service providers who may be located outside of the U.S.A. contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on using this information for any other purposes.<br>
			<br>
			If PayToo becomes involved in a proposed or actual merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all its assets, PayToo may use and disclose personal information to third parties in connection with the evaluation of the transaction. The surviving company would have access to personal information, which would continue to be subject to this privacy statement.<br>
