Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. However, laws and regulations give consumers the right to limit some, but not all, sharing of their information. The jurisdictional laws that Payoneer is regulated by require that we inform you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Additionally, they require us to provide the same information to you, upon written request and in some jurisdictions, for a nominal fee. We recommend that you read this notice carefully in order to understand what Payoneer does with your personal information.
