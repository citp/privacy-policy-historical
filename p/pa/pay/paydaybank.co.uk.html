            The Data Protection Act</h2>
        <p>
            For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller. We
            are a company incorporated in England and Wales with Company No. 06617413 and our
            registered office is 28-32 Wellington Road, London, NW8 9SP. Our data protection
            register is #Z1696368.</p>
        <p>
            This policy only applies to the collection of your data by us and those we authorise.
            We may link to third party websites that have their own privacy policy. We do not
            accept any responsibility or liability for these policies, so please check them
            before submitting any personal data.</p>
 
        <h2 id="collectinformation">
            Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
            Almost all websites gather information about you when you go to them to some degree
            or other. We don't collect anything scary, as the way we do business is pretty simple.
            We may collect and use the following data about you:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Information about your visits to our site, and which pages you visited. This is
                partially so we can make improvements.</li>
            <li>Your loan application information. This is partially to prevent fraudulent information.</li>
            <li>A record of any contact you have with us, either by phone, email, online chat or
                post.</li>
            <li>Details of transactions you carry through our website and fulfilment of your orders.</li>
            <li>Decisions made by lenders with regards to your application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="information">
            How we use your information:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To carry out business, including our obligations that arise from any contracts entered
                into between you and us.</li>
            <li>To provide information, products and services you request</li>
            <li>To process applicationsand keep them secure</li>
            <li>To monitor how people use each page of our website and service, in order to improve
                it.</li>
            <li>To notify you about our services and special offers we think you will find valuable.
                This will only happen where you have consented to be contacted for these purposes.
                Anything we send will have information that tells you how to unsubscribe as well.
                If you don't want to receive anything from us, please email us at <a href="mailto:customer.support@paydaybank.co.uk">
                    customer.support@paydaybank.co.uk.</a>.</li>
            <li>We send it to our lenders in order that they can make lending decisions, and also
                conduct identity verification, credit checking, fraud prevention and debt collection
                where necessary.</li>
            <li>To evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing of our website and statistical analysis.</li>

        <p>
            Your details may be passed on to third parties involved in the lending process,
            including debt management companies and credit rating agencies. Some third parties
            may contact you for marketing purposes. They will have their own privacy policy
            and you will need to contact them separately if you want to be removed from their
            marketing information. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you via email, telephone or SMS for re-marketing purposes. Unless you opt out of future marketing campaigns when you apply with us, we may follow up your application with a courtesy call from one of our Customer Services team to see how you found the process and to offer any further assistance if required.</p>
        <h2 id="protect">

            outside the European Economic Area. Staff from areas outside of the European Economic
            Area may process your data in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details
            and provide your support services, amongst other duties. By submitting your personal
            data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps
            reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance
            with this privacy policy at all times. We store all and any information you provide
            to us on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL
            technology to ensure the maximum protection we can provide.</p>

            If you would prefer not to use cookies, you can opt out of it by changing your browser

        <p>
            Just go to “Tools” on your internet browser. On some browsers, this may be an icon
            of a spanner or gears.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then go to “Options”, “Preferences” or “Settings”, depending on the browser you
            are using.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The cookies setting will be either in “Privacy”, “Advanced” or “Under the hood”,
            depending on the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will then be able to select your settings as required.

        <h2 id="Disclosure">
            Disclosure of your information</h2>
        <p>
            There are limited scenarios where we would ever pass on your data to a third party.
            These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To prospective lenders to consider whether to make a loan to you. This may, as described
                earlier, involve credit and identity checking, and may involve third parties as
                appropriate to that end.</li>
            <li>To law enforcement agencies. This is if there is ever any reason to suspect fraudulent
                information has been used, or identity theft. This is primarily to protect your
                privacy and data, in case anyone ever tries to apply with your information.</li>
            <li>If we sell or buy any business or assets, or if we are acquired by a third party,
                in which case we may disclose data to prospective sellers or buyers of such business
                or assets.</li>
            <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply
                with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use, and
                other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of Money Gap Group Limited,
                our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
                and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may also share your information with third parties not listed above where you
            have given your consent or where we are required or permitted to by any applicable
            law.</p>

            <h2 id="fraud">Fraud Prevention</h2>
                                        <p>If false or inaccurate information is provided, including in relation to a person's identity and fraud is suspected or identified, details about this information, including customer Personal Data, will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent and detect crime, fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications for credit and credit related and other facilities; managing credit and credit related accounts or other facilities; recovering debt; checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and checking details of job applicants and employees. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.
