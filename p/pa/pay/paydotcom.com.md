EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the
following safeguard is implemented :

   or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal
   information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable

EU RESIDENTS: YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
You have the right to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access
request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to
check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have
any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully
exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with
local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want
to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for
direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate
grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to
suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
establish the information's accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not
want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as
you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your
information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you,
or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with
you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal
information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services
to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
