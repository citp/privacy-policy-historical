                    We recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned 
                    about the information they provide to us and how we treat 
                    that information. So we have developed a Privacy Policy to 
                    address those concerns. We may update the Policy from time 
                    to time, so please check in occasionally.

                      At our site, we do not collect personally identifiable information 
                      from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily 
                      and knowingly. This means we do not require you to register 
                      or provide information to us in order to view our site. 
                      If you register in order to use the feedback features of 
                      our site, we use the information you supply for the purpose 
                      of providing the services you have requested. If you specifically 
                      agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on 
                      our mailing list when you registered, we also may contact 
                      you from time to time. You can always change your preference 
                      for follow-up contacts just by e-mailing us at any time. 
                      We do not share any information you give us with anyone 
                      outside of our company.

                      In the Mailing List section of our site, we may ask for 
                      some personally identifiable information, such as your name, 
                      address and phone number. We use this information only if 
                      we need to contact you directly because our attempts to 
                      contact you by e-mail were unsuccessful. We do not use the
