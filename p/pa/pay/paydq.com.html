<p>The Site may collect certain information about your visit such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Site. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site. </p>
<h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.</p>
<p>In support of these uses, PAYDQ may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related PAYDQ products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests.</p>
<p>PAYDQ may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on PAYDQ or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PAYDQ and our family of websites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of PAYDQ employees or agents, users of PAYDQ products or services, or members of the public.</p>
<h2>Control of Your Personal Information</h2>
