    clients personal information safe. The security and confidence of our clients is an ongoing
    focus of our company.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION</b><br>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure online experience. We
        maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with U.S. standards to
        transmit and store information about you.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</b><br>
      <p>We collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from several sources:</p>

        <li>Information you provide on your application</li>
        <li>Your transaction and experience history</li>
        <li>Information from consumer reporting and similar agencies</li>
        <li>Non-personally identifiable information such as URL and TCP/IP information</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br>
      <p>The information we collect about you is primarily used to provide services to you or to 
        facilitate loans or other services that you request.  We may also use your information to 
        resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you.  Although we
        may disclose information we collect and retain, its use will be limited to what we 
        reasonably believe is appropriate and necessary to carry on our business and to facilitate
        your application for the services and/or products you expect and deserve.  In addition,
        unless you opt-out as specified herein, we may share the information with affiliates or
        other companies for any legal purpose, including developing certain demographic or other
        models for commercial use.
