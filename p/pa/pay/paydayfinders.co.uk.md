# PayDayFinders Privacy Policy

Welcome to the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for Pay Day Finders based in London, United Kingdom.

Your privacy is very important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn about ways in which we use and protect your personal information. 

This Privacy Policy applies from 28th October 2008 for new registering users.

The following policy explains how we gather and use personal information in detail. This policy may change from time to time and Pay Day Finders reserves the right to change or modify this policy at any time with or without notice. If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to contact us. 

## Registration

Pay Day Finders only collects personally identifiable information ("PII") that is volunteered during the registration process or in response to specific information requests. Examples of PII that may be requested include: first and last name, address, email address, and telephone number. Anybody completing and submitting any of the forms (including our newsletter) on the Pay Day Finders domain is considered a "registrant." In addition, Pay Day Finders may collect your IP address and information through use of electronic "cookies." 

By using this Site, you agree that you will be registered with Pay Day Finders, and that you accept this Privacy Policy. You will not be registered merely by visiting the Site; you will only be registered if you affirmatively click on one of the Site's options to directly match you with a loan or provide other services. Also, by providing us with your personal information on our Site or in the course of using our services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data, and any other data we acquire about you from third-party service providers in the process of evaluating you for a loan, to companies outside the EU, including but not limited to, the Network Sites and other consumer credit lenders and their affiliates. 

When you register with Pay Day Finders you automatically consent to registration in all the other online properties in the Pay Day Finders network (collectively, the "Network Sites"). Accordingly, Pay Day Finders may share registrant PII with the Network Sites. 

## Use and Sharing of PII

Pay Day Finders reserves the right to use registrant PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided (including matching registrants with a cash advance loan company or companies); (2) as disclosed at the time such information is provided; and (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However, please note that Pay Day Finders may change this Policy at any time and therefore Pay Day Finders may in the future use registrant PII for additional purposes not currently included in this Policy. 

## Use of Your Data

Please note that your data may be passed to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. This allows lenders to make their lending decisions, which may involve their passing data onto credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to conduct identity verification, fraud prevention and credit checking. 

The data we collect during registration with us or during the application process may be shared/sold to trusted third parties who may also contact you about other products and services. These third parties may contact you via telephone, email and/or SMS. Any third party receiving your data will always give you the option to unsubscribe from receiving information in respect of such offers and/or services/products. Those third parties will not then share/sell your data with others unless you specifically provide consent to them allowing them to do so. Third parties with whom we work take all appropriate and reasonable steps to ensure that your data is protected. Please note that your personal data may be transferred outside the European Union and into the United States. 

## Use of Individual Information

The following paragraph describes how Pay Day Finders currently uses Individual Information, but Pay Day Finders may change or broaden its use at any time. Pay Day Finders may update this policy from time to time. Pay Day Finders may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.

## Email and Unsubscribe Policy

Pay Day Finders uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. Promotional offers include third party marketing messages as well as email advertising from partners and affiliates of Pay Day Finders. Pay Day Finders may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list and/or to unsubscribe from all Pay Day Finders's email list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe.

Pay Day Finders's unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by Pay Day Finders's on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.

You should also note that unsubscribing from Pay Day Finders's electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's information from any Third Party business associates and licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from Pay Day Finders, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.

## Content of Email Messages

In certain commercial email messages sent by Pay Day Finders, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to Pay Day Finders. The "Subject:" line of Company email messages will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to Pay Day Finders or from Pay Day Finders in its own promotions.

## Solicited Email

Pay Day Finders only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from Pay Day Finders or to individuals who have agreed on a Third Party website to receive email from Third Parties. As such, Pay Day Finders does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, The United Kingdom's statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email may not be applicable to Company's email messages.

## Fraud Prevention

If false or inaccurate information is provided, including in relation to a person's identity and fraud is identified, details about this information, including customer Personal Data, will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. The lender and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications for credit and credit related and other facilities; managing credit and credit related accounts or other facilities; recovering debt; checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and checking details of job applicants and employees. The lender and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. For further details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies please contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy.
