     1. TYPES AND USES OF INFORMATION

        payroll products and employee benefit services. This may include contact information
        such as name, email address, telephone number, and company name, and perhaps
        other data.
     b. Paybooks also may monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help refine and
        improve the design and layout of the website as well as the user experience. As a result,
        Paybooks automatically tracks certain information about site visitors. This information
        includes the users’ browser type, most recent URL and the next URL that the user visits,
        regardless of whether these URLs are on the Paybooks website or not. Paybooks also
        will track visitors’ IP addresses. Paybooks uses this information to, among other things,
        identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to
        users’ interests.
     c. Any personal information given to us through our website is used exclusively by

     d. Paybooks does not collect e-mail addresses without the site visitor voluntarily providing
        us with this information (typically via our online information or demo request form,
        whitepaper request form, and other website forms and surveys). Paybooks will


   periodically use that contact information to send visitors e-mail or other
   communications for sales, service, support and marketing purposes. Visitors who do not
   wish to receive marketing e-mail from Paybooks in the future may opt out of receiving
   these communications by following the instructions included in each communication.
