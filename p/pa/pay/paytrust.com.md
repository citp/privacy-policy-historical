# Paytrust online bill pay service privacy policy

    **More about services offered on the paytrust.quicken.com site**
Paytrust Enrollment.
    

The enrollment page is hosted by Metavante Payment Services, LLC on behalf of Quicken. Metavante is not permitted to use your information for any other purpose than to provide you the Paytrust services you are requesting.

Receiving Bills Online.
    

If you choose to receive bills online, your bills will be sent electronically or by mail to the Paytrust processing center. The information you provide to Paytrust for these services, as well as your bills and billing information, is stored on Paytrust servers using industry-recognized security safeguards. Bills are presented to you online within your password protected Paytrust Service.

Electronic Billing Statements.
    

For some payees, Paytrust can retrieve an electronic version of your bill directly from your payee's Web site. To receive bills this way, you provide Paytrust with the user names and passwords for your payee Web sites. Paytrust downloads and saves an HTML or PDF representation of your bill.

You may also have some payees send your electronic billing data directly to Paytrust. Paytrust verifies your payee account information with your payee and then instructs your payee to either display your bill information or transmit your bill information to Paytrust.

Paper Billing Statements.
    

For payees from whom we do not receive billing data electronically, you may have your paper bills mailed to Paytrust. Your paper bills are scanned into the Paytrust system. Scanned bills are shredded prior to being discarded.

Real Balance Feature.
    

The Real Balance feature combines your online bank account activity with your bill payment record so you have the most updated and accurate picture of your bank balance. If you request, Paytrust will store your online bank accounts' User IDs so that you don't need to enter them each time you update your Real Balance statement. You must enter your password(s) each time you update your Real Balance information. To provide this service, Paytrust stores your transaction information for your bank account - who was paid, how much was paid and what the check number was used. Available balance is also stored for calculating your Real Balance information.
