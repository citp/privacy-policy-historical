# Paytoo - Privacy Policy

### Paytoo’s Privacy Policy 

Thank you for visiting our website. Please read this Privacy Policy before using our website, submitting any personal data, or becoming a customer. By using this website or our services you agree to these terms. 

Paytoo is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We value your trust and want you to understand how we protect, collect, use and disclose the personal information you share with us.

### Why and What we collect:

We ask you for your personal information for the following purposes:

* To facilitate the provision of the products and services you request from us including verification of your identity;
  

* To provide you with information and offers on our products and services, that we believe may be of interest to you, and in certain circumstances to allow Paymotech group companies (that is, Paymotech subsidiaries and affiliates) to provide you with information about their own products or services; and 
*   

* To comply with the law.
* If you choose to order products or services from us, you will have to provide us with certain information, including personal information such as: your name, mailing and/or e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth, Driver’s License or passport and/or other photographic identification. We may also obtain information about your transactions with us and/or our group companies and other information for payment purposes or to comply with legal requirements.

Federal law requires us to obtain, verify and record information in order to confirm your identity. This information will include your name, address, date of birth and any other information required in order to complete the verification process. The information provided by you and the results of the verification process will be retained by Paymotech.

We limit the personal information we collect to only that which is required to execute transactions, provide you with information about our products and services, and to meet the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

### How we use it

We use personal information to create an account for you, to complete your transactions; to administer any problems that may arise in effecting the transactions; to keep our records up to date; to better understand and manage our ongoing relationship with you; to assure good service; to manage and administer our business and records; to administer and manage your account; for direct marketing purposes associated with Paytoo products and services, unless you tell us that you would not like to receive it; for market research; to manage, administer, collect or otherwise enforce accounts; to maintain business records for reasonable periods; to meet legal, regulatory, insurance, security and processing requirements; to prevent fraud and abuse and other actual and potential prohibited or illegal activities, and otherwise with consent or as permitted or required by law. As permitted by applicable law, we may merge personal information with public information or other information received from reputable vendors, to update contact information.

### Who we share it with

We may share all of the information, as described above, with our affiliates and/or our agents to assist us in our business activities for the uses described in **"How we use it"** , and for other purposes as permitted or required by applicable law. Disclosures permitted or required by law include cooperation with criminal or government investigations, fraud prevention and detection, and responses to a court order or subpoena. If fraud is suspected in your money transfer, Paymotech will share your money transfer information with relevant national, state and local law enforcement in the US and other countries, which may further share the information. In limited situations, our agents and/or affiliates may use information about you to offer products and services to you in compliance with their privacy policy. Paymotech affiliates and agents are bound by appropriate data safeguarding obligations. Our agents and affiliates are located across the globe, where they may be subject to required legal disclosure of collected personal information to governmental authorities.

Paymotech may disclose some or all of the personal information to service providers for the purposes of processing requested transactions or to perform business support functions on our behalf including marketing and similar services. Our agreements with these service providers, who may be located outside of the US, contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on using this information for any other purposes.

If Paymotech becomes involved in a proposed or actual merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all its assets, we may use and disclose personal information to third parties in connection with the evaluation of the transaction. The surviving company would have access to personal information, which would continue to be subject to this privacy statement.

### Data Security

Paymotech uses physical, electronic and procedural security measures to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Paymotech uses industry–standard practices and security measures to safeguard such information.

Access to personal information is restricted to employees, service providers and mandataries who need to have access to that information as described in this privacy statement. Our service providers are required to observe standards for the security, collection, use and sharing of personal information, and to comply with applicable law.
