PayToo may disclose some or all personal information to service providers for processing requested transactions or performing business support functions on our behalf. Our agreements with service providers who may be located outside of the U.S.A. contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on using this information for any other purposes.

If PayToo becomes involved in a proposed or actual merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all its assets, PayToo may use and disclose personal information to third parties in connection with the evaluation of the transaction. The surviving company would have access to personal information, which would continue to be subject to this privacy statement.
