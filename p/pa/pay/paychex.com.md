### Biometrics – Collection, Transmission, Retention and Destruction

For the purposes of this Policy, “biometrics” may include an individual’s physiological characteristics that can be used, singly or in combination with each other or with other identifying data, to establish individual identity. Examples of biometrics include, but are not limited to, imagery of the iris, retina, fingerprint, face, hand, palm, vein patterns, and voice recordings, from which an identifier template, such as a faceprint, a minutiae template, or a voiceprint, can be extracted.

In addition, the employees of Paychex customers that use Paychex timekeeping devices may provide an iris, finger or facial scan as part of the timekeeping process, which the technology converts into a mathematical, encrypted algorithm, or template. These templates are sometimes called “biometrics.” For purposes of this Policy, Paychex broadly includes within the term “biometrics” the templates created in the timekeeping process, and even where not required to do so, Paychex complies with all laws related to the use of biometrics. Some details about biometrics:

### Biometric Collection

  * Biometrics are collected by employers from employees using Paychex’s timekeeping technology.
  * Some laws require employers to provide employees with notice of the use of biometrics in timekeeping, and to obtain employee consent.
  * Paychex timekeeping devices have “notice and consent” screens that employers can use to provide notice and obtain consent during the enrollment process, or employers can choose to obtain consent from employees through other means. Newer Paychex timekeeping devices require the use of Paychex notice and consent screens.
  * If a customer’s employee is using biometrics to record time, Paychex will presume one or more of the above notice and consent processes are being followed at the customer’s worksite.
  * Note: Some applications allow the use of a smartphone device, and the device itself collects biometrics for access to the application. The consent process is part of the smartphone, and is controlled by the user/employee. When smartphone devices are used, geolocation information may be provided to the employer to ensure that employees are located at their appropriate work location.



### Biometric Transmission and Storage

  * Following collection at the employer’s worksite, the resulting templates are stored in the timekeeping device, and are also transmitted for storage on a database hosted by either the customer, Paychex or a third-party web hosting service.
  * Paychex requires that reasonable care be used for transmission of biometrics to storage on any Paychex-hosted or third-party database.
  * Paychex provides secure transmission and storage for biometrics, which use reasonable standards of care within Paychex’s industry, and which are the same as the manner in which other confidential and sensitive information is transmitted and stored.
  * Paychex does not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from biometrics.
  * Paychex collects latitude and longitude coordinates from the device as part of the timekeeping process when geolocation services are enabled.



### Biometric Destruction

  * Biometric templates are and remain the property of the customer/employer, which is responsible for biometric template destruction when the biometric template is no longer needed, or within (1) year from the employer’s last contact with an employee, whichever is first.
  * When instructed by its customers to destroy biometric templates, Paychex will promptly comply with that request.
  * Paychex will destroy the biometric templates of former or inactive customers who fail to destroy such data, within a reasonable time period after Paychex’s last interaction with the customer.



### How aggregated, non-personal information is used

We may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the users of the Site and our services to determine information regarding the use of our Site and general information about our customers. We may also group this information to provide general aggregated data, such as the Paychex Small Business Jobs Index or the SurePayroll Small Business Scorecard. The aggregated data will not personally identify any customers or visitors to the Site.
