        <li>
          <p>We may as a result of your interaction with the Website store and process your information on MEM Consumer Finance Limited’s (MEM) computers and in any other way.&nbsp; By "your information" we mean personal and financial information we (a) obtain from you or from third parties, such as credit reference agencies (who may search the Electoral Register), fraud prevention agencies or other organisations when you apply for an account or any other product or service or which you or they give to us at any other time or (b) learn from the way you use and manage your account(s), from your transactions and from the payments made to your account. </p>
          <p> We will use your information to manage your account(s), give you statements and provide our services, for research, assessment and analysis (including credit and/or behaviour scoring, market and product analysis) and to develop and improve our services to you and other customers and protect our interests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>We, and other carefully selected third parties, will use your information to inform you by post, fax, telephone or other electronic means, about other products and services (including those of others) which we believe may be of interest to you.</li>
        <li>If you are not eligible for a Payday loan at this time, unless you write to the address below, you agree that we may offer you an alternative product (including those of others) and that we may pass your details to another financial services company for them to send you details of their products.</li>
        <li>If you do not want to receive information about other products and services please contact our Customer Relations Department, MEM Consumer Finance Limited, PO BOX 255, Bicester, Oxon, OX26 4ZY.</li>
        <li>You can ask us in writing from the same address for a copy of the information we keep about you. A fee will be charged for this service.</li>
        <li>If you were introduced to us by a third party, we will give them your contact details and sufficient information about you for their accounting and administration purposes.</li>
        <li>We may give information about you and how you manage your account to the following:
          <ol>
            <li>People who provide a service to us or are acting as our agents, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential.&nbsp; If they are located in another country we will make sure that they agree to apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to information held in the UK and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us;</li>
            <li>Anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under this agreement.</li>
            <li>We may also give out information about you if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to do so. </li>
          </ol>
          Otherwise we will keep information about you confidential. Calls between us may be recorded and/or monitored.</li>
        <li>Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies
          <p>When you apply for a product or service you confirm that all the information you have given is true and complete. When you apply for a product or service you authorise us to check the following records about you and others (see below);&nbsp;a) our own; b) those at credit reference agencies (CRAs). When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information. c) those at fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
          <p>We will make checks such as; assessing this application for credit and we may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us. </p>
          <p>If you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together so you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them. CRAs also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link. </p>
          <p> Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your accounts and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.</p>
          <p>If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies.</p>
          <p>Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. </p>
          <p>We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:</p>
          <p>Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities</p>
          <p>Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities </p>
          <p>Recovering debt</p>
          <p>Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance</p>
          <p>Checking details of job applicants and employees</p>
          <p>We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</p>
          <p>Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
        </li>
        <li>How to find out more
