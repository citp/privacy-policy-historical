</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Sharing your information with third parties
<div style="margin-left: 2em;"><ol>
<li>We may share your personal information with any member of our group of affiliated companies who may process your personal information for the purposes specified in this privacy policy. For more information about our group of affiliated companies, please <a href="/Content/Media/a507247b557a4f31b976d46e77d12775/GroupCompaniesforSharing-Clause3113-2-12.pdf" target="_blank" title="Group Companies for Sharing - Clause 3 1 13-2-12">click here</a>. The list of our group of affiliated companies with whom your data may be shared will change from time to time, so please ensure that you revisit this link regularly</li>
<li>Sometimes (and with your approval where required), we'll share your information with carefully selected third parties outside our group. We may do this for the following reasons:<ol>
<li>To provide you with a loan. As brokers as well as direct lenders, our products and services are sometimes provided in conjunction with our business partners. It will therefore be necessary to disclose your information to them to provide you with the products and/or services you require.</li>
<li>To our agents, staff and approved third parties to carry out services for us.</li>
<li>To facilitate the processing and collection of direct debits or other payments due from you under the loan agreement, we may also share your personal data with third party payment processing service providers.</li>
<li>To provide you with information about special promotions and offers as referred to in the "Keeping You Informed" section below.</li>
<li>To protect us, our group of affiliated companies or others. We may share your information with third parties when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or protect our or another person's rights, property, or safety. This includes exchanging information with third parties (such as other lenders, law enforcement agencies and regulatory authorities) to protect against fraud and reduce risks.</li>
<li>If there is (or is to be) any change in ownership of our business or assets then we may wish to share your information so that the new (prospective) owners may continue to operate our business effectively and continue to provide services to our customers. This may include new shareholders or any organisation that might take an assignment or transfer of any agreements we have entered into with our customers.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></div>
<p>We will place appropriate obligations and restrictions on third parties to protect your details.</p>
<ol>
<li>In some circumstances, your details may be passed to another lender (not necessarily within our group of affiliated companies) who may be able to offer you a payday loan. Please refer to the relevant pages within the loan application process for further information.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Credit reference &amp; fraud prevention agencies<ol>
<li>We may use credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to help us make decisions.</li>
<li>When you apply to us to open an account, we will check the following records about you and others:<ol>
<li>our own;</li>
<li>those at credit reference agencies (CRAs). When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.</li>
<li>those at fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We will make checks such as assessing this application for credit and verifying identities to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs in order to refresh our records and manage your account with us, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit, focus the relevance of the marketing communications that we send to you, and/or ensure that we comply with our obligations regarding responsible lending.</li>
<li>If you are making a joint application or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together so you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them. CRAs also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</li>
<li>Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your accounts and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.</li>
<li>If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect or identify fraud we will record this and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention. Law enforcement agencies (such as the police, HMRC and other regulatory bodies) may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:<br><ol>
<li>Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;</li>
<li>Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;</li>
<li>Recovering debt;</li>
<li>Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance;</li>
<li>Checking details of job applicants and employees.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover debts.</li>
<li>We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</li>
<li>Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.</li>
<li>This section is a condensed explanation of how personal information is used for credit referencing and fraud prevention purposes. If you would like to read the full details of how your credit reference data may be used please refer to "A Guide to the use of your personal information by PaydayUK and at Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies" by <a href="/Content/Media/4248b4ffde6e42cb98e6b499a9b141c9/fpn-full-leaflet-12-12.pdf" target="_blank" title="fpn-full-leaflet-12-12">clicking here</a>.</li>
<li>You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK; the information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge you a small statutory fee, currently £2.00.<ol>

<li>Use of your information outside of the UK<ol>
<li>Some companies within our group of affiliated companies, and sometimes other third parties with whom we share personal information are or may be located outside the UK; for example, Dollar Financial Group, Inc. is located in the USA. We implement safeguards within our group of affiliated companies and with relevant third parties to ensure the appropriate levels of protection for all such information. <a href="/Content/Media/dbea6e246d22459eabd0952a87afe5bf/20110713_DFGPrivacyPolicy.pdf" target="_blank" title="20110713_DFGPrivacyPolicy">Click to view Dollar Financial Group, Inc.'s Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</a>.</li>

<li>Methods of contact<ol>
<li>Unless you have advised us to the contrary, both we and any other broker, lender or third party referred to above may contact you by telephone, SMS, post, e-mail, fax or automated message. (Please see the 'Keeping You Informed' section below regarding how you may be contacted for direct marketing purposes).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How long do we keep your information?<ol>
<li>How long we keep your information for depends on the basis on which it was provided, generally however:<ol>
<li>We will keep the information that is necessary to enable us to provide you with a service that you have requested through this website for as long as it takes us to provide that service.</li>
<li>If you have asked that we do not use your details for marketing purposes, we may still need to keep them to ensure our systems reflect your preferences.</li>
<li>We will generally keep records of any transactions you enter into on this website for a minimum of six years from the end of the relationship. This is so that we can respond to any complaints or disputes that arise in that period. Otherwise we will keep the information where appropriate for legitimate business needs.</li>
<li>We will keep other information about you if it is necessary for us to do so to comply with the law, or where appropriate for legitimate business needs.</li>

<li><a id="third-parties" name="third-parties"></a>Keeping you informed<ol>
<li>From time to time we would like to contact you by SMS, post, email, telephone or automated message, with offers relating to products of ours which we think you might be interested in.</li>
<li>We may also wish to share some of your information (including all the contact details that we hold for you) with trusted third parties so that they can also provide you with information (using the same methods to contact you) about products and services that might be of interest to you. One of the reasons that we wish to share your data with such third parties, including the application details you have already provided, is that they may be able to offer you a loan in the event that you are unsuccessful in obtaining a loan from Payday UK. One of our third party intermediaries will then consider your details and may forward these details to another lender, which may involve them completing a further credit check. You will be contacted by any lender who may have considered your application to advise you if your application has been unsuccessful. Other intermediaries and lenders will have their own privacy policies. Please refer to them.</li>
<li>When you submit your application, you will be asked to agree to the use of your information in clause 8 above.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Accessing personal information we hold about you<ol>
<li>Subject to certain exceptions, you have the right of access to your personal records and information that we hold about you, upon written request and payment of a charge of up to £10. You will need to make a separate request and pay a separate fee for each company within our group of affiliated companies whose records you wish to access.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Update your details/preferences<ol>
<li>If any data or information we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date then please let us know and this will be corrected where appropriate.</li>
<li>To revise your marketing contact preferences, or to access, correct or amend your records you should contact the Data Protection Officer (see "Contact Our Data Protection Officer" below).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Security and confidentiality<ol>
<li>Appreciating that both privacy and security of your information is of the utmost importance, we have implemented technology and security policies, rules and measures to protect the personal information we hold about you.</li>
<li>We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information. However, please be aware that there are inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet and we cannot therefore guarantee the security of any data disclosed online. We ask that you do not provide us with any sensitive personal information online (please see the 'Sensitive Information' Section below) unless we specifically ask for this.</li>
