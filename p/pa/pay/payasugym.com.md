Please note that we recommend all of our gym Partners request that you provide them with proof of identity on arrival at the gym in order to ensure you are the purchaser of the Pass Code.  Acceptable forms of identification typically include passport, driving licence, ID card etc. However, please read the venue description carefully as a small number of venues will insist on photographic ID only. Where this is the case we include a note to this effect on the venue description. 

Please note that each Pass Code you purchase will only grant _you_  access to a venue. You may not share your codes with others, or purchase codes on behalf of someone else. If you cannot provide ID which matches the Pass Code purchaser details then you will be prevented from accessing venues. 

When using PayAsUGym services, you also shall be subject to any posted guidelines, FAQs, or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time.

**DAY PASS**. All One Day Passes are valid for one single entrance to the gym it was purchased for, and can be used within a period of 30 days. If a pass is not used within the 30 day validity period the pass will be invalid and you will lose the value, this pass will be marked ‘Expired’ in the ‘My Account’ section. You may refund an unused One Day Pass at any point during its 30 day validity period. Refunds for One Day Passes are in the form of bonus credit, which can be used to purchase any of the products on our website, and will be valid for 30 days from the date of the refund. Once used, a One Day Pass may not be refunded.

  A One Day Pass purchased with bonus credit can be refunded, however the bonus credit will only be credited back into the account if it is valid and has not expired during the period while the pass was not used. A One Day Pass purchased with a ‘First Pass Free’ promotion can be cancelled but no funds will be transferred back into the registered user’s account.

  **BUNDLES OF DAY PASSES**. Bundle products are multiple single use passes which are sold at a discounted price than the corresponding individual pass.

A 10 Day Pass will give the user access to the venue the pass was purchased for 10 times within the 60 day validity period. Unused bundle products are refundable within 14 days of purchase through Customer Service. Bundle products will not be refunded once they have been used. In the exceptional circumstance that a venue closes down before the entire pass has been used, the user will be refunded for their remaining visits, at the discounted price that the passes were purchased for.

**30 AND 90 DAY PASSES**. 30 Day and 90 Day Passes are valid for an unlimited number of entries to the club that they have been purchased for. 30 and 90 Day Passes are only valid for the individual who has purchased them. 30 Day Passes are valid for 30 days from the selected start date. 90 Day Passes are valid for 90 days from the selected start date.

We take all reasonable measures to ensure that the class timetables on PayAsUGym are up-to-date. There may be some occasions where the information that we have on the website has not been updated.  In these instances, a refund will be processed in the form of credit by which the pass was originally purchased. 

### MONTHLY PASSES

Monthly passes are valid for an uncapped number of entries to the club that they have been purchased for. All monthly passes are valid only for the individual who has purchased them. A maximum of 50% of the total payment for any Monthly Pass can be made using bonus credit.

**RECURRING BILLING OF MONTHLY PASSES**. All Monthly Passes will be billed monthly, on the same date each month. By starting your Monthly Pass you authorise us to charge you a monthly membership fee, the 'Monthly Renewal Payment', at the then current rate. A maximum of 50% bonus credit can be applied for recurring monthly payments.

**PAYMENT METHODS FOR MONTHLY PASSES**. You may edit your payment method information at any time by logging into your account or by contacting Customer Service. If an applicable payment is not successfully settled, for any reason, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.

**CANCELLATION OF MONTHLY PASSES (outside of initial 14-day membership period)**. Monthly Passes with a minimum period of 1 month can be cancelled at any time after the first 14 days after the first purchase (where the first purchase counts only as the initial Monthly payment, not a renewal payment) to prevent the next Monthly Renewal Payment from being billed. The user will be able to use the Pass until the end of their current monthly billing cycle once cancelled. UNLESS EXPRESSLY STATED TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, OR AS PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members. The amount and form of such refunds or discounts and the decision to provide them, are at PayAsUGym's sole and absolute discretion.

**RIGHT TO CANCEL WITHIN 14 DAYS OF PURCHASE FOR MONTHLY PASSES**. The user has the right to cancel their Monthly Pass within 14 days of the initial sign up date (where the initial sign up date is the date of the first Monthly payment, not a renewal payment) without giving any reason. The user can cancel the membership through their PayAsUGym or by contacting Customer Service. An Admin fee will be charged if the Pass has been used within the initial 14 days, calculated using the day pass price of the venue that the user has purchased the pass for, multiplied by the number of visits made to any venue prior to cancellation. We may at our own discretion waive any fees incurred. We will make any reimbursements no later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel your membership.

**ACCESS TO OTHER VENUES WITH A MONTHLY PASS**. With a Monthly Pass, the user will be able to access all the gyms included with their pass, an up to date list of venues included will always be available via the customer’s account. Access to venues is worked out using the price the customer pays, and the gym’s own PayAsUGym monthly pass price. Access to venues may vary depending on price changes to the monthly pass price, and availability of the monthly pass at each venue. A list of available venues that you can visit with your Monthly Pass will be available in your PayAsUGym account when logged in.

**PAUSING A MONTHLY PASS**. With a Monthly Pass, the user will have the option to pause their pass for a temporary period. While a user is paused, they will not have access to any venues with their Monthly+ Pass.

**IF A USER HAS NOT USED THEIR PASS SINCE THEIR MOST RECENT PAYMENT (INCLUDING INITIAL PAYMENT)**. The user will have the option to pause with immediate effect, which will give the user their next renewal payment for free (provided the renewal payment goes through within 6 months from date of pausing). The user will also have the option to pause from the end of their current billing cycle – this will end the user’s access to all venues after the end of their billing cycle is reached and no payment will be taken until the user resumes their pass (either by selecting a defined period to pause their pass for, or by selecting the resume option in their account while paused).

**IF A USER HAS USED THEIR PASS SINCE THEIR MOST RECENT PAYMENT (INCLUDING INITIAL PAYMENT)**. The user will be able to pause from the end of their billing cycle. This will end the user’s access to all venues after the end of their billing cycle is reached and no payment will be taken until the user resumes their pass (either by selecting a defined period to pause their pass for, or by selecting the resume option in their account while paused).

**RESUMING A PAUSED PASS**. When a user pauses a pass, they have the option to pause for a defined period (1 or 3 months), or an undefined period. If the user has paused for 1 or 3 months, their Monthly+ Pass will automatically resume on the date stated during the pause process, in the user's account and pause confirmation email. If the user has paused for an undefined period, their Monthly+ Pass will remain paused until the user manually selects to resume their pass via their PayAsUGym account. If the user has received a free renewal month, this must be used within 6 months of the user selecting to pause. After 6 months, the free renewal month will expire. If the user is not eligible for a free renewal, they will be charged at their normal renewal price. The price will be confirmed before the payment is taken.

## 10\. MINIMUM AGE TO PURCHASE A PASS

You have to be aged 16 years or above to purchase a pass. However some of our Partners allow parents and other legal guardians to purchase passes to be used at Partner gyms for children under 16 in their care. This is most likely to be the case for Local Leisure Centre facilities where swimming passes are available. As it is entirely under the discretion of the gym you are advised to check with the Partner that you intend to visit if you would like to purchase a pass for children less than 16 years of age. Some of our Partners do require customers to be at least 18 years of age in order to purchase a pass, this will be made clear at time of booking. 

## 11\. VOUCHERS, DISCOUNTS AND PROMOTIONS

We do from time to time, we make vouchers and discounts available through affiliate websites or email promotions. Where applicable, the expiry date and validity period of a voucher or discount will be stated in any communications from us. We cannot guarantee the validity of voucher codes or discounts on websites not endorsed by ourselves. Vouchers and discounts will vary in their validity of use towards different passes.

Vouchers and discounts cannot be used in conjunction with one another, unless explicitly stated – where a second voucher is applied to an account, the original voucher will be overwritten and its discount will be lost. Vouchers are non-transferrable and have no cash value. Placing a voucher for sale is strictly prohibited and will ensue in the voucher being made void.

To redeem a voucher, you must present the code at checkout, or through the voucher section of ‘My Account’ prior to checkout. Where the voucher, discount or promotion takes the form of bonus credit (including bonus credit received in return for leaving feedback), unless otherwise stated, once added to an account the bonus credit will be valid for 30 days.

## 13\. LEAVING FEEDBACK

We incentivise users to leave feedback for their gym visits. Feedback must be useful, original, and inoffensive to be approved. If it does not meet this criteria, or for any other reason we do not think that it should be made available on the website, PayAsUGym may reject the feedback and this will not count towards your feedback bonus credit. For each 5 pieces of approved feedback, the user will receive £5 bonus credit. This credit will be valid on a user's account for 30 days once applied.

You will be notified via email if your feedback has been rejected, and you will have the opportunity to leave any rejected feedback again.

Feedback will be processed within 3 days of it being left by the user. If it is not showing on the website within this time, it might have been sent to the Partner to request their response. We give partners 3 days to respond to feedback, before it automatically is set to live on the website.

The visits available to leave feedback for will be visible in a user’s account. Feedback can be left for every visit with a Day Pass, and every first, fifth, tenth visit etc per venue with a FitFix 5, FitFix 10 or Monthly Pass.

PayAsUGym reserves the right to change or remove this promotion at any time, without notification.
