# Payroll Services, Payroll Processing Solutions, Payroll Specialist

Paycor, Inc. values your privacy, and is committed to providing exceptional client service and ease of mind that your business, financial and/or personal information is secure. We use reasonable care to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We have created this privacy statement with your privacy and security in mind. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site. This Privacy Statement may be revised from time to time without notice.

## Collecting of Personal Information 

Personal information is only collected when the visitor submits it. Generally, this information is requested when a visitor is asked to register before entering a limited-access site, or when the visitor requests information or contact from Paycor, Inc. The Client is responsible for maintaining correct information required for payroll processing.

## Cookies

In an effort to publish content visitors need and want, Paycor collects summative site-visitation statistics using cookies. A cookie is a piece of data that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. We do not track individuals’ use of the site. 

When an Internet user visits our site, a cookie is placed on the visitor's machine (if the visitor accepts cookies) or is read if the visitor has accessed the site previously. 

We do not use this technology to develop or access personally identifiable information about the visitor; it is a tool we use to compile statistics about our web site usage. We do not share this information outside of Paycor, and do not allow other companies to place technology on our site that would develop personally identifiable information. 

If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the paycor.com web site, you will be able to view the text and graphics in the public web sites only. Limited-access sites require that the visitor's browser accept cookies. 

## External Links

This site contains links to other sites. Paycor is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.  

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We take a number of security precautions to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of our data. These precautions can be grouped as internal security and external security. Both security groups define the individuals or groups who are authorized to access and/or change data. This prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing, copying, editing, or deleting private data. We also implement an audit system that tracks access, both successful and unsuccessful, to confidential data. This audit information is used to constantly evaluate and refine our security measures and to identify individuals who might attempt to inappropriately access data and to take remedial action. 

Paycor uses industry-standard 128-bit secure socket layer (SLL) technology to encrypt and authenticate transactions. SSL creates a secured connection between our web servicers and your browser, which eliminates unauthorized access to transmitted data and ensures data is sent only to the intended server.
