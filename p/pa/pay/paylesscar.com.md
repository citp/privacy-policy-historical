# Car Rentals: Payless Car Rental Privacy Statment

  | 

You understand that the collection of personal data is necessary to rent a car, enter our sweepstakes or become a member of the Payless Passport Club. We respect your privacy and your right to know how that information is being used. The following represents our privacy policy regarding the collection, handling and distribution of your personal data. 

SECURITY:   
Any personal data received by us through our Site is protected and encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We have taken what we believe to be reasonable steps to ensure your personal data is accessible only to those whom we designate. However, unless you notify us otherwise as provided in the Option provision below, your personal information will be shared with our marketing partners and affiliates. This personal information may contain all of the information you have provided to us to make a reservation and rent you a car. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, employer, date of birth, driver's license number, credit card information and your rental history. We gather this information from our Site, from our rental agreements and from our Passport Club membership database. It is shared with our independent franchisees and affiliates that will provide you the car. We also exchange information about our customers with affiliates and marketing partners with whom you may also do business. Once we have accumulated information about you and your traveling profile, we and our marketing partners and affiliates may use that information to develop marketing and promotion programs customized for you. To the extent necessary, this information may be passed to third parties to enforce collection efforts against you as a result of the breach of any agreement with us. 

PERMISSION:   
By accessing this Site or by entering into a rental agreement with us, or with our franchisees or affiliates, you are giving us, our franchisees and our affiliates permission to use, transmit and store your personal information. We also have the right to share this information with third parties with whom we do business subject to the Option Provision. 

OPTION PROVISION:   
If you want us to limit the use of your personal information, please write us at: 

  
Payless Car Rental Systems, Inc.   
Attn: Option Provision   
2350-N 34th Street North   
Suite 140  
St. Petersburg, FL 33713 

If you select the Option Provision, Payless will not share your personal information with anyone other than our franchisees and affiliates who need that information to provide you a rental car. However, you will be targeted for Payless marketing opportunities and we reserve the right to pass this information to third parties to enforce collection efforts against you as a result of the breach of any agreement with us or our franchisees or affiliates.
