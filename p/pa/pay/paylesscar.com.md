# Payless Car Rental - Privacy Policy

**LAST UPDATED:** February 2009

**PLEASE NOTE:** This privacy policy pertains to PaylessCar.com and any sub-directory below it.

**INTRODUCTION:** Customer privacy is very important and taken very seriously with Payless Car Rental.  It is our policy that customer mail or e-mail information will not be shared with 3rd parties except in the case of contracted partnerships for the purposes of providing added benefits to our customers. Credit information will not be shared with any 3rd party.

Understand that the collection of personal data is necessary to rent a car, enter our sweepstakes or become a member of the Payless Perks program. We believe consumer privacy to be very important; and you have the right to know how that information is being used. The following represents our privacy policy regarding the collection, handling and distribution of your personal data. 

**PERMISSION** : By accessing this website or by entering into a rental agreement with us, or with our franchisees or affiliates, you are giving us, our franchisees and our affiliates permission to use, transmit and store your personal information. 

**SECURITY** : Any substantial personal data received by us through our website is protected and encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We have taken what we believe to be reasonable steps to ensure your personal data is accessible only to those whom we designate.   


We collect customer data in two ways:

> **1) While making a reservation at Payless.** The information you send will be kept for our records and for our franchisees and affiliates who need that information to provide you a rental car. This information will not be shared with any third parties or any other Payless companies. 
> 
> **2) When signing up for a Payless promotion or program.** The information you send will only be used for Payless Car Rental promotions (and sister companies), contests, newsletters, and upcoming events/offers. We will never transmit this information to a third party without your express permission. 
> 
> If, after signing up for a Payless contest or promotion, you no longer wish to participate, you may Opt-Out of all future mailings from Payless Car Rental System, Inc.
> 
> [Click here](https://web.archive.org/customer-care/new-rentals.do) to visit the Customer Care page and let us know you'd like to opt-out. 
> 
> Secondly, you may notify us using the “Option Provision” method below, which is a non-electronic version of our Opt-Out system. You may send us a Notification of Removal letter in which, when received by Payless Corporate, we will manually remove your personal information from our promotion database.
> 
> There is one exception to the “Option Provision” and data collection policies mentioned above **. If Payless has determined or been advised that you have used our products/services in furtherance of a crime or in any criminal manner, Payless may release all information to applicable law enforcement agencies in an effort to assist in their investigations.   Payless may also use, or release to third parties, your information as a result of any breach of any agreement between you and Payless.  **

**OPTION PROVISION** : If you want us to limit the use of your personal information, please send us a Notification of Removal letter at: 

Payless Car Rental Systems, Inc.   
Attn: Option Provision   
2350-N 34th Street North   
St. Petersburg , FL 33713 

If you select the Option Provision, Payless will not share your personal information with anyone other than our franchisees and affiliates who need that information to provide you a rental car. However, we reserve the right to pass this information to third parties to enforce collection efforts against you as a result of the breach of any agreement with us, our franchisees, or affiliates (previously discussed under the "Security" section, located above).

**FUTURE POLICY CHANGES:** We reserve the right to make any changes to our Privacy Policy at any time. The changes will be effective upon posting on our website; on this page.
