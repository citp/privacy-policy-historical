### Advertising & Do Not Track Mechanisms

We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests.

We still know the site you were visiting immediately before you came to Payless.com and we will continue to track the parts of our site which you visit, including information about your checkout. However, when you turn on DNT in your browser, we stop collecting information about your recent visits to websites that have integrated our buttons or widgets. We stop collecting the unique browser cookie that links your browser to visits to these websites for tailoring suggestions or ads.
