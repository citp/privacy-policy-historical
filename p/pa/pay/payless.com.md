## How does Payless.com protect my privacy?

We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we limit access to nonpublic customer information only to those employees who need the information to do their jobs. We also inform employees within the Payless ShoeSource family of companies about their responsibility to adhere to our own business ethical standards and confidentiality policies, including the privacy of personal information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

We use SSL (Secure Socket Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by SSL.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Payless.com. To check the security of your connection, look for an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your web browser). This and a change in the first characters of the site address from "http" to "https" alert you that SSL is active.

VeriSign® has issued Payless.com a unique ID, which assures visitors they have reached our authentic site thereby allowing communications to be encrypted for privacy.

**Unauthorized Purchase Protection**

We endeavor to make every transaction you make at Payless.com 100% safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Payless.com.

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Payless.com will cover the entire liability to you, up to the full $50 amount. Payless.com will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Payless.com while using the secure server.
