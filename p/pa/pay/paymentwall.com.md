This information, alone or combined with other information, may allow you to be identified.

Additionally, our customer support team may contact you to request proof of personal identity, such as a picture of a legal identification document, in order to ensure your transaction is valid or to the extent it otherwise may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations as a financial institution.




Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to use our service, and we do not knowingly collect or use any information from children or other individuals legally prohibited from using our website. To the extent you believe we have collected any information from children, please notify us immediately so we can take appropriate measures, including by promptly deleting it to the extent we are permitted to do so by law.

### Data Disclosure

Your data may be disclosed to third parties in any or all of the following circumstances. Because your privacy is important to us, we have taken measures to ensure that all of the entities we share your information with have implemented strong data privacy and data protection practices of a level comparable to that which we employ.

  * **When our affiliates need it to help provide the Paymentwall service:** PW Inc. has several affiliates around the world that assist it in providing the Paymentwall service. We may provide your information to these affiliates for any of the purposes we would ourselves use your information, including carrying out the transaction you requested, preventing fraud or illegal activity, and enforcing our terms and conditions.

  * **When our payment partners need it to process a transaction you initiated:** We have contracts with banks and other third party financial institutions for every payment method we offer on our service. When you authorize a transaction, we will transmit to the relevant third party any information they require to process this transaction. What information is required will vary by payment type, but may include your name, address, and details of the purchase you are attempting to make.

  * **When our merchants need it to process a transaction you initiated:** Where necessary, we will share certain information about you with our third party merchants to help facilitate the transactions. This data will never include your sensitive payment details (such as credit card number).

  * **When other third parties that provide us with services related to the Paymentwall service require it in order to provide the services,** such as our server hosting providers and independent auditors we engage for the purposes of analyzing our compliance with the law or relevant independent standards.

  * **To the extent required by law:** We will share your information with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law. For example, we are required by law to undergo certain routine audits, which may require us to share your information with the third party auditors we have engaged in relation to these requirements. Additionally, we may have to disclose your information when we receive a valid subpoena or other law enforcement request, or when the law requires us to affirmatively notify law enforcement in order to prevent harm or illegal activity. The necessity of all such disclosures will be determined in our sole discretion. For more information on our procedures related to legal requests, please review our law enforcement policy.

  * **To the extent our legitimate business interests require us to do so,** for example by transmitting it to our third party partners for inclusion on their blacklists or lists of terminated merchants, to help us engage in our fraud reduction efforts, to support our corporate governance activities or facilitate the sale or other transfer of all or part of our business, or to protect us or our service.

### Data Retention

We are required to retain many types of your personal information by law, often for a period of several years. We may additionally retain your information for a longer period than is required by law to the extent it is in our legitimate business interests to do so (for instance, we may retain it to prevent fraud on our service) and is not otherwise prohibited by law.

### Data Location

We use servers located in the United States and the European Union to store personal information gathered by the Paymentwall service. Additionally, to the extent we transfer your information to a third party, including our affiliates, as described in this policy, these third parties may be located outside our usual business location and your country of residence. In all such cases, data transfers will be carried out only after we ensure the third party provides comparable levels of data protection and that they will use your information only for the purposes set out in this policy.
