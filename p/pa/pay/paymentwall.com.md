### How We Use Cookies

Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. Cookies are small data files used to recognize Paymentwall, Inc. users, to store user preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site to provide better service when visitors return to our site, help prevent fraud, and to provide trust and safety. Browser settings can be changed to alert you of accepting cookies and will prompt you to accept a cookie or it can disallow cookies. If cookies are disallowed, you may have limited access to Paymentwall’s Services.

### Payments Safety and Security

Paymentwall’s goal is to provide you with a safe and convenient online checkout experience. We always protect the security of your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology for each transmission that encrypts the information you input. All purchases made via a credit card or alternative direct payment must use an SSL-enabled browser. Using SSL-enabled browsers better protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is being transmitted over the Internet. When you enter sensitive information (such as e-wallet account details, mobile number, credit card number or your password) and place an order online, we encrypt that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that is the approved industry standard.

Users can check the security of their internet connection by looking at address bar of your browser window as you place your order online. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". For credit card transactions, we will securely transmit the entire credit card number to be processed by the credit card company. We will only reveal the last 4 digits of your credit card number when printing an order confirmation. For security purposes we do not keep or store your credit card information as it is only used to complete the secure transaction. Your credit card number and other sensitive information will not be stored after the transaction is complete to help protect your credit card information. To further protect against unauthorized access to your account and to your computer, be sure to sign off when finished.
