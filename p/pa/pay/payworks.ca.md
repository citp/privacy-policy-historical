### Collection and Use of Personal Information

Collection of personal information online is designed to protect access to your personal accounts and to assist in providing you with the products and services you want and need.

Employing stringent security measures in the collection of your personal information, all Payworks online account applications are submitted to Payworks' secure administration site through an encrypted direct line to the secure database. Once received by Payworks, only approved personnel may open and process the application. Furthermore, auditing mechanisms have been put into place to further protect your information by identifying which employees have accessed and in any way modified-for example, updated or added to-your personal information.
