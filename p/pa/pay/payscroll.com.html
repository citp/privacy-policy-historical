<h1>PayScroll Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
At PayScroll, we respect the privacy of the users of our website and services and are committed to protecting it. We have created this policy to demonstrate our commitment to you and to help you understand it. This Privacy Policy covers PayScroll.Com's treatment of “Your Profile” information that is collected when you are on the PayScroll.Com site, and when you use PayScroll.Com's services. By using PayScroll, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Commitment. Your information will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States of America. The PayScroll Site contains links to other Web sites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to which you choose to link from our Sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.
</p>
<h3>1. Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<p>
A general visit to PayScroll.com does not require you to reveal any personally identifiable information about yourself. To use some of the features or services that we offer, you may be required to create a PayScroll member account, participate in questionnaires or surveys, or use the QnA section. PayScroll.com allows Members (“Member”) to create individual profiles, which may include personal information (“Your Personal Profile”, “Your Skills Profile”) and professional information (“Your Professional Profile”). The personal information provided as part of your profile will be made public to others, and the professional information will remain anonymous to the others and the general public. The user submitted personally identifiable information collected such as your name, username, email address, zip code, age, gender and employment, education, and current salary information may be used to deliver certain services, products or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site, send you notices for services that you have used or that may be of interest to you, and improve the content and general administration of the Site. We may receive your personally identifiable information from our partners that provide us with third-party services so that we can customize and improve the services that we may provide to you. In addition, non-personally-identifiable information such as IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site are collected. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. 
</p>
<p>
We have areas on the PayScroll.com where you can submit feedback and comments. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes our property, and we can use such feedback or comments for marketing purposes or to contact you for further information. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about PayScroll, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit PayScroll.com. We will not sell or rent the information entered in the “Your Profile” section to third parties for their marketing purposes and will only disclose the information you provide us in accordance with our Privacy Policy and/or with your explicit consent. 
</p>
<h3>2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information </h3>
<p>

PayScroll.com reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of PayScroll.com or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below.
