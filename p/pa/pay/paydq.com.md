# Crescent Systems - Privacy Statement

Crescent Systems is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your customers. 

**Collection of your Personal Information**  
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested such as receiving information about Crescent Systems products and services, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access service, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing, downloading and/or registering Crescent Systems products. The personal information we collect may include your name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information about your job function, information about your company, and credit card information.

The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site. Top of page

**Use of Your Personal Information**  
The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.

In support of these uses, Crescent Systems may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related Crescent Systems products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Crescent Systems, information collected by paydq.com may be combined with information collected by other Crescent Systems services.

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, and only with your permission, we may send you information about other Crescent Systems products and services, and/or share information with Crescent Systems partners so they may send you information about their products and services.

We merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of paydq.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation data.

When you sign up for a newsletter or agree to receive promotional e-mail, paydq.com may use customized links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with your personal information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.

Crescent Systems occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Crescent Systems may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Crescent Systems or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Crescent Systems and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Crescent Systems employees or agents, users of Crescent Systems products or services, or members of the public.

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Crescent Systems or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Crescent Systems abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. Top of page

**Control of Your Personal Information**  
Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Crescent Systems and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. As described below in the next section, you can access your personal information and make choices about how you wish to be contacted.

PayDQ.com may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service you requested, or confirming you requested a product or service. In some services offered by PayDQ.com, contact with the customer is an intrinsic part of the service.

**Security of Your Personal Information**  
Crescent Systems is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and that of your customers. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.
