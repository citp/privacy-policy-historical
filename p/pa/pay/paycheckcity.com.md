# PaycheckCity.com | Privacy Policy

Symmetry Software (SYMMETRY) believes that privacy is important to the success and use of the Internet. This statement sets forth SYMMETRY's Privacy Policy for this website and describes the practices that SYMMETRY will follow with respect to the privacy of users of this site. From time to time, we may change this Privacy Policy. If we ever change our Privacy Policy, SYMMETRY will prominently display a notice of this change on our home page and throughout the website.

**What is personally identifiable information?**  
"Personally identifiable information" is information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number, social security number, and so on. The only personally identifiable information SYMMETRY collects is your name, email, and phone number.

SYMMETRY also collects nonpersonal information that helps us to understand site visitor demographics such as company, size of company, industry, job function, etc. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we routinely review the adequacy of our security procedures.

**How is information collected, used, and disclosed?**  
We do not share or sell your personal information to anyone. We do not give your personal information to anyone outside of SYMMETRY for their promotional or marketing use. We do not collect personally identifiable information unless we first ask you for it during the registration process. If you opt to receive additional information during the registration process, you may get periodic emails from SYMMETRY or our trusted partners. These emails will contain information from companies that offer legitimate products and services typically in the finance, taxation, accounting or payroll related areas. Again, SYMMETRY does not share or sell your personally identifiable information to these companies; we directly manage any email campaigns on behalf of these trusted partners. Finally, you may always unsubscribe from future informational emails if you wish.

Whether you provide any information is entirely up to you. If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy. Also, SYMMETRY may provide aggregate statistics about visitors to our sites, such as volume, traffic patterns, visitor demographics and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information. SYMMETRY may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of Use; or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others.

**What are cookies and how are they used?**  
Some SYMMETRY sites, like many other commercial web sites, may utilize a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a web site operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings of text that web sites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing a SYMMETRY informational site, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site before.

We may also make use of memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the user of certain SYMMETRY web applications. Similarly, we may use cookies so that we can provide information based on preferences you have indicated while using the site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize SYMMETRY services which require registration if you reject cookies.

**What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?**  
If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy. If, at a later time, you do not wish to permit that use, you can delete your registration and personally identifiable information by click on "Personal Information" link located in the yellow bar at the top of the web site. Simply follow the instructions to delete your registration information. You may also [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093841id_/http%3A//www.paycheckcity.com/pages/viewUserData.asp) to modify your Personal Information.

**How can you correct, access, and update your information?**  
If you wish to view and change your personally identifiable information simply use the "Personal Information" link located in the yellow bar at the top of the web site. Simply follow the instructions to modify or delete your registration information. You may also [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093841id_/http%3A//www.paycheckcity.com/pages/viewUserData.asp) to modify your Personal Information.

**How do we protect your information?**  
We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers. Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies. We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.

**How can you help protect your information?**  
If you are using a SYMMETRY web site for which you registered and chose an Access Code, we recommend that you do not divulge your Access Code to anyone. We will never ask you for your Access Code in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer. Other SYMMETRY sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093841id_/http%3A//www.paycheckcity.com/pages/contact.asp).
