	  <p>When you become a PAYlution cardholder,   and in the course of your transactions through PAYlution, you share some of your   important personal information with us. Your privacy is important to us and we   understand the sensitive nature of this information. PAYlution is vigilant in   its efforts to ensure that information about its cardholders is protected. While   your privacy has always been important to us, our new Privacy Policy provides   you with all of the safeguards set forth in the Canadian federal Personal   Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and in other   applicable personal information protection legislation ("Privacy Laws"). Nothing   in this Privacy Policy will limit our rights and obligations pursuant to such   Privacy Laws. <br>

      CONSENT<br>
	  </strong>BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO PAYlution OR ITS   SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AGENTS, YOU AGREE THAT PAYlution AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS   AND AGENTS MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE   WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY PRIVACY LAWS. <br>
        <br>
      Subject   to legal and contractual requirements, you may refuse or withdraw your consent   to certain of the identified purposes at any time by contacting the PAYlution   Privacy Officer. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to   provide you or continue to provide you with certain services or information   which may be of value to you. If you provide PAYlution or its service providers   and agents with personal information of another individual, you represent that   you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents   from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such personal   information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.      <br>
	  <br>
	  </p>
    <p><strong><br>
      WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong><br>
      Personal information means   any information about you except your business title, address, e-mail address,   telephone number or facsimile number.      <br>
	  <br>
    The types of personal information that PAYlution may collect from you from   time to time include: your name, home address, telephone number, personal e-mail   address, your forwarding address (e.g. during a vacation), previous address(es),   billing and account information (such as credit card, or bank account number),   your mailing preferences, delivery instructions, and customer service   preferences. In addition, from time to time, we may ask you to provide us with   more detailed information regarding your interests, occupation and background.   For example, we sometimes ask our customers to complete surveys in order to get   a better sense of who they are and what issues, products or services may be of   interest to our clients.

      <p><strong><br>
      PAYlution's PRIVACY PRINCIPALS</strong><br>
        <br>
      PAYlution collects, uses and   discloses your personal information by employing "fair information practices" as   described in the following privacy principles and embodied in Privacy Laws: <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY:</strong><br>
Accountability for PAYlution's compliance with   this Privacy Policy rests with PAYlution's Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer   may delegate other individuals to act in his or her behalf. PAYlution is   responsible for all personal information under its control. All PAYlution   employees have been advised of their responsibilities under the Personal   Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada) and the Personal   Information Protection Act (British Columbia), but the overall responsibility   for the protection of personal information and compliance with this policy rests   with PAYlution's Privacy Officer. PAYlution is committed to ensuring that the   appropriate security measures are employed in the storage or transfer of   sensitive information. However, in relation to e-mail or wireless communication,   complete confidentiality and security cannot be assured. Remember that e-mail   sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted. We recommend that you use   caution when contacting us via e-mail and that you do not include confidential   information (such as financial institution account numbers) in those messages,   as they are not encrypted. <br>
<br>
<p>PAYlution is not accountable for any damages suffered when a cardholder   transmits personal information through e-mail or wireless communication to   PAYlution or when PAYlution transmits personal information via e-mail or   wireless communication to a client on request.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
        </li><li><strong>IDENTIFYING PURPOSES:</strong><br>
          The purposes for which personal information   is collected shall be identified by PAYlution before or at the time the   information is collected. There are certain specific reasons why PAYlution needs   to collect your personal information:
            <blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>to establish your identity and obtain contact information for you; </li>
                <li>to maintain and provide card services; </li>
                <li>to process transactions; </li>
                <li>to protect you and us from error and fraud; </li>
                <li>to develop and mange our business and operations;              </li>
                <li>to distribute our news letters and other material to individuals on our mail   and e-mail lists, including via third party mailing houses and e-mail service   providers;              </li>
                <li>to understand and respond to your needs and preferences, including to   contact and communicate with you and to conduct surveys, research and   evaluations;              </li>
                <li>to develop, enhance, market, sell or otherwise provide our products and   services;              </li>
                <li>as permitted by, and to comply with, any legal or regulatory requirements or   provisions; and              for any purpose to which you consent. </li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>To ensure the accuracy of your instructions and to monitor the quality of   service, PAYlution may record its telephone calls. If you have concerns about   the recording of your telephone conversations, you should contact us by e-mail   or by regular mail. PAYlution collects, uses, and discloses personal information   only for purposes that are directly related to the processing of transactions,   and that a reasonable person would consider appropriate under those   circumstances.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
            </p>
        </li><li><strong>CONSENT:</strong><br>
        <strong>The knowledge and consent of the individual are   required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except   as provided by law.</strong>
          <p>Your knowledge and consent are required before we may collect, use or release   your personal information to anyone outside of PAYlution, except in special   circumstances. These special circumstances include times when your consent is   deemed given by law or not required by law. These circumstances may include, but   are not limited to, a fraud investigation, an investigation by police, or where   the financial institution from which you transferred funds to PAYlution is   unable to contact you. PAYlution may be compelled to release your information by   a court of law, or by another legal authority, regulatory authority (including   self regulatory authority), or governmental body. In all cases, our policy is to   release information only to the extent that we are required to do so.   
              <br>
              <br>
          </p><p><strong>Your consent can be express or implied:</strong><br>
            By entering your personal   information on PAYlution's website, you are implicitly consenting to the   collection of that information. PAYlution will seek your express consent before   disclosing your information for purposes other than those specified in this   Policy or that a reasonable person would expect, unless such a request would   compromise an investigation.   
              <br>
              <br>
          </p><p><strong>You can withdraw your consent after you have given it:</strong><br>
            An   individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual   restrictions and reasonable notice. To withdraw your consent you must contact   our Privacy Officer, in writing, using the contact information listed in this   Policy. If you do not consent to certain uses of information, or if you withdraw   your consent, PAYlution may not be able to provide you with a particular product   or service or we may not be able to provide service to you at all.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
        </li><li><strong>LIMITING COLLECTION:</strong><br>
          The collection of personal information shall   be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by PAYlution.   The information shall be collected by fair and lawful means. Personal   information shall not be collected indiscriminately. Both the amount and the   type of information collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to   fulfill the purposes identified.     
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </li><li><strong>LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, AND RETENTION:</strong><br>
Personal information   shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which the   information was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as   required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as   necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. <br>
<br>
<p><strong>The information is only used for specific purposes:</strong><br>
          Personal   information will only be used or disclosed for the purpose(s) for which it is   collected. PAYlution will not use personal information for any additional   purpose unless we obtain your consent to do so.          </p>
          <p>PAYlution will not sell personal information to any third party. However, it   may be necessary for PAYlution to disclose your information to the following   third parties:   
 </p><blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Your employer (including authorized staff); </li>
            <li>PAYlution (including those with whom PAYlution has contracted to provide   Card related services; </li>
            <li>third party operators to whom Alterna Bank has outsourced the management of   Card issuing and Cardholder inquiries; </li>
            <li>legal, financial, and professional advisors; and </li>
            <li>governmental agencies. </li>
          </ul>
		  </blockquote>
          <p><strong>Your information is destroyed when it is no longer   needed:</strong><br>
            PAYlution keeps your information only for as long as we need it.   Please note that PAYlution retains your information for a period of five (5)   years after the completion of our services to you in order to assist you and in   reviewing your historical account information when necessary and to enable us to   provide more comprehensive security.     
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
          </p>
        </li><li><strong>ACCURACY:</strong><br>
          Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and   up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used. PAYlution will   make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information is as accurate,   complete and current as required for the purposes for which it was collected. In   many cases, PAYlution relies on its cardholders to ensure that certain   information, such as their address or telephone number, is current, complete and   accurate. You can check your information to verify, update and correct it, and   to have any obsolete information removed. Please make your request in writing to   our Privacy Officer as set out in this Policy. PAYlution will charge a   reasonable fee for accessing your information.     
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </li><li><strong>SAFEGUARDS:</strong><br>
          Security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of   the information shall protect personal information. Security safeguards shall   protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized   access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. The safeguards may include,   for example, the physical security of offices and storage facilities or   electronic security measures such as passwords, encryption, firewalls, and   secure connections. PAYlution is not accountable for any damages suffered when a   customer transmits personal information through e-mail to PAYlution or when   PAYlution transmits personal information via e-mail in response to a request   from the cardholder. Care shall be used in the disposal or destruction of   personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the   information.     
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </li><li><strong>OPENNESS:</strong><br>
          PAYlution is open about the policies and procedures it   uses to protect personal information. Information about those policies and   procedures will be made available either electronically or in written format in   plain language. However, to ensure the integrity of our security procedures and   business methods, PAYlution may refuse to publicly disclose certain information.
          <p>PAYlution will make the following information available:   
		  </p><blockquote>
          <ul>
              <li>The title, e-mail address, and mailing address of the Privacy Officer, and   how an individual may contact the Privacy Officer with respect to complaints or   inquiries   
              </li><li>A description of the type of personal information held by PAYlution   including a general explanation of its use   
              </li><li>Information on how an individual can gain access to the personal information   held by PAYlution by contacting the Privacy Officer, confirming their identity,   and requesting specified information   
              </li><li>An explanation of what personal information is made available to related   organizations <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
		  </blockquote>
        </li><li><strong>INDIVIDUAL ACCESS: </strong><br>
          You have the right to access the personal   information held by PAYlution. Please make any requests for access in writing,   stating as specifically as possible the personal information you are requesting.   Upon request, PAYlution will, within a reasonable time period, tell you what   personal information it has, what it is being used for, and to whom it has been   disclosed, if applicable. Before providing any information to the requestor,   PAYlution must verify the individual's identity. PAYlution may also refuse to   provide access where it would reveal personal information about, or the identity   of, a third party that cannot be severed from the information about the   individual making the request, and in certain other circumstances there needs to   be notification of governmental institutions before release. Access may also be   refused where the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege; where   revealing the information would also reveal information confidential to   PAYlution; where revealing the information could reasonably be expected to   threaten the life, health or security of an individual; if the information was   collected during an investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention   of the laws of Canada or a province on the expectation that the knowledge or   consent of the individual would compromise the availability or accuracy of the   information; where the information was generated in the course of a formal   dispute resolution process; or where access may otherwise be prohibited or   limited at law. In such cases, PAYlution will explain the reasons it will not   provide the requested information.
          <p><strong><br>
          We will respond to your request promptly:</strong>
            <br>
            PAYlution will deal quickly with your request for access, usually responding   to your request within 30 days. If we need to extend the time, or we must refuse   your request, we will tell you why, subject to any legal restrictions and we   will notify you of the new deadline, the reasons for the extension, and of your   right to make a complaint to the relevant privacy commissioner regarding the   extension.   
          </p><p>When an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness   of personal information, PAYlution must amend the information as required.   Depending upon the nature of the information challenged, amendment could involve   the correction, deletion or addition of information. Where appropriate, the   amended information shall be transmitted to third parties having access to the   information in question.   
            <br>
            <br>
          </p><p>When a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the customer, the   substance of the unresolved challenge shall be recorded by PAYlution. When   appropriate, the existence of the unresolved challenge shall be transmitted to   third parties having access to the information in question.   
          </p><p>PAYlution will charge you a reasonable fee for providing access to your   personal information.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
          </p>
        </li><li><strong>COMPLIANCE, COMPLAINTS AND CONTACT INFORMATION:</strong><br>
          An individual   shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above   privacy principles to the Privacy Officer. If you have any questions or   complaints about our privacy policies, or about how PAYlution is living up to   them, let us know right away.
          <p>PAYlution is committed to treating you with the greatest respect and   consideration, and providing the highest level of service. Even so, from time to   time something may go wrong. There may be a misunderstanding, or you may feel   you have been dealt with unjustly. In most cases, bringing this matter to our   attention will resolve a complaint. Whatever the circumstances, resolving the   problem for you is our primary concern.   
            <br>
            <br>
          </p><p>Please contact our Privacy Officer to discuss any privacy issues or concerns   you might have, or to lodge a complaint. Our Privacy Officer can be contacted in   the following ways:
