We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:</p> <p><strong>With other members of the PayPal corporate family:</strong> We may share your Personal Data with members of the PayPal family of entities to, among other things, provide the Services you have requested or authorised; to manage risk; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of PayPal products, Services, and communications.</p> <p><strong>With other companies that provide services to us: </strong>We share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf. &nbsp;These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and services, or provide customer support.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>With other financial institutions:</strong> We share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product. &nbsp;These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.&nbsp;We may also share Personal Data to process transactions, provide you with benefits associated with your eligible cards, and keep your financial information up to date.</p> <p><strong>With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers:&nbsp;</strong>We may share information about you and your Account with the other parties involved in processing your transactions.

The information might include:</p> <ul style="list-style-type:circle;"> <li>Personal Data and Account information necessary to facilitate the transaction;</li> <li>Personal Data to help other participant(s) resolve disputes and detect and prevent fraud; and</li> <li>Anonymous data and performance analytics to help merchants better understand the uses of our Services and to help merchants enhance Users’ experiences.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong>With other third parties for our business purposes or as</strong> <strong>permitted or</strong><strong> required by law: </strong>We may share information about you with other parties for PayPal’s business purposes or as permitted or required by law, including:</p> <ul style="list-style-type:circle;"> <li>if we need to do so to comply with a law, legal process or regulations;</li> <li>to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, a court order or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or PayPal’s corporate family;</li> <li>if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;</li> <li>to protect the vital interests of a person;</li> <li>with credit agencies and data processors for credit reference checks and anti-fraud and compliance purposes;</li> <li>to investigate violations of or enforce a user agreement or other legal terms applicable to any Service;</li> <li>to protect our property, Services and legal rights;</li> <li>to facilitate a purchase or sale of all or part of PayPal’s business;</li> <li>in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using a Service;</li> <li>to help assess and manage risk and prevent fraud against us, our Users and fraud involving our Sites or use of our Services, including fraud that occurs at or involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals, and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.;</li> <li>to banking partners as required by card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants;</li> <li>to credit reporting and collection agencies;</li> <li>to companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by; and</li> <li>to support our audit, compliance, and corporate governance functions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>With your consent: We also will share your Personal Data and other information with your consent or direction, including if you authorise an account connection with a third-party account or platform.</strong></p> <p><strong>In addition, PayPal may provide aggregated statistical data to third-parties, including other businesses and members of the public, about how, when, and why Users visit our Sites and use our Services.&nbsp; This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.</strong> &nbsp;<strong>We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.</strong></p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6.&nbsp;How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?<strong>&nbsp; </strong></h3> <p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorise or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp; When you authorise such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp; Examples of account connections include:</p> <ul> <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li> <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li> <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp; For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp; If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.&nbsp; We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp; Before authorising an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that you authorised to have an account connection that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp; For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;</p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>7.&nbsp;International transfers</h3> <p>Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.&nbsp; These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection.&nbsp; We have taken specific steps, in accordance with EEA data protection law, to protect your Personal Data.&nbsp; In particular, for transfers of your Personal Data within PayPal related companies,&nbsp;we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities (available <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/bcr">here</a>).&nbsp; Other transfers may be based on contractual protections.&nbsp; Please contact us for more information about this.</p> <p>If you make transactions with parties outside the EEA or Switzerland or connect our Service with platforms, such as social media, outside the EEA or Switzerland, we are required to transfer your Personal Data with those parties in order to provide the requested Service to you.</p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3><a id="8" name="8"></a>8.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp;</h3> <p>When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognise you as a User and to customise your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising;

This is why, unlike the vast majority of providers of internet-based services or financial services in the EU, PayPal has listed in this Privacy Statement the third party service providers and business partners to whom we may disclose your data, together with the purpose of disclosure and type of information disclosed. You will find a link to those third parties <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list"><strong>here</strong></a>.&nbsp; By accepting this Privacy Statement and maintaining an account with PayPal, you expressly consent to the transfer of your data to those third parties for the purposes listed.</p> <p>PayPal may update the list of third parties referred to above every quarter (January 1st, April 1st, July 1st and October 1st). PayPal will only start transferring any data to any of the new entities or for the new purposes or data types indicated in each update after 30 days from the date when that list is made public through this Privacy Statement. You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new data disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your account and stop using our services.</p> <p>In order to provide the PayPal Services, certain of the information we collect (as set out in this Privacy Statement) may be required to be transferred to other PayPal related companies or other entities, including those referred to in this section in their capacity as payment providers, payment processors or account holders (or similar capacities).&nbsp; You acknowledge that according to their local legislation, such entities may be subject to laws, regulations, inquiries, investigations, or orders which may require the disclosure of information to the relevant authorities of the relevant country. Your use of the PayPal Services constitutes your consent to our transfer of such information to provide you the PayPal Services.</p> <p>Specifically, you consent to and direct PayPal to do any and all of the following with your information:</p> <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> <li> <p>Disclose necessary information to: the police and other law enforcement agencies; security forces; competent governmental, intergovernmental or supranational bodies; competent agencies, departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or organisations (including, without limitation, the Agencies referenced in the “Agencies” section of the Third Party Provider List <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list">here</a>) and other third parties, including PayPal Group companies, that (i) we are legally compelled and permitted to comply with, including but without limitation the Luxembourg laws of 24 July 2015 on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA Law”) and 18 December 2015 on the OECD common reporting standard (“CRS Law”); (ii) we have reason to believe it is appropriate for us to cooperate with in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity or potential illegal activity, or (iii) to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement (including without limitation, your funding source or credit or debit card provider).<br> <br> If you are covered by the FATCA or CRS Law, we are required to give you notice of the information about you that we may transfer to various authorities.

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorise or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp; When you authorise such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp; Examples of account connections include:</p> <ul> <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li> <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li> <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp; For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp; If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.&nbsp; We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp; Before authorising an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that you authorised to have an account connection that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp; For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;</p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>7.&nbsp;International transfers</h3> <p>Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.&nbsp; These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection.&nbsp; We have taken specific steps, in accordance with EEA data protection law, to protect your Personal Data.&nbsp; In particular, for transfers of your Personal Data within PayPal related companies,&nbsp;we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities (available <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/bcr">here</a>).&nbsp; Other transfers may be based on contractual protections.&nbsp; Please contact us for more information about this.</p> <p>If you make transactions with parties outside the EEA or Switzerland or connect our Service with platforms, such as social media, outside the EEA or Switzerland, we are required to transfer your Personal Data with those parties in order to provide the requested Service to you.</p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3><a id="8" name="8"></a>8.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp;</h3> <p>When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognise you as a User and to customise your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising;

You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new data disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement.

We also set out in the list of third parties, under each " Category", non-exclusive examples of the actual third parties (which may include their assigns and successors) to whom we currently disclose your Account Information or to whom we may consider disclosing your Account Information, together with the purpose of doing so, and the actual information we disclose (except as explicitly stated, these third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information was shared).</p> </li> <li> <p>Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).</p> </li> <li> <p>Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in Manchester. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personal information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Share necessary Account Information with unaffiliated third parties (listed <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list">here</a>) for their use for the following purposes:</p> <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;"> <li> <p>Fraud Prevention and Risk Management: to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk. For example, if you use the PayPal Services to buy or sell goods using eBay Inc, or its affiliates (“eBay”), we may share Account Information with eBay in order to help protect your accounts from fraudulent activity, alert you if we detect such fraudulent activity on your accounts, or evaluate credit risk.<br> <br> As part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we also may share necessary Account Information with eBay in cases where PayPal has placed a hold or other restriction on your account based on disputes, claims, chargebacks or other scenarios regarding the sale or purchase of goods. Also, as part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we may share Account Information with eBay to enable them to operate their programmes for evaluating buyers or sellers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer Service: for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).</p> </li> <li> <p>Shipping: in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using PayPal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Legal Compliance: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Service Providers: to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><u><a id="18" name="18"></a></u>Credit Reference Agencies Information Notice</h3> <p>If you choose to apply for PayPal Credit, in order to process your application, we will supply your personal information to credit reference agencies (CRAs) and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history.
