# Privacy :PaySimple

This Privacy Policy applies to our collection of information from visitors of the PaySimple.com website, the PaySimple.biz website, and registered customers of PaySimple. 

#####  Collection of Personally Identifiable Information:

We collect personally identifiable information from you when you set up an account with PaySimple.  You do not need to set up an account in order to view the PaySimple.com website, but you must be registered to use the PaySimple payment processing application.

PaySimple does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit personally identifiable information (names, address, phone numbers, etc.) submitted by non-registered users to any other persons or companies. 

Although we currently do not have a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may in the future.  You hereby agree that we may share some or all of the personally identifiable information of non-registered users with these Affiliates.  We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy.

We may use contact information from non-registered users to send promotional products and information about PaySimple and/or on behalf of our partner companies.   
We may provide your personally identifiable information to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services and to help us communicate with you.  However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (except to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this policy).

If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the personally identifiable information collected by us.

#####  Registered PaySimple Account Holders:

Our site requires you to give us contact information (name, address, phone number, and e-mail address) and billing information. We use your contact information to verify your identity, send you messages about your transaction or our company. We use your billing and financial information (bank account numbers) to facilitate payments through the PaySimple system and collect fees if applicable. Personally identifiable information submitted as part of the application process for a PaySimple account and for third party ACH and Credit Card merchant accounts is shared with the merchant account provider solely for the purpose of underwriting and subsequent transaction processing, billing, and account maintenance.

#####  Use of Demographic and Profile Data:

In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyze demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our website. We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address, along with cookies, are used to help identify you and gather basic information. We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in -- and to display content according to your preferences. We sometimes use contact data from our surveys to send you information about our company and/or promotional material on behalf of our partners.

We may create anonymous records from personally identifiable information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you or one of your customers.  We may use this anonymous information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance our services, and we reserve the right to use, and disclose anonymous information to third parties, in our discretion.

We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential lawsuits or suspected fraudulent activity, (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures may potentially mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights.
