# Privacy - PaySimple

**_Last Modified: December 1, 2018_**

This Privacy Policy (“ **Policy** ”) discloses the privacy practices for [www.paysimple.com](http://www.paysimple.com/) and [www.mypaysimple.com](http://www.mypaysimple.com/) (including all sub-domains, the **"Sites"** ), which are owned and operated by PaySimple, Inc. ( **"PaySimple," "our," "we"** or **"us"** ) as well as the use of any mobile device application created by PaySimple (each, the "Mobile App") and our web-based payment application and API (collectively, the “Web App”). The Sites, Mobile App, and Web App may be referred to as our “ **Services**.” The online stores, payment pages, and customer portals hosted on mypaysimple.com on behalf of PaySimple merchants, and the payments iFrame integrated into third party payment pages may be collectively referred to as our “ **Direct Payment Services**.”

This Privacy Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your Personal Information—whether you are a merchant utilizing our Services, a customer of merchant utilizing our Services and/or Direct Payment Services, a user of any free PaySimple Services, or a visitor to the Sites.

By using any of PaySimple’s Services or by dealing with a merchant using PaySimple’s Services or Direct Payment Services, you warrant and represent that you accept the data practices and terms detailed in this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, our [Terms of Service](https://paysimple.com/terms.html) and [Buyer Terms](https://paysimple.com/customer_terms.html). If you do not agree with this Policy, please discontinue your access or use of the Sites, Services, and/or Direct Payment Services immediately.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not address the privacy practices of third parties, including those who incorporate our Services or Direct Payment Services into their own websites and including those with whom we may share information as set forth below. Please review the privacy policies of any third parties before you disclose information to them. **Through your use of any of our Sites, Services, or Direct Payment Services, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

## **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice to you. Changes may apply to any Personal Information we already hold about you and any new Personal Information collected after the Policy is modified. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Modified” date at the top of this Policy, which will always be at [paysimple.com/privacy.html](https://paysimple.com/privacy.html). By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

In addition, we may provide you with “just-in-time” disclosures or additional information about the data handling practices of specific parts of our Sites, Services or Direct Payment Services. Such notices may supplement this Policy or provide you with additional choices about how we process your Personal Information.

## **Our Relationship to You**

To understand PaySimple’s data protection obligations and your rights to your Personal Information under this Policy, it is important that you identify which relationship(s) you have with PaySimple.

(Authorized users of a Merchant’s PaySimple paid, free, and/or demo account are collectively and individually referred to as “Merchants.”)
  * “ **End Customers** ” refers to individuals doing business with a Merchant utilizing PaySimple Services and/or Direct Payment Services. If you are an End Customer, PaySimple will collect your Personal Information solely on behalf of a Merchant.

## **Collection and Use of Personal Information**

For purposes of this policy, **“Personal Information”** refers to any information about an identified or identifiable individual, including financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), and any device information that may be linked with an identifiable individual.

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie this information to Personal Information about you that we collect from other sources or that you provide to us. It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information. While we will make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still exists. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected your Personal Information, please notify us at [privacy@paysimple.com](mailto:privacy@paysimple.com)

We may use analytics services that use cookies, javascript and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Sites, Services, and Direct Payment Services. The information generated by these services about your use of the Sites and/or Services/Direct Payment Services (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their servers. Those service providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your and other users', use of the Sites, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.

For example, in our email programs, PaySimple employs some tracking methods (e.g. "targeting, performance, and functionality cookies"). We track "opens" via a tracking pixel in the email- meaning we track who opens our e-mail messages and when you open our e-mail messages; and we track "clicks" via encoded URLs-meaning we track whether you click on the links contained in our e-mail messages.

Additionally, we use Google Analytics on our Sites and in conjunction with our Services and Direct Payment Services. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect anonymous traffic data to help us analyze how users use the website. The information generated by a cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on Site activity for us and providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. By using the Sites, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit allaboutcookies.org. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit the Google [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en) page. Alternatively, you can opt out of certain pieces by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on. If you wish to take steps to opt-out of tracking by certain online advertisers, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. You may control Facebook’s use of interest-based ads through your Facebook account settings, or may visit the customer support page [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892).

Please note that because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “Do Not Track” signals, we do not alter our data collection and usage practices when we detect such a signal from your browser. Further, due to differences in international laws regarding use of cookies, when the system identifies an IP address originating from outside North America accessing a Direct Payment Services page on the *.mypaysimple.com domain it will not deploy any third-party or marketing- related cookies.

## **Third-Party Integrated Services**

PaySimple provides the ability to integrate the Services with select third party accounting and marketing systems (“Integrated Service(s)”). When a Merchant elects to establish a PaySimple connection with an Integrated Service, all data in your account may be shared with the Integrated Service including personally identifiable information about your consumer and non-consumer customers and prospects. PaySimple does not control the policies or procedures of these Integrated Services, even though the integrations are provided through our Services, and PaySimple is not responsible for and has no control over how these third party Integrated Services function.

This Policy does not cover the collection or use of information, including consumer End Customer data, by Integrated Services, and Merchants acknowledge that use and access to these Integrated Services is solely at their own risk; and Merchants should consult the Terms and Privacy Policy for any Integrated Services accessed via a PaySimple account to determine how they store, process, transmit, and otherwise utilize and protect personally identifiable information and the personally identifiable information Merchants provide about their customers, prospects, and other consumers. Merchants ultimately can control which Integrated Services they choose to use with their PaySimple account, and are responsible for making sure that they do so in compliance with relevant privacy and data protection requirements.

PaySimple may provide the Personal Information we have collected from and/or about Merchants to Integrated Services for the purpose of enabling them to market their products or services to you, if you have not opted out of these disclosures.

## **How we Share Information with Third Parties**

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with any request or consent you provide, PaySimple does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit Personal Information (names, address, phone numbers, financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), etc.) submitted by non-registered users to any other persons or companies. We reserve the right, however, to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties, at our discretion. Except as limited below, third parties may use information we share with them for any purpose for which we may use such information.

Personal information we collect may be shared with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, including but not limited to, identity verification, credit checks, fraud prevention, business intelligence, customer relationship management, bill collection, payment processing, marketing, hosting, and other common technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our sharing with these parties by using our Services and/or Direct Payment Services and accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may provide information, including Personal Information of registered users to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services, to help us communicate with you, or to provide Merchants with ancillary services offered by such service providers and referral partners. We may also receive information about you, including Personal Information, from our third party service providers and referral partners. However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (except to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this Privacy Policy).

If you make a purchase from a Merchant using our Direct Payment Services, we may grant access to or share with the Merchant any and all information we collect as part of that transaction, including credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), except where that disclosure is prohibited by law, regulation or other obligations.

You hereby agree that we may share some or all of your Personal Information with a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, "Affiliates"). We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy. If our company or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, any personal or other information we possess may be a part of the assets transferred, and that company will possess any rights granted to us under this Privacy Policy.

Finally, in extraordinary circumstances, we may share any personal or other information we possess, including but not limited to credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI) when necessary or appropriate to: comply with the law; cooperate with law enforcement or national security requirements; respond to lawful requests; comply with law or credit card rules; participate in a lawful federal, state or local government investigation; protect the rights of PaySimple, other PaySimple Merchants or customers, and third parties; or to investigate violations of or to enforce our [Terms of Service](https://paysimple.com/terms.html), [Buyer Terms](https://paysimple.com/customer_terms.html) or [Acceptable Use Policy](https://paysimple.com/aup.html). However, in doing so, we may: (i) dispute demands for release to the extent we believe, in our sole discretion, are unwarranted, illegitimate or overbroad; and (ii) when we determine that it is necessary or appropriate, we will notify you of any requests for release.

In all cases where we share Personal Information with third parties, we will use a "minimum necessary" standard to disclose only that information required to perform the service for which the information is disclosed.

## **Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information**

We will retain Personal Information for as long as you remain an active use of our Services (e.g., PaySimple Paid Account Holder, Mobile App user, PaySimple Free Account user, etc.) and for a reasonable time thereafter, to serve the purpose(s) for which your Personal Information was processed, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements to the extent permitted by law. We generally apply the retention periods noted below.

  * **End Customer Personal Information** : We may store on behalf of Merchants, for as long as a valid business reason exists, which may be indefinitely, any Personal Information, including but not limited to credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), collected about a consumer or other individual, whether entered directly into our systems by the End Customer via our Direct Payment Services, or whether entered by an authorized Merchant via the Services.

Note that Merchants control any consumer data we collect and process on their behalf, whether that Personal Information is entered by a consumer End Customer via the Direct Payment Services or whether it is entered by a Merchant via the Services, and it is up to the Merchant to determine how long they will store their customers' Personal Information in our systems.

  * **Your Interactions on Our Services:** We may store any information about your interactions on our Sites, Services or Direct Payment Services or any content created, posted or shared by you on our Sites, Services, or Direct Payment Services (e.g., pictures, comments, support tickets, and other content) for a period of time after the closure your account, which may be indefinitely, where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as to maintain the integrity of our systems and logs, for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
  * **Marketing:** We store information used for marketing purposes indefinitely until you unsubscribe. Once you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we add your contact information to our suppression list to ensure we respect your unsubscribe request.
  * **Anonymized and Aggregate Data** : We may retain anonymized and aggregate data indefinitely.



Upon termination of a contract with a Covered Entity, we will remove any ePHI stored in our systems on behalf of that Covered Entity where required by applicable law or the Business Associate Agreement with the Covered Entity; any PHI that we continue to maintain, will be stored and protected per the terms of our Business Associate Agreement with the Covered Entity.

## **Security**

PaySimple has security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, as described in our [security page](https://paysimple.com/security.html). We protect your Personal Information by maintaining physical, technical and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information. Such safeguards include use of secured socket layers (“SSL”), firewalls, data encryption, enforcing physical access controls to our buildings and files, and limiting access to Personal Information only to those employees, agents or third parties who need to know that information in order to process it for us. We are also a Level 1 PCI-DSS certified service provider.

However, you are also responsible for keeping your Personal Information confidential and secure. PaySimple cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will be 100% safe while using its Services and Direct Payment Services. You should choose a password that is complex (e.g., special characters and numbers, sufficient length, etc.) and keep your password confidential. Do not leave your device unlocked so that other individuals may access your device or account. PaySimple is not in control of your Internet or wireless connection or the devices you use to log into the Services, so you should make sure you trust the devices and connections you use to access the Services. If you believe that you have experienced unauthorized access or use of your account, please contact us immediately at [care@paysimple.com](mailto:care@paysimple.com).

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via our Sites or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites or the Services/Direct Payment Services.

## **Choice/Opt-Out**

You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the opt-out instructions we include in such communications. Any communications from us that are not Service-related or transactional in nature will offer you an "unsubscribe" option so that you can opt out of receiving such messages.

You may opt-out of all of our information collection from your mobile device by uninstalling the Mobile App. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

To the extent required by law, you may choose to opt out of sharing with any other parties with whom we may share your Personal Information; however, you may be unable to use the Services or certain features if you wish to limit such sharing.  


## **Accessing, Correcting and Deleting your Information**

PaySimple acknowledges the right of individuals to access their Personal Information. Note that PaySimple will require you to verify your identity prior to releasing any Personal Information.

Generally, you may access, correct, and/or delete your Personal Information as follows:

  * Merchants may access and modify Personal Information and other account information using the account settings page. You may also access, change and modify information previously provided or collected by sending an email to PaySimple at privacy@paysimple.com to initiate changes or modifications or to obtain a file for review. 
  * Merchants may close their PaySimple account by contacting PaySimple Customer Care at 800-466-0992 or [care@paysimple.com](mailto:care@paysimple.com).
  * Merchants may request that their Personal Information be removed from all PaySimple systems. To have any Personal Information permanently deleted from PaySimple systems, you must make an official request in writing by emailing privacy@paysimple.com and include the specific information that you would like permanently deleted from PaySimple systems. Note that if you request removal of your Personal Information you will no longer have access to any existing PaySimple account and will not be able to use any PaySimple product or service. PaySimple reserves the right to retain certain account information for its recordkeeping or compliance purposes.
  * Visitors and any other individuals who have submitted Personal Information directly to PaySimple via the Sites may request that their Personal Information be removed from all PaySimple systems once per year. To have your Personal Information permanently deleted from PaySimple systems, you must make an official request in writing by emailing privacy@paysimple.com and include specific information that you would like permanently deleted from PaySimple systems. PaySimple reserves the right to retain certain account information for its recordkeeping or compliance purposes.
  * End Customers and other consumers who do business with Merchants utilizing PaySimple Services can request that the Merchant provide you with access to the Personal Information PaySimple stores on its behalf, that it make changes to that Personal Information, and/or that the Personal Information be deleted from PaySimple systems. PaySimple cannot honor such requests directly from End Customers, but will assist Merchants with honoring them.
  * If you are a patient, customer, or otherwise do business with a Covered Entity that utilizes PaySimple systems as part of providing service to you, you can request that the Covered Entity provide you with access to the Personal Health Information (PHI/ePHI) stored in PaySimple systems on its behalf, that it make changes to that ePHI, and/or that the ePHI be deleted from PaySimple systems. PaySimple cannot honor such requests directly from End Customers, but will assist Merchants with honoring them.



Note that use of the system delete function by a Merchant to remove any data related to customers (such deleting a Customer Record or deleting a credit card or bank account from a Customer Record), or to remove any personal data about your company or its authorized users (such as deleting a Staff profile), only restricts viewing that data from any system interface and prevents utilizing that data for any system function. It does not permanently delete the data from PaySimple systems. To have any personal data permanently deleted from PaySimple systems, you must make an official request in writing, to the address provided below or by emailing [privacy@paysimple.com](mailto:privacy@paysimple.com), that includes the specific information that you would like permanently deleted from PaySimple systems. Note that PaySimple will require you to verify your identity prior to executing any request to permanently delete data.

If you have any questions about your Personal Information or this policy, or if you would like to make a complaint about how PaySimple processes your personal data, please contact PaySimple by email at [privacy@paysimple.com](mailto:privacy@paysimple.com), or by using the contact details below.

## **Rights for Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)**

PaySimple only provides Services to United States based Merchants. However these Merchants may utilize our Services and deploy our Direct Payment Services such that they are collecting information from EEA residents. In such cases PaySimple is acting as a data processor and storing Personal Information on behalf of these Merchants. Thus if you are located in the EEA and utilize our Direct Payment Services, your Personal Information is processed by PaySimple and transferred to our servers and the servers of our service providers located in the United States. In order to ensure that your information is protected when transferred out of the EEA, PaySimple relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (described in more detail above), as well as inter-company agreements between our various third party service providers that may process your information on behalf of PaySimple, Inc.

If you are located in the EEA, you have certain rights under European law with respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, or object to certain uses of your personal data. You can learn more about these rights from [www.knowyourprivacyrights.org](http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org/).

If you are a Merchant using or a Visitor to PaySimple Sites and/or Services and wish to exercise these rights, please reach out to us using the contact information below. If you are a customer or End Customer of a Merchant who uses PaySimple’s platform and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Merchants you interacted with directly -- we serve as a processor on their behalf, and can only forward your request to them to allow them to respond.

If you are unhappy with the response that you receive from us we hope that you would contact us to resolve the issue but you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority in your jurisdiction at any time.

Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, note that we are generally processing your information on behalf of a Merchant in order to fulfill contracts they might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Direct Payment Services), unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation. In particular we process your personal data to pursue the following legitimate interests, either for ourselves, our merchants, or other third parties (including our merchants’ customers):

  * To provide Merchants, End Customers and others with our services and applications;
  * To prevent risk and fraud on our platform;
  * To provide communications on behalf of Merchants;
  * To provide reporting and analytics;
  * To help Merchants find and integrate with Integrate Services;
  * To provide troubleshooting, support services, or to answer questions;
  * To test out features or additional services; and
  * To improve our services, applications, and websites.



When we process Personal Information to pursue these legitimate interests, we do so where we believe the nature of the processing, the information being processed, and the technical and organizational measures employed to protect that information can help mitigate the risks to the data subject. However, though we undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, PaySimple cannot be responsible for ensuring the security, accuracy, or privacy of your data once it leaves our environments (as directed by Merchants utilizing the Services).
