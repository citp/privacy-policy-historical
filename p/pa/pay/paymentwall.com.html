<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Welcome to PW Inc. (www.paymentwall.com). This policy covers how PW Inc. protects and uses the collected information about the user. PW Inc. protects the privacy of all users who visit or use our Service (collectively or individually, "you" or "Users").</p>
<p>The purpose of the Privacy Policy informs you about the information we collect, share and protect when you visit or use the PW Inc. payment platform (the “Service”). By using the Service you express your agreement with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all personally identifiable information collected on the website where this Privacy Policy is posted. You must be at least 18 years of age to use the PW Inc. service. Please note if the user is under the age of 18, the user must get consent of a parent or legal guardian to access the Service. PW Inc. does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18 years. If PW Inc. learns that personally identifiable information of those under the age of 18 years has been collected on our website or through our Service, then PW Inc. will take the appropriate action to delete the information.</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>When opening a PW Inc. account, we will collect the users contact information including - your name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, and other similar information. This information can be reviewed and edited at any time by logging into your account and clicking on "My Settings" found under the "My Account" tab.</p>
<p>You can close your account through the Service or on the PW Inc. website by editing your PW Inc. Account information. If you close your PW Inc. account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed". Your account information will remain in our database. This information will not be sold or rented to any third parties.</p>
<p>Standard web information is collected when you visit the PW Inc. website or access the Service. The information is sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Internet and contains your IP address, operating system, and standard web log information such as your browser type, sites you visited featuring the Service, and the pages you access on our website.</p>
<p>Additional user information is collected from third party payment service providers, the website by which you access our Service and when you contact our support team. PW Inc. uses user information to provide additional features found on the Service. PW Inc. aggregates user information on what pages users access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer (such as surveys and/or site registrations), digital goods purchases, name, address, limited payment information (e.g., partial credit card information), to allow PW Inc. to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
<p>User information is also used to deliver relevant advertisements to each user. We have relationships with ad servers to place ads on our web pages and our platform. The ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, IP address, and clickstream information but not limited to those. We do not have control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. You can consult the privacy policy of these other sites to learn how your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>PW Inc. processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
<h3>Personal Information Privacy</h3>
<p>The term “personal information” is used to describe the information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a single person or can be used with other sources to uniquely identify a single individual.</p>
<p>We will not share your personal information with third parties unless we believe in good faith that:</p>
<p>(I) such information is permitted being subject to access, use, preservation or disclosure to reasonably and necessarily satisfy any applicable law, regulation or legal process.</p>
<p>(II) such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Use for the Service.</p>
<p>(III) such action assists in detecting, preventing and, vice versa, addressing fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Service.</p>
<p>(IV) such action is appropriate to protect the rights and property as well as encourage safety of Paymentwall, its employees, users of the Service and others.</p>
<p>Customers may prevent their information from being used by other services by e-mailing or mailing PW Inc. a letter to the address below. We respect each request and will provide site visitors a description of information that we maintain about them.</p>
<h3>Protection of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>PW Inc. has taken appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural security measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of the information that we have collected from you at our site or through the Service.</p>
<h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. Cookies are small data files used to recognize PW Inc. users, to store user preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site to provide better service when visitors return to our site, help prevent fraud, and to provide trust and safety. Browser settings can be changed to alert you of accepting cookies and will prompt you to accept a cookie or it can disallow cookies. If cookies are disallowed, you may have limited access to Paymentwall’s Services.</p>
<h3>Payments Safety and Security</h3>
<p>Paymentwall’s goal is to provide you with a safe and convenient online checkout experience. We always protect the security of your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology for each transmission that encrypts the information you input. All purchases made via a credit card or alternative direct payment must use an SSL-enabled browser. Using SSL-enabled browsers better protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is being transmitted over the Internet. When you enter sensitive information (such as e-wallet account details, mobile number, credit card number or your password) and place an order online, we encrypt that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that is the approved industry standard.</p>
<p>Users can check the security of their internet connection by looking at address bar of your browser window as you place your order online. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". For credit card transactions, we will securely transmit the entire credit card number to be processed by the credit card company. We will only reveal the last 4 digits of your credit card number when printing an order confirmation. For security purposes we do not keep or store your credit card information as it is only used to complete the secure transaction. Your credit card number and other sensitive information will not be stored after the transaction is complete to help protect your credit card information. To further protect against unauthorized access to your account and to your computer, be sure to sign off when finished.</p>
<h3>Unsolicited e-mails</h3>
<p>PW Inc. does not send unsolicited e-mails to private addresses or to anyone who has asked to remove from all PW Inc. email lists. Any newsletters that we send are only sent to those who have subscribed to them. To stop receiving e-mails or newsletters from Paymentwall, click on the unsubscribe link in the e-mail or newsletter.</p>
<h3>PW Inc. User Info</h3>
<p>PW Inc. does not and will not, at any time, request your full credit card information, your account ID and password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited email or through telephone communication. Please never disclose your passwords for any reason.</p>
<p>If you feel that this site is not following the above policy or you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you may contact us at the details below:</p>
