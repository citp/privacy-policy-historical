## Papirus Web Site Privacy Policy

### Effective Date of Current Policy: May 28, 2012

Simply Good Software, Inc. (“SGS”, or “we” or “us”) operates the website located at [papirus.net](https://papirus.net/) (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect through our Site and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at . This Privacy Policy applies to the services and products offered by SGS, as well as any other applications, content or features that we may from time to time offer on the Site.

The privacy of our members is very important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy before using the Site or submitting any personal information. By using the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

#### Personal information we collect

We collect information from you when you register on our Site. The types of personal information you provide to us may include contact information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords.

If you choose to invite another person to join our Site, we will ask you for the invitee’s e-mail address and automatically send him or her a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to register at the Site on your behalf, using your name. We use and store this information only for the purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

You may also choose to submit information about third parties by uploading your address book, which may include names, e-mail addresses, addresses, and other personal information of your contacts. If you give us your password to automatically export this data, we will not store your password after you have uploaded your contacts’ information.

We publish your name, your title and your organization name in a public directory where other user users can find it and request a contact from you. Only if you approve a contact request your name will be added to user's address book, and his name will be added to your address book. At any point of time you can delete previously approved contact from your address book. You may also elect to withdraw from having your information published for the other users to see by changing your privacy setting.

We also publish your name and contact information in your local organization's directory. Your name is visible to members of your organization. You can provide your contact information (phone numbers and Skype/IM ids) and add it to your profile. This information will be visible to any member in your organization. In addition your organization members can change this information to fix typos and incorrect or obsolete information. You cannot elect to withdraw from having your name and contact information within local organization's directory.

Your contact information cannot be visible by the other users who are not members of your organization without your permission.

If any user from your address book adds you to a shared project, your name will become visible to any member of this project. At any point of time you can exit such project.

If any user from your address book adds you to a restricted project, your name will become visible to any administrator of such a project. At any point of time you can exit such project.

#### Non-personal information we collect

**Log Files**

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the browser you used to visit our web Site, the time you visited our Site and which pages you visited throughout our Site.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our Site. (Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information). This allows us, among other things, to identify our members so they do not have to re-enter their user id or password.

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our Site as well as other sites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.

#### What we use your information for

The information we collect to understand your needs and interests helps us deliver a consistent and personalized experience. For example, we may use your information to:

  * create and maintain your account
  * prevent and detect fraud or other malicious activity;
  * communicate with you about our services and features;
  * allow other members to communicate with you;
  * provide service and support;
  * update you on new services and features



We will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.

#### Children`s Privacy

We are in compliance with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and do not target our Site to children under 13, or knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our Site.

#### How we protect your information

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, we utilize appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect, including encryption of passwords stored on our servers. Additionally, we only support HTTPS (ciphered) protocols for access to our Site.

Although we try our best to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, please be aware that there are risks inherent in sharing information and that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other members with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on our Site will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on our Site. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.

#### Discloser of your information to third parties

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may disclose your information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.

We may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our members, traffic patterns, and related Site information. This data reflects Site usage patterns gathered during customer visits to our Site each month but does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member, unless that member has given us permission to share that information. We may also provide log files and other databases of user information to third parties for analysis, so we can get a better understanding of traffic through our Site.

We also use third party advertisements on the Site to support our Site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our Site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our Site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking Sites).

If the ownership of all or substantially all of our company changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.

#### Access and accuracy of your information

We strive to keep your personal information accurately recorded. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to help maintain data accuracy. We provide our members with reasonable access to personal information that they provided to us and the reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for its deletion, as applicable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.

To view and change the personal information that you directly provided to us you can access “My Profile” page and follow the instructions on that page. If you want to stop using your account you can delete it by contacting us at the address listed below.

Please be aware that even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of some or all of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others (for instance any comments or other posts you had made on our Site).

#### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent (subject to the exceptions set forth in the Section entitled Disclosure of your information to third parties, above).
