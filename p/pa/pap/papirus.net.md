# Privacy Policy - Pyrus

### Effective Date of Current Policy: June 14, 2019

Simply Good Software, Inc. (“Company”, or “we” or “us”) operates the website located at [pyrus.com](https://pyrus.com/) (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to those (the “Subscriber(s)” or “you” or “yours”, as applicable) who visit the Site, download any downloadable software, install any mobile applications, and/or use the Company’s products (collectively, the “Service”).

For purposes of this Policy, personal data shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This might be by reference to an identifier such as a name, ID number, location data or online identifier, or by factors specific to them, such as their physical, genetic, economic or social identity.

The privacy of our Subscribers is very important to us. Please read this Policy before using the Service or submitting any personal information. By using the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive, basis. You are encouraged to review the Policy whenever you visit the Site or use the Service to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

The Company is a global company, as such, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries. In transferring your personal information, in will rely on lawful measures to transfer your personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland, such as the EU standard contractual clauses or Privacy Shield Framework. If you are visiting the Service from the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that by providing this personal information, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to the other jurisdictions in which we operate.

 **NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBER’S CLIENTS, ETC:** If a Subscriber uses the Service to interact with or collect personal data from, other individuals, such as the Subscriber’s customers, employees, or agents (the “Data Subjects”), the Subscriber is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws in connection with the collection and/or processing of personal data of the Data Subjects. If you are a Data Subject please note that the Company has no relationship with you whatsoever and its only relation is with the Subscriber with whom you may interact. For any questions regarding the collection of your personal data or to amend your personal data, and for all other reasons, you must contact the Subscriber.

 **NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS:** Please note that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the Subscriber if the Subscriber collects personal data of the Data Subjects and any of the following two criteria are met: (i) the processing of personal data is done in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not; or (ii) the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the processing activities are related to: (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the EU; or (b) the monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the EU.

Because the Company does not collect or determine the use of any personal data of Data Subjects, nor the purpose for which such data is collected by the Subscriber, how such data is collected and how it is used, the Company does not act as a data controller as defined under GDPR and bears no responsibility under the GDPR associated with a data controller.

To the extent that the Company processes any Data Subject’s data, it should be considered only as a processor on behalf of the Subscriber as to any personal data that is subject to the requirements of GDPR. Please note that under GDPR you are regarded as a data controller in relation to the Data Subjects and as such must comply with the requirements of GDPR. While you may employ your own privacy policy, you agree and acknowledge that for as long as you use the Service and are subject to the GDPR, you must comply with the GDPR requirements.

Your obligations (which extend to your employees, agents, subcontractors, etc., collectively your “Personnel”) include, but are not limited to (i) promptly (and under no circumstances after seventy two hours) notifying the Company of becoming aware of any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed or any investigation by a governmental authority concerning your handling of personal data; (ii) promptly and in good faith responding to any inquiries or requests by the Company regarding the collection and/or processing of personal data by you; (iii) maintaining relevant records of collecting and/or processing of personal data subject to GDPR; (iv) transferring or processing the personal data outside the EU or European Economic Area in compliance with GDPR and with prior written notification of the Company; and (v) ensuring that your Personnel is aware of and complies with the foregoing obligations.

The Company is under no circumstances obligated to, but reserves the right to monitor (and audit) the Subscriber’s compliance with the foregoing. To the extent that the Company suffers any losses as a result of the breach by the Subscriber of the foregoing obligations or failure to abide by the foregoing obligations, the Subscriber shall hold harmless and shall fully indemnify the Company from such losses. The Company is not responsible for the content of any personal data of Data Subjects or any other information that is stored on the Company’s or its third party suppliers’ servers at the discretion of the Subscriber. The Company owes no responsibility and bears no liability to the Data Subjects. If you need a signed Data Processing Agreement in addition to this Policy and the Terms, please contact us at [privacy@pyrus.com](mailto:privacy@pyrus.com).

## How We Share The Information That We Collect

We share information, including personal information, with our third-party service providers that we use to provide hosting for and maintenance of the Service. These third-party service providers may have access to or process your personal information for the purpose of providing these services for us. We do not permit our third-party service providers to use the personal information that we share with them for any other purpose than necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent in our application's user interface.

We may share your personal data with courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators or attorneys or other parties where it is reasonably necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal or equitable claim, or for the purposes of a confidential alternative dispute resolution process. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms and conditions, or as otherwise required by law.

Where we rely on your consent to process the personal information, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests which are not already described in this Notice, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

Some user data collected by Service may be collected from third parties via user-configured integrations, with third party policies imposing restrictions on sharing data.
