# Privacy Policy

This Policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, products, and content ("Services").

**We value your privacy a lot. When you share information with us through the use of one of our Services, we make sure it is stored as securely as possible, and kept only for the purpose intended.**

As such, we never share the information you provide to third parties, except for chosen partners that are used for the purpose of providing you the Paper.li service.

You always remain in control of your data. You may edit or erase your data from our Services at any time.

When we refer to "we" or "us" in this policy, we mean [Finity SA](https://finity.ai/), which controls the information collected when you use the services (including but not limited to [Finity.ai](https://finity.ai/), [Paper.li](https://paper.li/), ...). This Policy does not apply to information collected by third-party Web sites linked to or otherwise accessible from [Paper.li](https://paper.li/). The information collected or received by third-party services is subject to their own privacy policies.

## How do we use the information we collect?

The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of operating and improving our Services.
