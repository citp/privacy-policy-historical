Our Commitment To Privacy :  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

Emailing a friend about our website :  
On some pages we allow you to email a friend who might be interested in certain pages of our website. We ask you to supply your email address so when your friend wants to reply to the email, the reply comes to you, and not to us. We do not store any email addresses, and your email address will simply be gone after the program has finished the procedure, and you see the final page. We do store your email address in a cookie on your computer. If you ever use the service again, we’ll “know” your email address and name, and you don’t have to fill out those lines anymore.(When you subscribe to some service then your email address is stored and can be used to send other offers or marketing email from our company or third party).

Google AdSense and cookies :  
We use Google AdSense to supply our visitors with relevant advertisements throughout our website. Google uses cookies in order to make these ads more relevant to our visitors.[ Learn more about cookies and how to opt-out of them](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

Cookies :  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.)  
We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.
