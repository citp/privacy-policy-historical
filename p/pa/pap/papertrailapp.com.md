**Customer Owned Data**

**Use of Personal Data**

The following is an overview of our purposes for using personal data that we process as a data controller. Additional details on how we process your personal data may be provided to you in a separate notice or contract. 

For individuals in the European Union, our processing (i.e. use) of your personal data is justified on the following legal bases: 

  * **Performance of Contract:** the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request;
  * **Compliance with Law:** the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation (for example, laws which require us to collect tax information from customers, carry out checks on customers, or which compel us to disclose information to public authorities or regulators);
  * **Our Legitimate Interests:** the processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using applicable data to conduct and develop our business activities, such as developing and maintaining relationships with our customers (the majority of the processing covered by this notice is legitimate interest based);* 
  * **Defend Our Rights:** where the processing is necessary to the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
  * **With Your Consent:** you have consented to the processing (for example, where we are required by local law to rely upon your prior consent for the purposes of direct marketing).



* In all cases where legitimate interests is relied upon as a lawful basis, we take steps to ensure that our legitimate interests are not outweighed by any prejudice to your rights and freedoms. This is achieved in a number of ways, including through the application of principles of data minimization and security, and by taking steps to ensure that personal data is only collected or otherwise obtained where it is relevant to the lawful business activities, and where using personal data is reasonably necessary for those activities.

**Disclosure of Personal Data**

SolarWinds is a global group of companies, and we may share personal data with our affiliated businesses as part of our business operations and administration of the Services. We may also appoint third party service providers (who will operate under our instructions) to assist us in providing information, products or services to you, in conducting and managing our business, or in managing and improving our Services or the Sites. SolarWinds may share your personal data with these affiliates and third parties to perform services that the third parties have been engaged by SolarWinds to perform on SolarWinds's behalf, subject to appropriate contractual restrictions and security measures, or if we believe it is reasonably necessary to prevent harm or loss, or it believes that the disclosure will further an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activities. 

SolarWinds reserves the right to share any information that is not deemed personal data or is not otherwise subject to contractual restrictions. 

If personal data is transferred outside the EU to other SolarWinds group companies or to third party service providers, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements, using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield. For transfers to other SolarWinds group companies in the United States (a country that has not received a decision from the European Commission determining that the United States provides adequate protection to personal data), we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, which protect personal data transferred between SolarWinds entities. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU by contacting [privacy@solarwinds.com](mailto:privacy@solarwinds.com). 

We contractually require agents, service providers, and affiliates who may process personal data related to the Services to provide the same level of protections for personal data as required under the Principles. SolarWinds currently does not transfer personal data to a third party for the third party’s own use, but only for SolarWinds’ purposes as outlined above. SolarWinds will remain liable under the Principles if one of its third party processors processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, if we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

**Other Disclosures**

_Law Enforcement or National Security_. In accordance with our legal obligations, we may also transfer Customer Data, subject to a lawful request, to public authorities for law enforcement or national security purposes. 

_Additional Disclosures_. We may also disclose Customer Data (including any personal data), where otherwise required by law. 

_Business Transfers. ****_ We may share personal data with third parties in connection with potential or actual sale of our company or any of our assets, or those of any affiliated company, in which case personal data held by us about our users may be one of the transferred assets. 

_Just-in-Time Disclosures._ Additional disclosures or information about processing of personal data related to specific websites, mobile applications, products, services, or programs may be provided to you. These may supplement and/or clarify SolarWinds privacy practices in specific circumstances and provide you with additional choices as to how SolarWinds may process your personal data.

**Security**

SolarWinds aims to safeguard and protect your personal data from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, and SolarWinds utilizes and maintains certain reasonable processes, systems, and technologies to do so. However, you acknowledge that no environment is completely secure or error-free, and that these processes, systems, and technologies utilized and maintained by SolarWinds are subject to compromise. Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control. 

**Retention of Your Personal Data**

We apply a general rule of keeping personal data only for as long as required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required. 

In specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges. 

**External Links**

The Sites may contain links to third party sites. Since SolarWinds does not control nor is responsible for the privacy practices of those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. This Policy applies solely to personal data collected by our Sites or in the course of our business activities.

  * to obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal data is transferred to a third country or international organization. 



In addition to the above rights, under EU data protection law, applicable individuals have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to any processing of your personal data for which we have justified on the basis of a legitimate interest, including profiling (as opposed to your consent) or to perform a contract with you. You also have the right to object at any time to any processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including profiling for marketing purposes. 

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority for data protection.
