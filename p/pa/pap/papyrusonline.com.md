#### Information Collected

Generally, you may visit the Papyrus website without revealing personal information about yourself other than an anonymous persistent identifier assigned by our website or by authorized third-party services. We or our authorized third-party service providers may also collect anonymous information including the type of device used to browse our website, the operating system, browser type or IP address, as well as behavioral usage data. This information enables us to improve our website, tailor our advertising for better relevance, and helps us discover any issues people may have in using our website.

During the process of making an online purchase, we ask for your name, email address, phone number, mailing address and your credit card information to complete your order. In some cases, we may use this information to further assist your ordering experience by reminding you of products that were left in your shopping bag or requesting feedback on purchased items. In addition, you may be able to submit information such as your name and/or e-mail address through various forms, including, contact forms and e-mail list sign-ups.

#### Use of Cookies & Similar Technologies

Papyrus and third-party vendors may use a browser feature known as a "cookie." Cookies are small text files placed on your computer that allow Papyrus to provide you with the basic functionality of an online store, such as saving the contents of your shopping cart or recognizing your log-in status between browsing sessions. Cookies and similar technologies may also be used by Papyrus and authorized third-party vendors, including Google, to collect non-personally identifiable information so that we may tailor our advertising or enhance your shopping experience according to your interests. We may use the following features to facilitate such interest-based advertising: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and other integrated Google services. We may not control those tracking technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you understand that when you use our website you may potentially encounter third-party tracking technologies and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the tracking technologies or practices of such third parties. Papyrus may also use cookies, pixel tags or similar technologies from authorized third-party services to collect anonymous browsing behavior for the purpose of analyzing visitor activity and using this data to improve our visitors' website experiences. Cookies are not used to store sensitive personal information.

#### Do Not Track Signals
