# Papa John's Pizza Privacy Policy

**Your privacy is important to us.**   
Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information. As we continuously improve and expand our services, this policy might change. So please check it out periodically. If you have questions about our policy, please click on our customer feedback page to contact us via our electronic feedback form or call us at 1-888-777-7272.

**How we collect information about you.**   
We collect information in three ways:

  1. We collect information that our customers supply to us.
  2. We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by our customers and users of our website.
  3. We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including customers, by means of cookies. 



Further details are provided below. 

**What personal information we collect from our users.**  
When you set up an account at papajohns.com to use our service, you are required to provide us with your full legal name, email address, full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. You must also choose your Username and Password and provide those to us.  The information being transmitted over papajohns.com is the same information you would be asked if ordering by telephone from our restaurants.

Every time you use our service, we collect information about the Papa John's restaurants you select and the orders you place.

**We collect additional information about how you use our website and service.**   
If you contact us by letter, phone, or email through the contact information on the "Customer Feedback" page, we will collect your sender information and may collect the other information you voluntarily disclose to us.

**Our use of cookies.**   
Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies are small strings of data placed on users' personal computer hard drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and in recording any preferences you indicate on our website. We also use cookies to make your experience on papajohns.com more personalized, and convenient.

Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website, a cookie identifies your browser and user id (and not your identity). If you place orders with us, we use cookies to assist in storing your preferences and recording other session information (a "session" is a single visit by you to our website).

**How we store the information we collect.**   
We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our computer servers containing our databases. Access to our computer servers is controlled by firewalls and security gatekeepers.

**How we use the information we collect.**   
We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. First, the next time you use our service and enter your User ID and Password, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your order faster and easier.

We also keep track of your food preferences and restaurant choices and analyze that information. We do so in order to be able to email to you special advertisements, offers and notices regarding foods and restaurants that seem to fit with your preferences.

We do not sell your personal information, or any information that can be identified to you personally, to any third-party marketers or other third parties. We do aggregate information about how our service is used (without specific identification to any particular user) to be able to improve our service and make it more responsive to our customers' preferences. We also make such aggregate information (without identification to any specific individual) available to our restaurant affiliates and other affiliates in order to obtain information about products, services, offers and notices which we believe will be useful and informative to our website users.

**Promotions and Prizes**   
We search for merchants who sponsor promotions, offer prizes (Contests) or give our customers great discounts that we believe are of interest to our users. When we find such merchants, we provide the means on our website, newsletter or emails for our papajohns.com users to register for the contests or receive great offers. When you register for a contest, your name and email address are provided to the merchant sponsoring the contest.

**You can control how information about you is used.**   
You can also limit our communications directly to you. If you do not want to receive emails telling you about our great eDeals in the future, please let us know. You can change your preferences, or opt out of receiving emails, at any time (except when you are in the process of placing an order) by going to My Account Information on the log in page. There, you can update your email address, phone numbers, password, address and you can uncheck the "Send me special offers from Papa John's" box. Our emails to you will stop within 5 business days.

Papa John's may from time to time send non promotional email to all registered users for the purpose of gathering and dispersing data to provide better services to our customers. Registered users will be under no obligation to reply or answer questions in said non promotional email. Non promotional email will include, but will not be limited to surveys, maintenance notices and system updates.

**Our policies may change.**   
This is our current privacy and security policy, but we reserve the right to change our website and this policy at any time. You should check this privacy policy periodically. If our policies regarding collection, storage and use of your information change, the information collected under prior policies will continue to be governed by those policies, unless we obtain your consent to use that information in new ways.

**You can access your information.**   
Upon your request, we will provide you with access to your unique account-related information and information from contacts that we maintain about you. In your request, please provide us with your current specific contact information so that we can accurately check our records.

**How is my information protected?**   
Your information is password-protected. In order to maintain this protection, we caution you not to provide your password to anyone. We do not give your password to anyone. We recommend that, if you share your computer with other people, you close your browser window when your session is completed. Signing off will protect your information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library.

**Please contact us with any questions or comments.**
