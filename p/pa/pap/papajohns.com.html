                                    Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information. As we continuously improve and expand our services, this policy might change. So please check it out periodically. If you have questions about our policy, please click on our customer feedback page to contact us via our electronic feedback form.
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">How we collect information about you. We collect information in three ways:</span><br>

</p><ol>
<li>We collect information that our customers supply to us.</li>
<li>We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by our customers and users of our website.</li>
<li>We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including customers, by means of cookies.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Further details are provided below.</b>
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">What personal information we collect from our users.</span><br>
When you set up an account at papajohns.com to use our online ordering service, you are required to provide us with your full legal name, email address, full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. You must also choose your Username and Password and provide those to us.
<br><br>

Every time you use our service, we collect information about the Papa John's restaurants you select and the orders you place.
<br><br>

When you place an order with us by telephone or means other than our online ordering service, you may be required to provide us with your full legal name, full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. Every time you place an order, we will collect information about the Papa John's restaurants you select and the orders you place.
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">Children's Privacy</span><br>
Online ordering, customer registration for on-line ordering, and customer feedback pages of this website are directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 13 or older. We do not establish or maintain registrations for any child whom we know to be under the age of 13. We do not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have received personally identifiable information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our systems.
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">We collect additional information about how you use our website and service.</span><br>

<span class="copybold">Our use of cookies.</span><br>
Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies are small strings of data placed on users' personal computer hard drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and in recording any preferences you indicate on our website. We also use cookies to make your experience on papajohns.com more personalized, and convenient.
<br><br>

Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website, a cookie identifies your browser and user id (and not your identity). If you place orders with us, we use cookies to assist in storing your preferences and recording other session information (a "session" is a single visit by you to our website).
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">How we store the information we collect.</span><br>
We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our computer servers containing our databases. Access to our computer servers is controlled by firewalls and security gatekeepers.
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">How we use the information we collect.</span><br>
We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. First, the next time you use our online ordering service and enter your User ID and Password, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your order faster and easier.
<br><br>

When you use your papajohns.com account, we also keep track of your food preferences and restaurant choices and analyze that information. We do so in order to be able to email to you special advertisements, offers and notices regarding foods and restaurants that seem to fit with your preferences.
<br><br>

We also use the personal information about you stored in our customer database through telephone and other non-online orders in various ways. Each time you place an order, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your order faster and easier. We also may keep track of your food preferences and restaurant choices and analyze that information in order to be able mail to you special advertisements, offers and notices regarding foods and restaurants that seem to fit with your preferences. We may also use the information to contact you concerning your level of satisfaction with our products and services, to verify incomplete orders, rectify problems or delays with your order or otherwise communicate with you concerning your transactions with us.

<br><br>

We may provide your personal information to our restaurant affiliates and franchisees in order to enable your local Papa John's restaurant(s) to better serve you. We also aggregate information about how our online ordering service is used (without specific identification to any particular user) to be able to improve our service and make it more responsive to our customers' preferences. We also make such aggregate information (without identification to any specific individual) available to our restaurant affiliates and other affiliates in order to obtain information about products, services, offers and notices which we believe will be useful and informative to our website users.
<br><br>

If you use our website to purchase Papa Cards without setting up a papajohns.com account, your personal information is used solely to process and confirm your transaction.
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">Promotions and Prizes</span><br>
We search for merchants who sponsor promotions, offer prizes (Contests), give our customers great discounts or make available other valuable offers that we believe may be of interest to our customers. When we find such merchants, we may provide to them the means via our website, mail, or email to contact you about their offers. However, if you have opted not to receive e-mails or other communications from us (See "You can control how information about you is used" below), will not provide your e-mail address, mailing address or other data or information to any third party for promotional or other commercial purposes, except with your prior consent.
<br><br>

You are under no obligation to respond to any offer or promotion but if you do , you may be required to provide additional information, such as your birth date and whether you or anyone in your household is employed by the merchant who is extending the offer , in order to verify your eligibility for accepting the offer or participation in the Contest. If you do respond to an offer or promotion of one of these merchants, your provision of information to the merchant will be governed by the merchant's privacy policy, not the Papa John's privacy policy.
<br><br><br>

<span class="copybold">You can control how information about you is used.</span><br>

You can also limit our communications directly to you. If you have a papajohns.com account and do not want to receive emails from us telling you about great eDeals, Contests or other promotional offers in the future, please let us know. You can change your preferences, or opt out of receiving emails from us, at any time (except when you are in the process of placing an order) by going to My Account Information on the log in page. There, you can update your email address, phone numbers, password, address and you can uncheck the <i>"Send me special offers from Papa John's"</i> box. Our emails to you will stop within 5 business days and we will not thereafter provide other merchants the means to contact you by e-mail about their Contests or other offers.
<br><br>

Papa John's may from time to time send nonpromotional email to all registered users of our online ordering service for the purpose of gathering and dispersing data to provide better services to our customers. Except for provision of additional information necessary to complete a transaction initiated by a registered user, registered users will be under no obligation to reply or answer questions in said nonpromotional email. Nonpromotional email may include, but will not be limited to, surveys, maintenance notices, system updates and confirmation or other notices in connection with completion of a transaction initiated by a registered user.
<br><br>

If you would rather not receive offers or mailings other than e-mails from us or other merchants that we select, please use the <a href="feedback/">Customer Feedback</a> link on our website or send your name and address to:
