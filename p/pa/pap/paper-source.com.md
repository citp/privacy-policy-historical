This information may be used to target advertising messages to you based on your interests. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie and pixel tag, which is an industry standard technology used by most major websites.

Secure Shopping

This site uses a secure server (SSL) to encrypt all of your personal information. We use strong security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information once it is in our records. 

Our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), which is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. SSL is designed to render information unreadable should anyone try to intercept it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. In addition, Paper Source _does not store credit card number information._ When ordering online, this information is sent directly to the authorizing banks. 

_Please note_ : Email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers. We will **_never_** ask for sensitive information via email. 

Privacy Policy Updates

Paper Source reserves the right to change or modify this policy at any time by posting the revised policy on our website, effective immediately. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you purchase products from us or use our website.
