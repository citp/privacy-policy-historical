## MARKETING 

If you have said we can, we’ll send you marketing messages by email, SMS or direct mail. Sometimes, we may use purchase history, wishlist or saved items to increase our knowledge or what our customers like, so that we can make sure we’re talking to you about things you’re interested in. 

You can stop receiving marketing messages by: 

  * Updating your settings in My Preferences in your account online
  * Contacting our Customer Service team on 0203 322 4788 or contacting them [online](https://www.paperchase.com/en_gb/contact/)
  * Clicking unsubscribe link on any email or replying with the correct STOP message to any SMS



We’ll update your information as soon as possible, but it may take a few days for all our systems to update. We will still continue to send service messages such as order or Treat Me treat updates. 

## KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION

We’ll hold on to your information for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or as is required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions. 

At the end of that retention period your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised – for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and planning.

Some examples of customer data retention periods:

_Orders_  
When you place an order, we’ll keep the personal data you give us for two years so we can comply with our legal, financial and contractual obligations. 

_Inactive accounts_  
If you’ve not used your account for more than two years, it will be flagged as inactive and we’ll contact you to ask whether you want to keep it open. Unless you reply to say ‘yes’, we’ll close the account and delete or anonymise the personal data associated with it. 

See our Data Retention policy for more details.
