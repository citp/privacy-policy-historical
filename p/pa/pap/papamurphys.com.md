**OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS**

We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms, including tracking technologies designed for mobile apps, to track information about your use of our Website and our App. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).

**Cookies** : Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive or your device through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Website and our App, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities. 

**Disabling Cookies:** Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies on your web browser, you will be able to view our Website, but our ordering platform may not work properly.

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies:** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website and our App to, among other things, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

**Do-Not-Track:** Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions at the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance websites](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed).

**Third Party Analytics:** We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate use of our Website and, to the extent permitted, our App. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our services. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.

**Targeted Advertising and Ad Networks**

We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities on the Website and our App. We may also participate in third party ad networks and allow third parties to use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies on the Website to collect usage information and display targeted ads on third party websites; these third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. If you use our App, you also may receive banner ads.

In order to assist us in displaying more relevant advertisements on our Website and App, manage our advertising on third-party sites, App and online services and to evaluate and improve the success of our advertising campaigns, we may work with third parties such as third-party ad companies, ad exchanges, channel partners, measurement services and network advertisers to—for example, Facebook and Google. 

  * **_Facebook Ads_** : for more info and choices, see their [privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/) and [ad preferences page](http://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads)
  * **_Google/DoubleClick_** : for more info and choices, see their [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) and [ads help](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en) page



Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Website and App.

**Custom Audiences and Matching** : We may disclose certain information (such as your email address) with third parties – such as Facebook (more info on Facebook Custom Audience [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads) or see above) so that we can better target ads and content to our users, and others with similar interests on these third parties’ platforms or networks (“Custom Audiences”). We may also work with third party ad networks and marketing platforms that enable us and other participants to target ads to Custom Audiences submitted by us and others. As noted above, you may also control how Facebook and other third parties display certain ads to you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies.

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks and obtain more information about targeting advertising through one of the following links:  

  * [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)  
  * [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) 



Opting out of one or more ad networks only means that those networks no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other web sites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. 

**THIRD PARTY LINKS**

We may provide links on our Website or through our App to third party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.

**SECURITY OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, mobile device, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

**ACCESS TO MY PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You may modify certain personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Website or App for a period of time.

**YOUR CHOICES**

We may send periodic promotional emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us. If you opt-in we may also send you marketing texts; you also may opt-out of the text messaging program by texting "STOP" at any time to 90421.

**Deactivation of Your App Account:** At any time, you may remove the App from your phone by following the instructions on your device. In addition, you may "close" your App account by logging into order.papamurphys.com from your desktop, clicking “My Account,” clicking “cancel your account” under the “Close Account” heading and follow any instructions.

Information collected by the App is not deleted when you "close" your account, and Papa Murphy’s and its service providers may retain access to the information that you submitted through the App.

**CHILDREN UNDER 13**

Our services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide us their personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we may from time-to-time share with third parties for their own direct marketing use; such requests may be made once per calendar year for information about any relevant third party sharing in the prior calendar year.
