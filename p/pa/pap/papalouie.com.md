6\. Security

The security of your data is important to us, and we work hard to protect our visitors' privacy with reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality and protections. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure however, so we can not guarantee the absolute security of transmitted or collected data. For visitors using the Flipline Studios Forum, this account information is protected by a password, and we encourage users to choose a unique and effective password and to keep it secure. 

7\. Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Information

Data protection laws in the EU require a legal basis and legitimate interest for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens and residents of the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our lawful bases and legitimate interests for collecting and process your person information include:

  * We have a legitimate interest in collecting analytics and measurements of the usage of our website to improve and maintain our website and services for our visitors.  

  

  * We have a legitimate interest in enabling data collection for third party advertisements in order to provide a more customized ad experience for our visitors and app users.  

  

  * It is contractually necessary to collect and process usernames, email addresses, password details, IP addresses, cookie data, and similar information to fulfill our obligations in the terms of service of the Flipline Studios Forum. Additionally, we have a legitimate interest to protect the Flipline Studios Forum from abuse and fraud, and this collected information is required to fulfill this interest. 



8\. Data Minimization

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we collect and process is limited to what is reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes outlined in this Policy. When appropriate, we will collect and process anonymized data rather than your full information in order to protect your privacy. 

9\. Controlling Your Information

Users residing in certain countries who are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation have certain rights related to personal information that is collected, including access to their data, correcting their data, withdrawing consent for processing data, and requesting deletion of their data. If you wish to access, update, or delete your personal information, please contact us at privacy@flipline.com.

Please see Section 4 for more information about advertising cookies and how you can control your information in regards to advertisements.

10\. In-App Purchases

Many of our mobile apps offer additional purchaseable content as In-App Purchases. When an In-App Purchase is requested, all relevant account information is sent to the store provider (Apple, Google, or Amazon) to complete the purchase, and this information is not collected by us.

For children using our mobile apps, parents and guardians should be aware that they can prevent unwanted purchases by requiring a password before in-app purchases can be made. Parents and guardians are responsible for maintaining security on their devices, as the store providers will not always honor refunds for purchases when proper security is not followed.
