## Privacy Policy

**Overview**

PAJAMAS MEDIA is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Our readers’ privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to us, our Contributors and our advertisers. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve you, our readers, and protect your privacy. At the end of this policy we have provided contact information, should you have any additional questions.

Pajamas Media collects two basic types of information: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Personally Identifiable Information is information that would allow you to be identified and might include: name, address, telephone number, fax number, or credit card information.  Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include: the IP address of the server your computer is logged into, your browser type, your screen resolution setting, the Web pages you visited, which ads have been displayed and whether you responded to any ads delivered by PJM.  Email addresses may or may not include PII. For example you might have your first and last name, or even your first and last name and city in your email address, or you might have an email address that is associated with a URL and website that contains PII. In those cases your email address would include PII. However, not all email addresses contain, or can be linked to PII.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

**Applicability of Policy**

In order to bring you offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages.

**Information Collected**

PJM does not obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, when you visit PJM or read any articles contained on our site.  PJM may, however, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you which is specific to how you use the Internet, such as the IP address of the server your computer is logged into, your browser type, your screen resolution setting, the Web pages you visited, which ads have been displayed and whether you responded to any ads delivered by PJM. This non-personally identifiable information collected by PJM is used for the purpose of determining which ads to deliver and for measuring aggregate advertising display and response for client and network reporting.

Also, as a result of your visit to our site, PJM’s ad server(s) and web analytics partners, may collect non-personally identifiable information such as your domain type, your IP address, your ad display history, and your clickstream information.

Information collected by Pajamas Media about individual visitors that is stored in the ad server database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant or third party, except when required by law or court order or as set forth in this Policy. PJM does disclose aggregate advertising information, which does not identify individuals or any personally identifiable information, to business partners, advertisers, and other advertising third parties. PJM also reserves the right to use such non-personally identifiable information for promoting PJM products and services or the products and services of PJM advertisers and sponsors.
