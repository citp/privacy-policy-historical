The privacy policy is not applicable to each individual blog site itself. Each participating blog may have its own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand. PJM has no authority over each web site’s individual privacy policy, only over information collected about the web sites’ traffic and the advertising displayed throughout the sites in the overall blog network.
