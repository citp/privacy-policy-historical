In addition, we monitor the volume and timing of access to our site by collecting information on the date, time and pages accessed by visitors.

Again, only aggregate information is collected, and individual visitors’ personal information is not identified. 

If you choose to share personal information with us – by sending us a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information – we will use the information only for the purposes you authorized. Some of the Information may be saved for a designated period to comply with Florida’s archiving policies, but we will not disclose the information to third parties or other government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law.
