# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Paleoplan.com web site (hereinafter “Website”). Paleoplan, LLC (hereinafter “We”) understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy, and this Privacy Policy describes how we use personal information that is collected at this Website.  

Please read this Privacy Policy before using this Website or submitting any personal information. California residents, please also see the “Note To California Residents” Section for additional rights that apply to you.

By using this Website, you accept the privacy practices contained in this Privacy Policy. These privacy practices may change from time to time, but any changes will be posted. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Website to make sure you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

  1.  **Information We Collect**



 **A.** **Personally Identifiable Information (Including Data That Is Shared With Third Parties / Affiliate Entities)**




  
In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. Most of your customer information is stored in a third-party Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) system [insert name], and not directly on our servers.  Your credit card information is not stored by us, and is instead [passed directly to Stripe or whatever is accurate].

We may use your personal information, transfer your personal information, and/or sell your personal information for any legal purpose, including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the products and/or services to you that you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms and conditions; (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of the web site or product(s); and (5) to bring retail opportunities and promotional offers to you by email, direct mail, telemarketing, and/or online banner advertising. 

 **By submitting your email and telephone information on this web site, you agree to receive email and telephone calls from us and the following sister companies (that are separate entities but owned by some of the same principals): PaleoHacks LLC (**[ **www.paleohacks.com**](http://www.paleohacks.com/) **) and iRollie Marketing LLC (**[ **www.irolliemarketing.com**](http://www.irolliemarketing.com/) **).  **

We, and our third party service providers, may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.

By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for custom audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us.  

If you wish to stop seeing ads from us on Facebook, you can turn off the ad by using the following steps:

  1. From within Facebook, go to the advertisement you want to turn off.
  2. Click on the drop-down arrow in the top corner of the ad (that may be in the top right corner or top left corner).
  3. Click on “Hide ad”. 



You can also customize the ads you see in Facebook across all advertisers by using the following steps:

  1. Log in to your Facebook account and click “settings”. 
  2. Click on “Ads”. 
  3. On that page you will see a list of options you can choose to limit and/or block the information Facebook shows to advertisers.



If you wish to stop seeing ads from us in Google Ads, you can turn off the ad by using the following steps:

  1. Go to the advertisement you want to turn off.
  2. Click on the x in the top left corner.
  3. Click on “Stop seeing this ad”.



Other ad platforms we may use in the future have similar ways you can turn off any ad from us to stop seeing it.

In addition, you agree that by submitting your telephone contact information on this web site and/or registering to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR ‘310 et seq. and any applicable state and local “do not call” regulations. We and the select few third party service providers receiving your data as described herein retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations.

When your information is provided to third parties, these third parties may include providers of direct marketing services and applications. We or these third parties may supplement the information we collect online with outside records to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and/or to offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us. 

By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive information on other products and services that may be of interest to you, including related third party offers that we may send to you. You also enable us to personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service. 

 **B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

We also may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information to help us make your experience more enjoyable, measure site activity to identify future improvements that should be made, and compile aggregate data to help serve site visitors better.  

For example, we may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, web beacons, GIF/pixel tags, banner ads, third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), third party retargeting networks that may display our advertisements to you on other sites that you visit to remind you about us, and third party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., for a refer-a-friend email) to collect non-personally identifiable or other aggregated information about site visitors.

Cookies are text files that are used by your computer’s web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our Website. Third party retargeting networks may also use cookies to display our advertisements to you on other sites.  You can learn more about how to opt-out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Emails or newsletters that we send electronically may use techniques such as web beacons or pixel tags to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience, such as the number of emails that are opened, whether they were forwarded or printed, the type of device from which they were opened, and the location (e.g. city, state, and county) associated with the applicable IP address.

If you visit this Website with an open ID (such as Facebook), you may also be sharing and integrating data with third-party social media sites, and we may track aggregate data about the number of visits to this Website with an open ID, the number of items “liked” on this Website, or items on this Website that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.

Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time. The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.  

Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals that are undefined.

Please note that you do have the option to configure most web browsers to NOT accept cookies.  However, be aware that disabling cookies may keep you from having access to some functions or services on our Website or the web-hosted software that runs on our Website.

  2.  **Third Party Actions**



We do not control and are not liable for the actions of any third parties who we may promote and/or link to from this Website. We pride ourselves in recommending quality companies, but have no control over the actions of those third parties, the content they provide, or their privacy practices. While we are not liable for any of the actions of those third parties, you should feel free to give us feedback from time to time on your experiences with any third parties to whom we work with so that we may enhance our future service to all customers.

  3.  **Children’s Privacy**



We do not knowingly intend to collect personally identifiable information from children under 18 years of age. If your minor child has provided us with personally identifiable information, you may contact us at the phone number or mailing address listed in the section entitled “Contacting Us” if you want this information deleted from our records. We will then make reasonable efforts to remove your child’s information from the database that stores the information.

  4.  **IP Addresses**



We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather broad demographic information, and to offer you products and services.

  5.  **Commitment to Data Security**



  
All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. Furthermore, employees, contractors, and vendors who have access to your personally identifiable information in connection with providing services for us are required to keep the information confidential.

We use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, and we do everything we can to protect user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

  6.  **Updating, Removing, or Exporting your Personal Information**



If you are a subscriber to one of our mailing lists, you can customize your information and the mailing lists you have subscribed to at any time by simply clicking the link called “Manage Preferences” at the bottom of any email you receive from us.  That will take you to a preferences center where you can update your information and communication preferences.

If you have questions about the use, amendment, or deletion of Personal Information that you have provided to Us, or if you would like to opt out of future communications from us, please contact us using the information below in the Contacting Us section.

If you are a European subject and wish to request that we forget you from our database, please send an email to mail@Paleoplan.com with the subject line “Forget Me” and explain in the body of the email that you are asking to have your personal data deleted.  To protect user privacy, you must send such a request from the account information we have on file or the request will not be honored. We reserve the right to retain any data that we are required to maintain under applicable laws. Some data will be anonymized rather than deleted; this means that some of the data will be held in a form that cannot be connected to you personally. Please be aware that once we delete your data, we will be unable to “undelete” it.

If you are a European subject and wish to request that we export your data, such as for purposes of porting it to another vendor, please send an email to mail@Paleoplan.com with the subject line “Export My Data” and explain in the body of the email that you are asking for a data export.  We have a standard data export format that we will provide and are not able to create custom exports. To protect user privacy, you must send such a request from the account information we have on file or the request will not be honored.  

You may also have other rights under applicable federal, state, or local laws.

  7.  **Contacting Us**



If you need to contact us, you can email us at mail@Paleoplan.com, or send us a letter at: Paleoplan LLC, 311 West Third St, Suite 3991, Carson City, Nevada 89703.

We strive to provide excellent products, along with equally excellent customer service. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please feel free to contact us using one of the methods listed above.

  8.  **Severability**



If any part of this Privacy Policy is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. 

  9.  **Note To California Residents**



If you live in the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request that companies who conduct business in California provide you with a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. 

Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (often referred to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, that the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 

This Website qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 

If you are a California resident and want to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Please send an email to the Privacy Administrator at [support@Paleoplan.com](mailto:mail@paleohacks.com),  or you may contact us via regular mail at: 

311 West Third St, Suite 3991, Carson City, Nevada 89703

 **All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the email subject line or envelope and clearly stated on the actual request.** For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Please include your zip code for our own record keeping. 

 **We do not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.** We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
