Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information
        We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you
provide to us. Here are a couple of ways you can have control over your information:
        •       Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to
                refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being
                sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this
                site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
        •       Promotional Offers from the Company. If you do not wish to receive
                promotional e-mail messages from us, you can opt-out by checking the

                information or by sending us an e-mail stating your request to
                                               3


                support@palantir.com. If we have sent you a promotional e-mail, you may
                send an email to support@palantir.com asking to be omitted from future e-
                mail distributions.
Data Integrity and Proportionality
        We only collect as much personal information as needed for specific, identified
purposes and we will not use it in any way that is incompatible with the purpose for
which it was collected or authorized by you.
Accessing and Correcting Your Information
        We take reasonable steps to keep your personal information accurate and
complete. You may send us an e-mail at support@palantir.com to request access to your
personal information you have provided to us for the purpose of correcting, amending or
deleting data that is inaccurate. We will do our best to respond to your request in a timely
manner and grant your request as required by law.
Security
        We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect and secure
your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. The safety and
security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where
you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our websites, you are
responsible for keeping this password confidential. Please do not share your password
with anyone.
        Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your personal
information, for example, by using Secure Socket Layer encryption when you transmit
your password, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted
to our websites. The transmission of information via the internet is not 100% secure and
we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. We are
not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
on the websites.
Changes to Our Privacy and Security Statement
        We may amend this Privacy and Security Statement from time to time. We
encourage you to revisit this page periodically to read the current version of this
statement in effect.
Enforcement
        We use a periodic self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this
statement. If you have any concerns or questions about this statement, please contact us
and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes either through
our internal process, or if necessary, through an independent dispute resolution
mechanism.
