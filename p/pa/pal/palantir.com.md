This may include details of your visits to our websites, including information about your connectivity, such as your IP address and browser information, location data, logs and other communication data, and the resources that you access and use on the websites. This information helps us to improve our websites and to deliver better and more personalized content and services by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns and recognize you when you return to our websites.

_General business-related information._ We may also receive other personal information from or about you in the ordinary course of our business.

#### Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. Here are a couple of ways you can have control over your information:

  * Tracking Technologies and Advertising. Depending on your browser, you may be able to change settings to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
  * Promotional Offers from the Company. If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mail messages from us, you can opt-out by sending us an e-mail at [privacy@palantir.com](mailto:privacy@palantir.com) asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions.



#### Data Integrity and Proportionality

We only collect and retain as much personal information as needed for specific, identified purposes described in this Privacy and Security Policy and we will not use it in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.

#### Accessing and Correcting Your Information

We take reasonable steps to keep your personal information accurate and complete. You may send us an e-mail at [privacy@palantir.com](mailto:privacy@palantir.com) to request access to your personal information you have provided to us for the purpose of correcting, amending or deleting data that is inaccurate. We will do our best to respond to your request in a timely manner and grant your request as required by law.

#### Security

We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect and secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Please do not share your password with anyone.

Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, for example, by using Secure Socket Layer encryption when you transmit your password, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our websites. The transmission of information via the internet is not 100% secure and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the websites.
