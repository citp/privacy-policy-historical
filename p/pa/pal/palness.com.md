**Palness Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is important to us. We will never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online outside the context of this Policy. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.   
**  
Information Collected Upon Registration:**

When you create or reconfigure a Palness account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, address, username and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.   
**  
Additional Information: **

You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find Palness users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional. 

**Following, Lists and other Public Information:**

Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Post and the metadata provided with the post, such as when you Post on the forum or elsewhere, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the blogs you mark as favorites or any content and many other bits of information. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, your public Post are searchable by many search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by posting or blogging, not just your profile informations. 

What you say on Palness may be viewed all around the world instantly.
