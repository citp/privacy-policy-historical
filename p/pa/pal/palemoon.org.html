      <h1> Pale Moon Privacy Policy </h1>
As
part of normal operation, the Pale Moon browser connects to several
services run by us and (in limited capacity) third parties. These
connections include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Program updates (Pale Moon operated).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Security list updates like the blocklist for add-ons (Pale
Moon operated).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Add-on updates (Pale Moon operated).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Geolocation services (provided by IP-API.com).<br>
This service will only receive your IP address and generic browser data
through a normal http request. No local network or location data will
be sent to this provider. You have the option to disable this feature
and you are in control which websites are allowed to request this
information or trigger a geolocation lookup.</li>
        <li>Secure
certificate verification: when you visit a secure
website (i.e. "HTTPS"), Pale Moon will validate the website's
certificate. This may involve communicating with a third-party status
provider (e.g. OCSP) specified by the certificate. Pale Moon sends
information identifying the site's certificate to this third-party. </li>
        <li>Search and search suggestions (provided by your chosen
search provider): When you perform a web
search from the address bar or search bar, your query and standard web
browser information will be sent to the search provider to service your
request. <br>
Search suggestions is a feature to help you to find out common phrases
that other people have searched for. These search suggestions are
offered by your search engines (such as DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, etc.) and
not by Pale Moon. If you enable this feature, and your chosen search
engine supports suggestions, Pale Moon may send the terms you type in
the address bar or search bar to your chosen search engine provider to
retrieve suggestions.<br>
How this data is handled is governed by the applicable Privacy Policy
of your chosen search engine provider.</li>
        <li>Optional: Pale Moon Sync (Pale Moon operated)<br>
If you choose to use the Pale Moon Sync service, your usage will be
governed by <a href="http://www.palemoon.org/sync/">that particular
service's policies</a>.</li>
      </ul>
For performance reasons, any of these connections may also be served
through one or more content delivery networks (CDNs) and as such also
subject to the Privacy Policies of such CDNs.<br>
      <br>
You can turn off the above update and verification features, but that
may leave you open to security vulnerabilities. Specific instructions
for turning off the relevant features can be found on our forum. In
case of doubt, feel free to ask any of our user community members.<br>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
Pale
Moon related sites and services are operated under the following
privacy policy:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: right;">Last updated: 2017-03-09.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
Your personal privacy is important to us. This is why we adhere to <span style="font-style: italic;">common sense</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">best practice</span>
principles in the way we operate our sites and services. To clarify
these
principles, this privacy policy highlights the most important aspects
of your visits, your data, and our handling thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>How We Collect Data</h3>
We collect data about your visit and use of our sites and services in
industry-standard ways. Normal operational data is collected in site
access logs, and your session data for parts of our sites where you log
in (e.g. the forum) will be collected and stored in the relevant
databases.<br>
      <h3>What Data We Collect</h3>
As part of your visit, we will collect your IP address, user agent, and
any referrers sent by your browser. We also log the nature of your
visit and which parts of the sites and/or services you have accessed.<br>
In addition, for account-relative actions (that require you to set up
an account and log in, e.g. the forum), we collect personal information
like your name, a password and e-mail address. Only those items of
personal information necessary to operate the accounts or provide
services will be
required. Any other volunteered information is at your own discretion.<br>
We do not collect telemetry on your browser use or extension use.<br>
Occasionally, we may collect data on specific update requests over a
short period of time to measure the approximate size of our user base.<br>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
We protect your data by:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Limiting administrative access to our servers to required
staff only.</li>
        <li>Keeping various collection stores separated and properly
secured against public access.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Offering SSL encryption where it is prudent or expected.</li>
        <li>Encrypting passwords (and potentially other credentials)
that are stored in our databases in a non-reversible way.</li>
        <li>Occasionally pruning our stored data (see Data Retention)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data Retention</h3>
In principle we store data only for as long as is reasonably
necessary/commonly practiced to operate our sites and services.<br>
Site access logs are cycled regularly, at which point particuarly
old entries will be discarded. This retention never exceeds 1 year.<br>
Forum accounts are pruned occasionally to prevent unnecessary storage
of personal information in our database (based on last-logged-in data).<br>
      <h3>Data disclosure to third parties</h3>
Data about your visits is not transmitted to any third parties. Any
backup and inspection of such data will be restricted to transfer over
encrypted connections to prevent eavesdropping.<br>
      <br>
In principle, we never disclose visitor data to third parties,
including our partners. An exception to this non-disclosure principle
is if your visit or behavior is either suspect of abuse or criminal
activity (i.e.: if you perform misconduct, we may report you to the
relevant authorities), or if such disclosure is mandated by a court
order that is valid in the country where either the domain owner or the
hosting server resides (i.e.: we will not obstruct justice, but will
not volunteer this information unless legally required to do so).<br>
We may also disclose this information in order to establish, exercise
or defend our legal rights (including providing information to third
parties to prevent fraud).<br>
      <h3>User Trust and Disclaimer<br>
      </h3>
By using our sites and services, you indicate, as a user, that you
trust our
integrity and handling of your data. If you cannot, for any reason,
place this kind of trust in us, then you should refrain from using our
sites and services.<br>
      <br>
Additionally, although we will do our best to provide full transparency
and privacy of your personal information, we cannot 100% guarantee your
data's safety due to the distributed nature of our sites and global
distribution of assets, and reliance of our sites and services
on third party providers. We cannot be held liable for any losses ,
monetary or otherwise, resulting from your visits, the use of our sites
and services, or the personal information collected on/by them.<br>
      <h3>Amendments</h3>
This privacy policy may be updated from time to time by publishing a
new version on our website.<br>
You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are still in
agreement with this policy and are happy with any changes to it.<br>
      <h3>Your rights</h3>
You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we
hold about you. Providing said information will be subject to (in that
order):<br>
      <ol>
        <li>The payment of a non-refundable fee (fixed at €10).</li>
        <li>Submission of sufficient information for us to contact you
for verification.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Verification of your identity to ensure no personal
information is disclosed to unauthorized parties.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
You may also request for us to remove any personal
information linked to your visits, insofar this personal information is
easily accessible (e.g. a forum account). You must provide us with
sufficient information to verify the validity of your request. We will
follow up on your request for such within a reasonable amount of time.<br>
