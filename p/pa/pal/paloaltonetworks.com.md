## Do-Not-Track

There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal.

At present, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.

We do not sell, lease, rent or give away Your Information.

Palo Alto Networks is a global company, with affiliates in many countries. To conduct our business, Your Information may be transferred to Palo Alto Networks in the United States, or to subsidiaries of Palo Alto Networks, which may be in Europe, in the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific or Japan. Transfers will occur in compliance with applicable requirements.

### Service Providers processing data on our behalf.

We may employ third party companies and individuals to provide services associated with the Site, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, and improvement of the Site's features), to analyze use of our Site or to conduct marketing activities on our behalf (e.g., email management firms and internet advertising platforms, etc.), to perform collection services, to deliver requested goods and services to you.

We may only disclose personal information to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency in response to:

In such events, customer information is usually one of the business assets transferred. If we are acquired, a substantial portion of our assets is sold, or experience some other change in control, Your Information may be part of the assets acquired by or transferred to a third party. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

## Security

The security of Your Information is important to us. We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Your Information from misuse, unauthorized or unlawful access or disclosure, loss, alteration, damage or destruction. These measures include:

**Physical safeguards,** with locked doors and file cabinets, controlled access to our facilities and secure destruction of media containing Your Information.

**Technology safeguards,** like the use of anti-malware, encryption, monitoring of our systems and data centers, firewalls, encrypted channels, and secure communications software, to safeguard the confidentiality of Your Information.
