# Privacy

_Effective June 9, 2011_

Palo Alto Networks, Inc. provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of [www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) and any subdomains related thereto (collectively, this " **Site** "). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site.

## Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.

### Personally Identifiable Information.

When you register with us through the Site or when you conduct other activities on the Site, including, but not limited to, requesting information, requesting an online product demonstration or registering for a webcast, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (" **Personal Information** "). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, company name, phone number, email address and business postal address. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide services associated with the Site, to fulfill your requests for information about us or our products, and to contact you about our products or services. We do not take payment on our site and will not ask you for financial information.

We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration or otherwise via the Site (e.g., without limitation, state, country, position, industry or title) (" **Non-Identifying Information** "). We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide services associated with the Site and administer your inquiries. We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Palo Alto Networks Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Site and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a communication to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Palo Alto Networks newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "user preferences" information.

We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
