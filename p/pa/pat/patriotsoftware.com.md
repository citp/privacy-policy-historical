The following statements provide additional details about our privacy commitment.

**General Information and Disclosure of Information Received from Website Visitors.**  
We gather information about our website visitors collectively, tracking such things as pages visited, number of searches performed, keywords used in searches, etc. We only use this information anonymously and in the aggregate. This information allows us to create a better overall experience for you by gauging the level of traffic, speed, and overall performance of our Web site. We may share this information, in the aggregate, with our vendors and advertisers to help them better understand our Web site and the services we offer.

**User Specific Information for Patriot Software Users And Their Employees.**  
Patriot Software gathers information from our users that is necessary to perform the selected business tasks that we are obliged to perform on pursuant to the terms and conditions of our Client Services Agreement. All company and personal information is kept confidential.

**Who does Patriot Software share my information with?**  
Patriot Software will not share users’ information with any third parties who do not have a legitimate business need to know and/or have not been authorized to receive the information. Obviously, the information relative to a given user’s employees will be shared with that user. However, no information about a given user or any of their employees will be “cross-shared” with any other Patriot Software user. Website visitors can opt out of direct communications (emails, phone calls, etc.) from Patriot Software at any time.

**How does Patriot Software keep my information private?**  
Patriot Software systems reside on a secure server that encrypts your personal and company information using Secure Socket Layers. You can verify that your information is on our secure server by looking for two things: (1) the padlock icon in the bottom status bar of your browser, and (2) the “s” after “http” in the address line in your browser (example: https://login.patriosoftware.com). You may only access the system by a unique User ID and Password. Employees of users who are using Patriot Software will only have access to their own information; and, users will only have access to their own company information, and information pertaining to their own employees.

After we receive your information, we safeguard the data with both physical and electronic security measures.
