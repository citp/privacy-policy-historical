    * protect the rights, property or safety of EMIS, our customers, or others;

  * It is to a third party performing services on our behalf (and who may only use such information to provide services that We have requested and not for any other purpose), for example, third party companies that provide analytical services so that We can better understand our users and so tailor the services that We provide.



## HOW AND WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

The data that We collect from you will be processed (which includes storing it) in accordance with our obligations under the relevant laws (including, the Data Protection Act 1998) which set out our obligations as someone that has personal data within our possession and control.

Sometimes We use other organisations to process your personal information on our behalf, for example, in relation to the feedback surveys on our Website. We may use service providers to help us run the Website or services available on the Website, some of whom may be based outside the EEA. However, it is our responsibility to ensure that if We use any such service provider then such processing must comply with appropriate security measures (including, that if any personal data is sent outside of the EEA then We need to ensure that it is properly protected). We may also independently audit these service providers to ensure that they meet our standards.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although We will do our best to protect your personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to the Website; any transmission that you make is therefore made at your own risk. However, once We have received your data, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent any unauthorised or unlawful access to the same and all information you provide to us is stored securely.

## YOUR RIGHTS

We will respect your privacy. You will receive emails only from Patient. It will be made clear to you the choices which are available to you regarding any communications you may receive from us, for example, by selecting the relevant options in the user control panel you are able to decide whether you wish to receive newsletters or partner messages, or you can follow the link to unsubscribe included in any email.

We may, however, nevertheless email you occasionally with information or queries about your registration, your subscription account, your Website activity or postings, for example, with reminders, confirmations, warnings or copyright requests.

You have the right at any time to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to limit or prevent such processing by selecting an option to unsubscribe in any relevant communication and you can also control your preferences at any time from your account page at [https://auth.patient.info/my-account](https://auth.patient.co.uk/my-account), or by contacting us.

Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy policies and that We do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies (and how they may be applied) or for any personal data that may be collected through those third party websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check the relevant third party policies before you provide any personal data to those websites or use their services.

Where We have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password information with anyone.

## ACCESS TO INFORMATION

You have the right to access certain information held about you. You can use your right of access in line with the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998 ( **DPA** ) by making a “ _subject access request_ ”.

If you would like to make a subject access request then you must make that request in writing to the address provided below. Any access request may be subject to you paying a reasonable fee (as notified to you upon your request) to help meet our costs in providing you with details of the information We hold about you (this fee will not be greater than that allowed by the DPA).

If We do hold personal data relating to you then following a subject access request We will (subject to certain limited exceptions provided for under the DPA): (i) describe it to you; (ii) tell you why We are holding it; (iii) tell you who it could be disclosed to; and (iv) let you have a copy of it.

If you wish to delete or correct any personal data held by us then you may ask us to do so by sending a request to: Patient Info Website Data Request, Rawdon House, Green Lane, Yeadon, Leeds LS19 7BY or via this form <http://www.patient.info/feedback.asp?ref=/privacy-policy> and We will consider your request and respond accordingly.
