Each research opportunity will be subject to particular terms dependent on the scope of the project and the information to be collected and so if you did want to become involved with a particular opportunity then we will provide you with the necessary details at the relevant time which would include details as to how the data you submit is to be processed. We will ensure that any data which is collected in connection with any research opportunity is processed in compliance with any applicable laws, this privacy policy and any particular terms detailed in respect of the relevant project.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

## BASIS ON WHICH WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA

Like most businesses we may rely on a range of legal bases in order to ensure that our use your personal data is lawful, including:

  * Where it is needed to provide you with our products or services, such as:
  *     * updating your records, contacting you about the relevant product or service (where appropriate);
    * sharing your personal data with service providers in order to deliver the relevant product or service;
    * activities relevant to managing the relevant product or service including any enquiries you may make regarding the product or service, your application to receive the relevant product or service, and the administration and management of accounts;
  * Where it is in our legitimate interests to do so (provided this is not overridden by considerations regarding your rights and interests), such as:
  *     * managing the products and services, updating your records, contacting you about the relevant product or service (where appropriate);
    * performing and/or testing the performance of, our products, services and internal processes;
    * following guidance and recommended best practice of government and regulatory bodies;
    * managing and auditing our business operations;
    * monitoring and to keeping records of our communications with you;
    * undertaking market research and analysis and developing statistics;
    * for direct marketing communication purposes to help us to offer you relevant products and services (this includes the use of cookies or similar technologies to collect and store information when you interact with the Website in order that we can provide you with more relevant advertisements). Note that where we require consent for direct marketing purposes (for example to send you electronic communications), we will ask for this consent separately and clearly.; and/or
    * complying with any relevant legal and/or regulatory obligations;
  * to comply with our legal obligations; and/or
  * with your (explicit) consent (though with the exception of some direct marketing communications it is not likely that We would be relying upon this ground).



## OPTING OUT OF EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS

Subject to the points below relating to service, security and safety communications you have the right at any time to opt out from receiving email communications from us by either following the instructions to unsubscribe included in any communication which we send to you by email or by adjusting your preferences in your user control panel.

Please note that we may need, from time to time, to contact you via email in order to highlight important changes to the Website, to our services, our terms of use or this privacy notice or for security or safety purposes. We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data for these purposes (as we cannot provide certain services without having the ability to communicate with you in this way) and so if you do not wish for us to contact you about such matters then you will need to delete your account (please note that you will then be unable to use those features of the Website or services which require you to be a registered user).

## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * in order to:
    * enforce or apply the Terms of Use and other agreements or to investigate potential breaches of the same; and/or
    * protect the rights, property or safety of Patient, our customers, or others;
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request;
  * if it is to a third party performing services on our behalf (and who may only use such information to provide services that we have requested and not for any other purpose), for example, third party companies that provide analytical services so that we can better understand our users and so tailor the services that we provide;
  * in connection with a potential sale or transfer of part or all of our business. In such circumstances we may share information with prospective purchasers (for example as part of a controlled due diligence exercise); and/or
  * if we reorganise our business as we may need to transfer information about you to another member of our group of companies so that we could continue to provide services to you.



## HOW AND WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

The personal data that we collect from you will be processed (which may incude, where relevant, storing it) in accordance with our obligations under the relevant laws which set out our obligations as someone that has personal data within our possession and control (typically referred to as a ‘data controller’).

We will retain a record of your personal data in accordance with relevant law and the following criteria:

  * where we have a reasonable business need to do so, for example, in order to manage our relationship with you;
  * where we are providing products and/or services to you and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us in respect of those products or services; and/or
  * in line with any legal and regulatory requirements or guidance in respect of retention periods.



As noted above, We sometimes we use other organisations to process your personal information on our behalf, for example, in relation to the feedback surveys on our Website. We may use service providers to help us run the Website or services available on the Website, some of whom may be based outside the EEA. However, it is our responsibility to ensure that if we use any such service provider then we will ensure that we have the necessary safeguards in place. We may also independently audit these service providers to ensure that they meet our standards.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to the Website; any transmission that you make is therefore made at your own risk. However, once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent any unauthorised or unlawful access to the same and all information you provide to us is held at our offices, (where relevant) those of other members of our group of companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above. We also hold your personal data in secure data centres in the UK with all reasonable technological and operational measures put in place to safeguard it from unauthorised access.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Website or services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password information with anyone.

 **Third party sites and links**

Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers or other third parties (for example, we include links below to the site of the Information Commissioner’s Office).

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them will have their own privacy notices, policies and terms of use and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for the same (and how they may be applied) or for any personal data that may be collected through those third party websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check the relevant third party terms, notices and policies before you provide any personal data to those websites or use their services.

 **Children**

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Website is not designed or intended to attract or be used by children under the age of 13. We do not collect any personal data in relation to any individual that we know is under the age of 13.

Individuals who are over the age of 13 but under the age of 16 may register to use the forums but, as noted in our Terms of Use, if you are under 16 you need to get permission from a parent or guardian before providing us with any personal details and use of any of our interactive services by such persons is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian.

We advise parents who permit their children to use any interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.

 **Your rights**

You have a number of important legal rights regarding the manner in which personal data relating to you is used. You can find more information about your rights on the [Information Commissioner’s Office website.](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/)

You have the right to access certain information held about you so that you can be aware of, and verify the lawfulness of, the processing we undertake.

You can exercise your right of access by making what is generally referred to as a 'subject access request'.

 **Right to have information corrected**

If you identify that any personal data that we hold about you is wrong, inaccurate or out of date then you may ask us to correct or update it. Please contact us via the details provided below and we will review each request and respond accordingly.

 **Right to stop or limit our processing of your personal data**

This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. You have the right to require us to stop or to limit any processing we are undertaking in respect of your personal data if we no longer have a valid reason to do so or if we have held it for too long.

This is not an absolute right but every request we receive will be considered carefully and we will respond accordingly (providing grounds for any decision we make).

 **Right to withdraw consent**

You are free to withdraw any consent which you have given to us in relation to our use of your personal data at any time. As noted above, you have the right to tell us to stop sending you any direct marketing materials at any time. Please note that not all uses which we make of your personal data require your consent (for example, if we need to use that information in order to provide a service you have requested then we do not need your consent in order to do so).
