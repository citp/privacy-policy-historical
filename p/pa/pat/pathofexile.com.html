By making use of any of the Website, Materials and Services, you are deemed to have read and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, our Privacy Notice and our Cookies Notice. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, our Privacy Notice or our Cookies Notice, you are not authorised to access and use the Website, Materials and Services, and you must immediately stop doing so.</p></li>

For the avoidance of doubt, and to the greatest extent permitted at law, the Rights include without limitation all rights in respect of all graphics, logos, text, images and all other elements included in and deriving from the gameplay and virtual world featured in PoE, including without limitation in-game names, characters, locations and any virtual items (“Virtual Items”) and their associated benefits or properties acquired or provided for use within PoE.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Amendments to PoE:</strong>&nbsp;Grinding Gear Games at all times retains the right to deal with the Rights as Grinding Gear Games at its sole discretion deems appropriate, including without limitation the right without notice to alter, modify, redesign, suspend or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Website, Materials (including without limitation the Virtual Items) and Services.</p></li>

For the further avoidance of doubt, pursuant to clause 4, any rights you may have in respect of any elements or aspects of PoE (including without limitation in respect of the in-game characters and Virtual Items) are strictly limited to a personal ‘licence to use’ such as part of the Licence and at no time do you acquire any ownership rights in respect of such. Any contravention by you of these Terms of Use or any other terms or conditions notified to you by Grinding Gear Games or any behaviour which Grinding Gear Games deems in its sole discretion is not in keeping with the intended spirit of participation in PoE, immediately terminates the Licence, or such aspect of the Licence as Grinding Gear Games may otherwise provide you notice of.

    <li><p><strong>International transfer of data:</strong> The personal data Grinding Gear Games collects in relation to the Website, Materials and/or Services may be transferred to, and stored in, a country operating outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

    <p>Some of the personal data Grinding Gear Games collects is processed in New Zealand (where its registered office is located).

    <p>Some of the personal data Grinding Gear Games collects is processed by us and/or third-party data processors in other countries, including the United States. These third-party data processors are set out at <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/third-parties">www.pathofexile.com/third-parties</a>. For personal data processed in the United Sates, the European Commission has determined that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU to organisations in the United States under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. Grinding Gear Games has verified that its United States-based data processors have self-certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework or that it has entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as published by the European Commission with its third-party processors. The Standard Contractual Clauses provide specific guarantees around transfers of personal data and Grinding Gear Games rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses in transferring personal data to these third-party processors.</p>
