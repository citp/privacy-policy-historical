## What is the Green Business Program?

The Green Business Program is a successful partnership of environmental agencies and utilities that assists, recognizes and promotes businesses and government agencies that volunteer to operate in a more environmentally responsible way. To be certified "green," participants must be in compliance with all regulations and meet program standards for conserving resources, preventing pollution and minimizing waste. We offer motivated businesses and agencies an easy-to-use framework for improving environmental performance. Over 1500 businesses and public agencies have been certified since 1996 bay area wide and over 330 of those are in Santa Clara County.

## What is Spare the Air Program?

The Spare the Air Program was established by the The Bay Area Air Quality Management District in 1991 to reduce air pollution and provide advance notice when a "Spare the Air Alert" is in effect. The Air District declares Spare the Air Alerts on days when air quality is forecast to exceed federal standards.
