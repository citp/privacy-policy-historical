**Links.**  Our Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources. These links are for your convenience only and are not under our control. You acknowledge and agree that BN Media is not responsible for such external Web sites or resources, and neither BN Media nor our Site endorses any such Web site, its use or contents and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such Web sites or resources. You agree that neither BN Media nor our Site shall be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage, viruses or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on such external Web sites or resources. In the event you decide to access or use any of these other Web sites or resources, you agree you do so at your own risk.

**Safety Tips.**  Our Site makes it easy to express yourself, connect with friends and make new ones, but please remember that what you post could embarrass you or expose you to danger. Here are some common sense guidelines that you should follow when using our Site and the Public Areas on our Site:

  * Don't forget that your profile and the Site's forums are public spaces. Don't provide Member Content to others or post anything you wouldn't want the world to know (e.g., your phone number, address, IM screen name, or specific whereabouts). Avoid posting anything that would make it easy for a stranger (or anyone else you may not want) to find you.
  * If you feel someone's behavior is inappropriate, illegal or offensive, react. Report it to our Site or the authorities.
  * Don't mislead people into thinking that you're older or younger or are someone you are not.
  * Don't get hooked by a phishing scam. Phishing is a method commonly used by criminals to obtain personal information, such as your username and password, by pretending to be a Web site or a company that you trust.



You agree that neither BN Media nor our Site shall be responsible or liable, either directly or indirectly, for Member Content you provide or make available or any thing you post or of the consequences of your actions. In the event you decide to reveal information about yourself or others that may expose you to danger or any harm you do so at your own risk.

**Marketing & Contact Preferences/Opt-out /Updating or Removing Information.** At various points during the Member registration process, you may be asked to indicate your willingness to allow us to communicate with you, share Personal Information collected online with third parties that are not related to our Site, or receive updates or notifications regarding the Site. We will honor your preferences, except as necessary to communicate with you regarding our Terms of Use, including this Privacy Policy, transactions or your Member profile, Member Content, postings or for customer service purposes (e.g., in response to your inquiries). At any time, however, you may (a) stop the receipt of a promotional email by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in any promotional emails we send you, or (b) change your email preferences. Please allow BN Media a reasonable time to modify your preferences. Even after removal of PII and User Content by you or BN Media, PII and User Content may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if another User has stored your User Content.

**Security.**  We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission which is wireless or mobile or over the Internet is completely secure, we have and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information. Unfortunately, no Internet transaction is 100% secure, but we attempt to take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. However, the Site cannot insure or warrant the security of that information.

Member accounts on our Site are secured by Member-created passwords. Our Site takes precautions to insure that Member account information is kept private. We restrict access to Member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.

SSL, an industry standard, is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. Since any information you provide to us on the Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to make a purchase on our Site. The most recent versions of Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer® andChrome can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft website respectively.

Additionally, as outlined in our DPAs (Data Processing Agreements) with third-party processors, BN Media will also be notified promptly by our third-party data processors of any breach of their systems so we can notify users immediately.

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information our Site Collects**. We have the rights to use any information you voluntarily submit to us. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose Personal Information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, request from law enforcement or other legal process received by our Site, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce our Site's Terms of Use or to protect our rights; (3) to protect the safety of the public, our personnel, users of the Site, Members and/or others; and/or (4) as disclosed or notified to you, whether in our Terms of Use, including, this Privacy Policy, or otherwise on or in connection with your use of our Site.
