**WHAT WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION**

We may use personal information in order to display custom, personalized content to our visitors and send newsletters, emails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our service, respond to any problems that may arise and to gauge user trends to determine what part of our services are most popular with users.

We may extend offers to users on behalf of our partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but we will never give out your name or personal information at any time without your permission. 

We allow users of our Web site to send articles or links by email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses (unless you are a user who already has voluntarily provided your email address) of either the sender or receipt of such articles or links after they are sent. 

We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request (e.g., subpoenas); to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation. 

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online (whether through Path2USA’s services or any other services available online), personal or otherwise, that information could be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat forums, bulletin boards, and you post your e-mail or id, you may receive unsolicited messages form others. Path2USA has no control over this use of your personal information.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
