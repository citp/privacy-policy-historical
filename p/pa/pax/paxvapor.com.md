PAX Labs holds our customer base in the highest regards and is dedicated to providing the best experience on paxvapor.com. In order to offer an enjoyable and premium experience on our website it is necessary to collect aggregate and personal information.

Account creation is required when purchasing tobacco products, but we do recommend all visitors create an online account and sign up for PAX Labs’ newsletter. With the creation of your account and/or Newsletter subscription we collect your name, date of birth, e-mail address, billing address and shipping address. By providing this information you will save time when ordering products and will receive exclusive offers where legally permitted.

#### Use of Information Collected

PAX Labs utilizes information that is collected in various ways. Information collected helps our efforts to advance our customers’ and visitors’ online experience when visiting paxvapor.com. This ranges from accessibility, improving content, customer service, shopping checkout experience and overall website satisfaction.

When signing up for our Newsletter and exclusive offers we will use information gathered to send these communications electronically.

We use various third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf. It may become necessary to share information with such entities; however, this is only done so when those entities are performing functions solely on our behalf and they are not permitted to store such information except as needed to perform our work or as required by law.  Further, we require such third parties to protect your personal information. 

If PAX Labs is acquired by or merged with another company, all of our assets, including information that has been collected, will be transferred to the new entity.

The products sold on this website are highly regulated by various governing agencies. It may become necessary to share the information that we collect with such agencies to comply with laws, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal requests.

We also may disclose information that has been collected where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud and/or counterfeit, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which PAX Labs is involved.

#### Age Verification

The products that we sell on our website are highly regulated and age-restricted. We are required and committed to preventing sales to anyone under the legal tobacco purchasing age. We will only send you marketing materials and information after you have certified that 1) you are a tobacco consumer of legal tobacco purchasing age; 2) that you wish to be added to our mailing list for the purpose of receiving offers and advertising from a tobacco company; and 3) that you understand that providing false information may constitute a violation of the law. 

Before we add you to our mailing list, we will verify your age through a non-affiliated third party company, Veratad Technologies, LLC, to perform an age and identify verification check for adherence to this requirement. We utilize Veratad’s AgeMatch and IDMatch Verification services to perform these checks. Veratad uses billons of records from multiple trusted data sources to verify the information that you provide and ensure that you qualify to access and purchase products from paxvapor.com. This process has been developed with the customer’s privacy in mind, and checks are secure with detailed information neither shared nor accessible.

In some cases Veratad might not be able to verify your age and/or identity through their verification service. If you are unable to verify your age, you will be requested to upload a copy of your government ID that our support team can manually verify your date of birth. Photo ID's are uploaded to Veratad's secure database and all files are deleted within 72 hours or less. 

#### Children’s Privacy

This website is not intended for nor targeted at children under the legal tobacco purchasing age. Despite this fact, we are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who may access our website. Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information for anyone under the age of 13 years old without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, he or she should contact us immediately.
