## Privacy Policy

### Overview

Panabee takes your privacy seriously. We respect and protect the privacy of our users and take appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information. This privacy policy (the "Policy") explains the types of personal information that we receive and collect when you use the Panabee website ("Site") or the services offered by Panabee ("Services"). If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at info @ panabee.com. 

### What Information Panabee Collects

When you sign up for a Panabee account, we ask you for personal information, such as your name and email address. You'll be asked to create a password for your Panabee account. When you provide friends' email addresses and the services they use, we may store these in order to provide Services to you, though we attempt not to unless necessary. When you invite friends to Panabee or send messages through Panabee, we may collect and maintain information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content. Again, we only store the information if needed. 

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters. This information is sent to your computer when you use Panabee, and it's stored on your computer so that we can uniquely identify a user's browser. We use cookies to store user preferences and track user trends. Because Panabee is entirely personalized, your browser must accept cookies for us to provide our Services to you. 

#### Contents Of Entries

The contents of any data that you post directly to the Site, including any text, images, photos, videos and audio, are stored and maintained on our servers in order to publish these items and provide the Service. Your submitted content will be associated with your account. 

#### User Communications

When you send email or other communication to Panabee, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. 

#### Non-Personally-Identifying Data

This is information that is commonly made available by web browsers and servers, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Panabee uses this information to better understand how visitors use our website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in Panabee usage. 

### Uses

We maintain and process your personal information in order to provide your Panabee account and access. When you send messages or invitations through Panabee, your name, email address and personal Panabee URL are identified in the message. We store passwords for third-party services if it is required by that service to display the information on Panabee. We do this in order to provide Services to you. We do not store passwords for third-party sites when you provide them. In addition to the above, Panabee may process personal information for such purposes as: sending you information related to your Panabee account or other Panabee services; auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and developing new services. Panabee processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifying information you enter into the Site will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Site and our Services. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States. 

### Choices For Personal Information

You may delete data through Panabee, and this will take immediate effect in your account view. Residual copies of deleted entries remain in our database to keep them from accidentally reappearing. 

### Information Sharing

In addition to the uses noted above, Panabee only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Panabee in the following limited circumstances: (1) We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. (2) We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Panabee, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. If Panabee becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

### Information Security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Panabee employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

### Data Integrity

Panabee processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

### Accessing and updating personal information

When you use Panabee, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. 

### Links to Third Party Sites

This Policy only applies to the Panabee website and services. We do not exercise control over the sites that our service links to. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and Panabee and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personally-identifying information by any third party. 

### Enforcement

Panabee regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Panabee's treatment of personal information by contacting us at info @ panabee.com. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Panabee's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Panabee and an individual. 

### Policy Changes

This Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.
