# Privacy Policy - Panasonic Australia

Panasonic Australia Pty Limited (Panasonic) is committed to protecting your privacy.

All information gathered by Panasonic will be stored securely.

### Collection and Use of Information

The information Panasonic collects about website users will be used only for research and permission based marketing activities. Findings from research will be reported in aggregate form to Panasonic and its related entities.

Panasonic does not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us such as filling out a form or survey, entering competitions, promotions or similar. Personally identifiable information includes names addresses, phone, fax or email addresses. Any personal information collected on our site will state to the user that personal information is being collected.

We do not wish to obtain personal information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personal information.

It is our policy to send e-mail only to consumers who give us permission to do so. In every such e-mail we will have instructions on how you may unsubscribe from the e-mail list. From this point your information will be deleted from our database.

Those who request information and request receipt of continuing marketing and other information from Panasonic, will occasionally receive e-mail communications to provide information which we think you will find useful/beneficial, including information about new products and services.

### Disclosure of Information

Panasonic will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

However, we may share information with external companies, usually during competitions, promotions or similar. These external companies shall be bound by Panasonic's privacy policy. In addition, agreements shall be in place to ensure our policy is adhered to.

### Review and Removal of your Personally Identifiable Data

Panasonic respects your right to access personal information we have collected about you at any time and make changes you deem appropriate.

Personal details can be changed at any time by contacting the Privacy Officer by E-Mail at [privacyofficer@panasonic.com.au](mailto:privacyofficer@panasonic.com.au) or by mail to the 'Privacy Officer, Panasonic Australia Pty. Limited, Locked Bag 505, Frenchs Forest NSW 2086'.

Panasonic accepts your right to opt out of any consumer research Panasonic has/is conducting at any time.

### Cookies and Other Tracking Methods

We track traffic patterns throughout the URL's (web-sites) registered to Panasonic. Panasonic may use a feature of your browser called a 'cookie'. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out your identity or the identities of any of our users - they only identify your computer to our servers when you visit our site.

Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site, to help you navigate a website as easily as possible.

### Security

We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorised access. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data.

### Amendments

Amendments to this policy will be posted on this web-site and will be effective when posted.
