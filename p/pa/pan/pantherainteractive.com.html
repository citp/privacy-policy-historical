  <p><strong>Updated March 1, 2007</strong></p>
    <p>This privacy statement covers the site www.PantheraInteractive.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices.</p>


     <h3>Information Collection</h3>
    <p> Panthera Interactive ("Company") is the sole owner of the information collected on www.PantheraInteractive.com. The Company collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>
    
     <h3>Information Use</h3>
    <p><strong>Profile:</strong> We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to help us target and deliver more targeted advertisement to end users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing dislikes/likes of any ads. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers more relevant to them. This profile is used enhance a level of targeting for the end user, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our ad server. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
        
        
                <p><strong>Third Party Advertising:</strong> The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by DirectTrack. Information about users' visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by DirectTrack only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or ad servers. </p>



        <p><strong>Log Files:</strong> Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. We use a tracking utility called Wedbtrends that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>



        <p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs):</strong> We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.company.com", which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company.

In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.</p>



        <p><strong>Special Offers and Updates:</strong> We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. </p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Newsletter:</strong> If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy. we provide a way to opt-out of these communications</p>
        
        
        
        <p><strong> Service Announcements:</strong> On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
        
        
        
        <p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes. </p>


    <h3>Sharing</h3>
    
          <p><strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable):</strong> We share aggregated demographic information with our advertisers</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Third Party Advertisers:</strong>  The Company shares Web site usage information for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on various sites. For example, [XYZ Company] uses cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information they collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Business Transitions:</strong>  In the event the Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email as well as a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Links:</strong>  This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Panthera Interactive, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong> Refer-a-Publisher:</strong>  If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our network, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. The Company will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. The Company stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact the Company at help@PantheraInteractive.com to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Notification of Changes:</strong>  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Any posted changes will take effect immediately. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
