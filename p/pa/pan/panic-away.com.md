This website routinely collects information about its visitors‚ subscribers‚ members‚ and customers. This information is obtained in various ways‚ such as:

VISITOR‚ SUBSCRIBER‚ MEMBER‚ OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ‘REGISTRATION’  
Registration means that the Visitor‚ Subscriber‚ Member or Customer takes active‚ positive steps to communicate information to this website. This can include pages or ‘pop ups’ where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email‚ mail‚ or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization‚ paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.

Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill–in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing. This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.

ONLINE ORDERING  
Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering‚ the customer provides‚ name‚ address‚ city‚ state‚ email address‚ phone number‚ CVV2 (back of card) number‚ and‚ occasionally a member password. You should consider all this information available to the website. This information is used to deliver the product‚ but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.
