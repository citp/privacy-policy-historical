We may collect Personal Information about you in the following general situations when you:

  * visit our Websites
  * register through one of our Websites with us
  * communicate with us, including in-person and on the phone or upload user content
  * respond to marketing promotions that we offer



In most instances, you will be unable to use our Websites and communicate with us without disclosing some Personal Information to us.

**Types of Information we collect**  
Similar to other websites, we automatically receive and record information from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, information from your browser, web beacons, pixel tags, social media buttons, third-party cookie information, URL links, and other methods when you visit any of our Websites. Information that you post or communicate via our Websites is collected by us and we ask for information such as your name, title, company name, job description, expertise, zip code/postal address, telephone number, or email address and other information when you register with us. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include, for instance, browser and device information; App usage data; information collected through cookies, email tracking, pixel tags, web analytics services and other technologies; and other information provided by you; or aggregated information. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Sites and for other purposes described below. We also collect Personal Information about prospective business partners and customers from our Partners and other sources. Notwithstanding the foregoing, although some information automatically collected is not solely personally identifiable, our Partners or us may combine such information with information from third party sources and combining such information from these sources could make anonymous information identifiable as Personal Information or supplement the Personal Information we previously have about you.

**Sharing Information with Certain Third Parties**  
We only share your Personal Information as described in this policy. We may share certain Personal Information with certain third parties like strategic partners and vendors with whom we work under confidentiality agreements for certain particular purposes. Nevertheless, these third parties do not have any independent right to share your information with third parties or use it for other purposes. Panopto, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates are located in different countries around the world and by accessing our Websites, your information may be transferred outside of your local jurisdiction. We may display certain advertisements based on Personal Information. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits residents of California that use our Websites to request certain information regarding disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To the extent you wish to make such a request, please send an email to us at [legal@panopto.com](mailto:legal@panopto.com) with “California Civil Code Privacy Rights” in the subject line.

**Minors**  
Our Websites are not intended for minors. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received or collected Personal Information pertaining to a minor under the age of consent in the country where the child is located without consent, we will delete such information from our records.

**Cookies and Other Similar Technologies**  
We may set and access our cookies on your computer and access and other technologies that tell us how you interact with us via our Websites, e-mails, and other technologies when you visit our Websites. Most Internet browsers have options for deleting, controlling and disabling or deleting cookies on your computer.

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the Sites. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. Our Websites use both 1st party cookies (which are set by the websites being visited) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our Websites). Essential cookies enable you to navigate our Websites and to use their services and features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, our Websites will not perform as smoothly for you, and we may not be able to provide access to our Websites or certain services or features. Analytics cookies collect information about your use of our Websites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our Websites, help us record any difficulties you have with our Websites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on our Websites, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze our Websites traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. Advertising cookies are set to display targeted promotions or advertisements based upon your interests on our Websites or to manage our advertising. These cookies collect information about your activities on this and other sites to provide you targeted advertising. When you fill out a form on our Websites (including but not limited to the free trial form, contact us form, and white paper forms), a visitor cookie is set in order to remember your preferences such as form field values and visited web pages. We use a third-party marketing automation tool to set visitor cookies. Depending on the country from which you visit our website, you may receive a message at the bottom of the page on your first visit notifying you of our use of cookies. By continuing to use our Websites without changing the cookie settings of your browser, you are opting in to our use of cookies. You may refuse or accept cookies from our Websites at any time by activating settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of our Websites may operate as intended.

**Correcting or Removing Information Panopto Has Collected**  
If you feel that any Personal Information about you that has been collected and stored by Panopto is incorrect, or if you want Personal Information about you removed from our systems, please notify us at [data-protection@panopto.com](mailto:data-protection@panopto.com) so that we may respond to your request in accordance with applicable law. You may also request access to your Personal Information held by Panopto by sending a request to data-protection@panopto.com. For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable, subject to applicable law. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion. You can always opt not to disclose information. However, if you elect to do so, we may be limited in responding to your inquiry or providing services to you.

You may opt-out of receiving marketing messages from Panopto by sending an email to [unsubscribe@panopto.com](mailto:unsubscribe@panopto.com), or by unsubscribing through the “unsubscribe or opt-out link” in an email. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if you are a Panopto Video Platform user you will continue to receive certain communications pertaining to the video platform such as service announcements and administrative messages even if you opt out of marketing communications from Panopto. While we will attempt to comply with any request pertaining to your Personal Information in accordance with applicable law, please be aware that we may not be able to fulfill requests pertaining to information already shared with third parties. Some information may be maintained on our systems for recordkeeping purposes, and some residual digital information cannot be removed or changed to the extent permitted by applicable law. We ask that you not send us or disclose any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Sites or via other means.

**Legal Matters**  
Panopto may preserve and has the right to disclose without your prior permission any information about you or your use of our Websites if Panopto has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Panopto employees, other users of our Websites, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of our Websites, or (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.  
Permitted Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties  
We do not disclose, share or sell Personal Information about you with third parties except under the following circumstances:

  * When we need to exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims, or when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding data breaches, suspected fraud, illegal activities, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.panopto.com/terms-of-service), or as otherwise required by law.
  * We may transfer your Personal Information if we are acquired by or merged with another company, to ensure the continuity of our business and services. In such an event, we will make a public notice announcement before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * When we have permission from you to provide you with services you have requested and as needed to carry out your instructions.

Your information (including Personal Information) may be retained by us for any lawfully permitted period of time, and as necessary to comply with the legal and contractual obligations of our organization, enforce our agreements, and enable us to various investigate events and resolve disputes.

**Panopto Discussion Forums and Social Media**  
If you participate in any of our discussion forums, blogs, social media, message boards, chat, profile pages and/or other parts of our Websites that allow you to post your comments, you should be aware that the information you provide there may appear in public ways such as through search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. We monitor such media and we reserve the right to remove any content at our discretion. As with most such media forums, each participant’s opinion on a blog or discussion forum is that of the specific participant’s. Please do not post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.

**Security of Information**  
Information collected through our Websites is or may be processed and stored in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, by providing information to Panopto through the use of our Websites you are consenting to the transfer of the information to the United States for processing in accordance with this policy. We have in place significant physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, use, and maintain. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We ask that you do your part by maintaining in strict confidence any computer passwords you use to access the Internet or our Websites.

Please contact us at [data-protection@panopto.com](mailto:data-protection@panopto.com) to learn more about security, including the security measures we have taken and steps you can take to improve the security of your information when using our Websites.
