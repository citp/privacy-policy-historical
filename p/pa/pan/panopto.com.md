# Privacy and Cookie Policy | Panopto Video Platform

Panopto, Inc. (“ **Panopto** ” or “we”) is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we use and treat information that we receive from you when you visit our website, subscribe to our newsletter, download our white papers and case studies, or sign-up for our free trial.

This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through the website operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Domain”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Apps”), through our social media pages and apps ( the “Social Media Pages”), and other services provided by us both online and offline; as well as through email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Domain, the Apps and the Social Media Pages, the “ **Sites** ”). “ **You** ” or a “ **user** ” refers to any individual who visits or otherwise uses the Sites. By using the Sites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that we receive from existing customers. Such information is governed by the terms of the applicable software license and services agreement, rather than this Privacy Policy.

**What Types of Information Does Panopto Collect?**

_Personal Information_. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job description, expertise, zip code/postal address, telephone number, or email address.

_Other Information_. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include, for instance, browser and device information; App usage data; information collected through cookies, email tracking, pixel tags, and other technologies; and other information provided by you; or aggregated information. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Sites and for other purposes described below.

_IP Address_. Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. Panopto uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems with its servers, and administer the Sites.

**How Does Panopto Collect Information?**

**Personal Information.** We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:

_Through the Sites_ : We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, e.g., when you request a free trial or demo, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. white papers).

_Offline_ : We may collect Personal Information from you offline during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer service.

_Information from Other Sources_ : In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.

**Other Information.** We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

_Through Your Browser or Device_ : Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), operating system name and version, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Sites (such as the Apps) you are using.

_Through Your Use of the Apps_ : When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

_Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies_ : Cookies and other similar technologies may be used to collect Other Information. Please review our Cookies Policy below for more information.

_Through email_ : Once you have opted in to receive email from us regarding the Apps, the Sites and related information, we and our service providers may collect open and click-through information each time you open or click on our email.

_Through Web analytics services_ : Panopto uses Google Analytics.

Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze how users use the Domain. The information generated about Domain usage is transmitted to Google in the U.S. This information is used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Domain, compile statistical reports on Domain activity, and provide other services related to the Site and Internet use. Google may also collect information about Domain visitors’ use of other websites. For more information about Google Analytics, or to opt out of Google Analytics, please go to: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>

_By Aggregating Information_ : Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites.

**Panopto Cookie Policy**

What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the Sites. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

The Sites use both 1st party cookies (which are set by the Site being visited) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of the Sites).

_Essential Cookies_. Essential cookies enable you to navigate our Sites and to use their services and features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the Sites will not perform as smoothly for you, and we may not be able to provide the Sites or certain services or features.

_Analytics Cookies_. Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Sites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Sites, help us record any difficulties you have with the Sites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze the Sites traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information.

_Advertising Cookies_. Advertising cookies are set to display targeted promotions or advertisements based upon your interests on the Sites or to manage our advertising. These cookies collect information about your activities on this and other sites to provide you targeted advertising.

_Visitor Cookies_. When you fill out a form on the Sites (including but not limited to the free trial form, contact us form, and white paper forms), a Visitor Cookie is set in order to remember your preferences such as form field values and visited web pages. We use Pardot, a third-party marketing automation tool, to set Visitor Cookies.

_Opt In_. Depending on the country from which you visit our website, you may receive a message at the top of the page on your first visit requesting permission to track your activities. More details are available in [Tracking Opt-in by Country](http://www.pardot.com/faqs/administration/tracking-opt-in-by-country/). If you click “do not track”, a small cookie is placed on your browser that signals to Pardot, our marketing automation tool, not to record or remember any of your activities while on our site. If you do not have “do not track” settings enabled in your browser and do have JavaScript enabled, your page views and other activities will be tracked on Pardot landing pages and pages on our website that include Pardot tracking code. With tracking enabled, you should not notice anything out of the ordinary other than the fact that we will “remember” the data you submit through our forms. For example, your email address will be prefilled when you return, fields that were already completed will not display again unless they’re set to “always display” in the form, and there may be new conditional fields displaying that you had not viewed before.

**How Can I Manage Cookies?**

You may refuse or accept cookies from the Sites at any time by activating settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. You may wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html> for information on commonly used browsers. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Sites may operate as intended.

  4. To personalize your experience on the Sites.

As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our Affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our Affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

**How Does Panopto Use and Disclose Other Information?**  
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

**Links to Other Sites**

Panopto’s Site may contain links to other sites such as Panopto service products and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

**How Does Panopto Secure Collected Personal Information?**

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access.

Employees who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

**How Can I Correct or Remove Information Panopto Has Collected about Me?**

If you feel that any Personal Information about you that has been collected and stored by Panopto is incorrect, or if you want Personal Information about you removed from our systems, please notify us at [data-protection@panopto.com](mailto:data-protection@panopto.com) so that we may respond to your request in accordance with applicable law. You may also request access to your Personal Information held by Panopto by sending a request to [data-protection@panopto.com](mailto:data-protection@panopto.com).

We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable, subject to applicable law.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.

**Opting Out. What Choices Do I Have?**

You can always opt not to disclose information. However, if you elect to do so, we may be limited in responding to your inquiry or providing services to you.

You may opt-out of receiving marketing messages from Panopto by sending an email to [unsubscribe@panopto.com](mailto:unsubscribe@panopto.com), or by unsubscribing through the “unsubscribe or opt-out link” in an email.

**Sensitive Information**

We ask that you not send us or disclose any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Sites or via other means.

**Legal Matters**

Panopto may preserve and has the right to disclose without your prior permission any information about you or your use of the Sites if Panopto has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) Protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Panopto or its affiliates, employees, other users of the Sites, or the public; (b) Enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of this Site, or (c) Respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.

**Information Storage and Security**

Information collected through the Sites is processed and stored in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, by providing information to Panopto through the use of the Sites you are consenting to the transfer of the information to the United States for processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, use, and maintain. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We ask that you do your part by maintaining in strict confidence any computer passwords you use to access the Internet or the Sites.

**Information Related to Employment**

The Sites may provide an opportunity to submit your resume or an application form to us or apply for a position through the Sites. If you submit information for such purposes, we will use (which may include transferring) the Personal Information you provide to evaluate your qualifications and contact you regarding any positions at Panopto or any of its affiliated companies in which we believe you may be interested.
