# Privacy | Panopto

##  Information Collected

In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site, and to Panopto promotions on other sites. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than Panopto affiliates and contractors who assist Panopto in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.

In addition, there are portions of this Site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address. For electronic access to communications directed to shareholders, for example, annual reports and proxy statements, we collect your tax identification number to verify your shareholder status.

##  Use of Collected Information

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to receive electronic annual reports or other product or service information). This information may be shared with other Panopto businesses, but only if necessary to fulfill your request or for related purposes.

We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are obligated to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).

If you register with one of Panopto's business units online, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about Panopto's offerings in support of your business needs. They may also seek to place a "cookie" (small data file) as discussed above in order to provide you with tailored information.

##  Links to Other Sites

Panopto's Site may contain links to other sites such as Panopto service products and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

##  Security of Collected Information

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those Panopto workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

##  Access to Collected Information

You may review and update the information that you provide to us through this Site by contacting us as described below.

##  Legal Matters

Panopto may preserve and has the right to disclose without your prior permission any information about you or your use of this Site if Panopto has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) Protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Panopto or its affiliates, employees, other users of this Site, or the public; (b) Enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of this Site, or (c) Respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.

##  Information Storage and Security

Information collected through this Site is processed and stored in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, by providing information to Panopto through the use of the Site you are consenting to the transfer of the information to the United States for processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, use, and maintain. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We ask that you do your part by maintaining in strict confidence any computer passwords you use to access the Internet or this Site.

##  Information Related to Employment

This Site may provide an opportunity to submit your resume or an application form to us or apply for a position through this Site. If you submit information for such purposes, we will use (which may include transferring) the Personal Information you provide to evaluate your qualifications and contact you regarding any positions at Panopto or any of its affiliated companies in which we believe you may be interested.

##  Panopto, Inc. Not Interested in Minors

You must be at least 18 years old and possess the legal authority to form legally binding contracts under applicable law to use this Site and the services provided on it. Panopto does not knowingly collect Personal Information from those under the age of 18. In an instance where such information was collected, it would be purely accidental and unintentional. Panopto encourages parents to discuss the Internet with their children and monitor Personal Information that a child may provide via the Internet.
