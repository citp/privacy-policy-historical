## Collection of Information

**Information You Provide to Us**

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, participate in a contest or promotion, make a purchase, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, credit card information, security preferences, and any other information you choose to provide. We also collect your information if you post, display and/or publish user content on the website through the use of cookies (as explained below). Additionally, when you enter any password-protected area of our website, our website will recognize you and collect information that you submit through the use of authentication tokens tied to user accounts created on or through an integrated third-party user database.

**Information About Your Use of the Services**

We collect information about your use of the Services, such as the search terms you enter, your location, financial payment information, and the identity of your devices.

**Automatically Collected Information**

When you access or use our Services or transact business with us, we automatically collect information about you, including:

  * **Transactional Information:** When you make a purchase or return, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and date and location of the transaction.
  * **Log and Usage Information:** We collect log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser and operating system you use, the domain and host from which you access the internet, access times, pages viewed, web browsing history, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
  * **Device Information:** We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and tokens, unique identifier headers, mobile network information, and other information that identifies you as the user of the device or the person providing information to us.
  * **Location Information:** In accordance with your device permissions, we may collect information about the precise location of your device. You have the ability to stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see [Your Choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20190515215649id_/https%3A//na.panasonic.com/us/privacypolicy#8) below for details).
  * **Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:** We use different technologies to collect information, including cookies and plug-ins. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve and keep secure our Services and your experience. Through the use of cookies, we may automatically collect information about your online activity on our website, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Our website uses two types of cookies: (1) “session” cookies which are deleted from your computer when you leave the website and are used purely to help you navigate around the website; and (2) “persistent” cookies which remain on your computer so that the website can recognize you when you return. Plug-ins are pieces of software that users download to allow certain web-based software to operate. In order to use our website, you may be required to install certain plug-ins. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see [Your Choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20190515215649id_/https%3A//na.panasonic.com/us/privacypolicy#8) below.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**

We may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect directly from you. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.

## Use of Information

We use the information we collect to deliver the products and services you request and customize your experience with us, to administer your account, and to target advertisements based on users’ interests and to understand how users interact with ads. We may also use the information we collect to:

  * Analyze the success of our Services;
  * Better understand the needs and interest of our customers;
  * Manage the website’s interactive functionality;

  * With vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf, regardless of whether you have chosen to limit our sharing of your information as collected on our website;
  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
  * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of Panasonic or others;
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;
  * Between and among Panasonic and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership; and

Panasonic requires its vendors, consultants, and service providers that have access to your information to maintain the confidentiality of your information and to comply with the safeguards provided in this privacy policy. We also provide our vendors, consultants, and service providers with our opt-out lists so that communications sent on behalf of Panasonic are not sent to opt-out participants.

Panasonic will not sell, rent, or market your information collected on the website to non-affiliated third parties for their marketing purposes, unless we have received your consent. However, Panasonic may disclose aggregated statistics about visitors to its website, along with anonymous information collected from other sources. We may also share aggregated or de-identified information with third parties (such as advisors, promotional sponsors, and investors), which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for various business purposes, including conducting general business analysis and developing website content and services.

## Social Sharing Features

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

## Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by Panasonic and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.

Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.

Our Cookie Policy sets out details of the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them. The Cookie Policy can be accessed here: [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190515215649id_/https%3A//na.panasonic.com/us/cookie-policy).

We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
