 <ul>
 <li>The purpose of the Pandora® Privacy Policy is to inform our listeners about the information that we collect, how we use that information and how listeners can control how that information is used or shared. To make it a bit easier to digest our Privacy Policy, we want to highlight some key issues to keep in mind about our data collection and use practices. For information about listeners' obligations and use of PANDORA® internet radio, please see our <a href="http://www.pandora.com/legal" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
 <li>You have significant control over the information that is shared with other PANDORA® internet radio users and the public through the privacy settings for your profile.</li>

 <li>We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their marketing purposes.</li>
 <li>Post wisely: Information that you post in our community and social networking features is available to members of the public.</li>
 <li>We use the information that we collect and you provide about yourself to personalize your PANDORA® internet radio experience through ads and social networking features.</li>
 <li>We track the music played on PANDORA® internet radio so that we can make sure artists and copyright owners get paid. We must report on listening in aggregate to music licensing agencies. These reports do not contain individual listener data.</li>
 <li>Your stations are always available to the public; however, if you make your profile private, your profile will not be linked to your station list. Members of the public who enter your email address into our search system may be able to see information about your stations and to listen to them.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>This summary is not the complete picture, so please read the Pandora® Privacy Policy below in its entirety to learn more about the information that we collect, how we use and share this information, and your options to control how that information is used or shared.</p>

 <div class="" align="center">
 <p><b>PANDORA MEDIA, INC.</b><br>
 <b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
 <b>(EFFECTIVE AS OF January 11, 2011)</b></p></div>


 <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 11, 2011, for Pandora Media, Inc. ("Pandora", "we", "us" or "our"). It applies to the United States operations for the PANDORA® internet radio service  (the "Service") that we offer through our website located at www.pandora.com, supported mobile devices, consumer electronics devices and other mechanisms.</p>

 <p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our listeners' needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our website's home page.</p>

 <p><b>The types of information we collect</b></p>

 <p>We have several areas where you can submit information to us, and we also have features that automatically collect information from the listeners of our Service and visitors to our website.</p>

 <p><ins>Information you give us:</ins></p>



 <p>To enable you to enjoy certain features of our Service, we may collect certain types of information, including personally identifiable information, during your interactions with our Service. For example, we may collect information when you:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Register to use our Service;</li>
 <li>Enter information in your Profile Page, including your friends lists;</li>
 <li>Post comments on other Pandora® listeners' pages or use other community and social networking features that are part of our Service;</li>
 <li>Participate in polls, contests, or other features of the Service; and</li>
 <li>Sign up to receive email newsletters.</li>

 </ul>


 <p>When you register, we ask you to provide certain information, which includes (but may not be limited to) your email address, birth year, gender, and zip code, as well as a password for your listener account. If you choose to subscribe to fee-based portions of the Service, you will also be asked to provide your name, credit card information, and zip code. When you contact us by email, we retain the emails that you send to us.</p>


 <p><ins>Information we receive from third parties</ins></p>


 <p>We may receive information about you from third parties and store it in our databases with other information (including personally identifiable information) that you provide to us. Some examples of these third parties are listed below:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Service partners and advertisers that make features available through the Service;</li>

 <li>Service partners through whom we allow registered listeners to access the Service;</li>
 <li>Marketing companies that create professional marketing lists or sell other marketing data;</li>
 <li>Other websites or applications that you have registered to use, or that people you know have registered to use, when we allow those websites or applications to interact through the Service to provide personalized services to you. In some cases, those websites or applications may automatically provide us with information about you to facilitate personalization unless you use the controls available on those websites or applications to opt-out of such sharing.</li>
 </ul>


 <p>Pandora® is not responsible for, and will assume no liability, if a business partner or other entity collects, uses or shares any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.</p>



 <p><ins>Information that we receive from other listeners</ins></p>


 <p>We may collect information about you from people who have stored information about you when they elect to use our social networking or community features, or when they enable connectivity with another website or application where they have stored such information. For instance, your friends may have stored information about you in places such as their friends lists, address books, or photos on our website and other sites with which the Service interacts.</p>


 <p>We may also collect your email address when people you know share a station with you, but we will not add your name to any of our mailing lists as a result of this feature.</p>


 <p><ins>Automatic Data Collection</ins></p>


 <p><em>Copyright Tracking:</em> Pandora® incorporates software that is designed to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to and to ensure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties. This software identifies and counts the songs you have accessed.</p>


 <p><em>Service partners:</em> When you access the Service through a service partner, we may add select aspects of your registration information (such as your email address), so that we can identify which of our service partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the Service.</p>


 <p><em>Information about your computer or device:</em> We may also collect information about the computer, mobile or other devices you use to access and listen to the Service.  For example, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Service from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device.</p>

 <p><em>Tracking technology:</em> We use what are commonly called "cookies," a small data string our server writes to your hard drive, and other tracking technology (such as Flash Persistent Storage) to help us manage and track your interaction with Pandora Services. These technologies collect non-personally identifiable information to improve Pandora Services, including to keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, save your password and login information, and / or display advertising or content based on your interests. We may also capture other data such as search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and IP addresses. Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Service may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.</p>


 <p>Advertisers, and the third-party advertising companies with whom we or our advertisers partner to deliver ads to you, may place or recognize a unique cookie or similar technology on your browser in order to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Service. If you would like more information about this practice and how to control how this information is used by these companies, please follow the links below.</p>

 </ul>


 <p><b>How we use the information we collect:</b></p>


 <p>We use the information that we collect for the following purposes:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>To customize and personalize the advertising and the content you see.</li>
 <li>To enhance the listener experience in our network of websites. We use tracking information to determine how well each page and station performs overall based on aggregate listener demographics and traffic patterns to those pages and stations. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</li>

 <li>To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in and renew paid services, polls, contests, and message boards.</li>
 <li>To send you information that you agreed to receive about topics that we think will be of interest to you.</li>
 <li>To alert you to the latest developments and features on our Service.</li>
 </ul>


 <p><b>How the information we collect is shared:</b></p>


 <p>We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies, websites, applications or people in the circumstances listed below.</p>

 <ul>
 <li>You provide information in the course of your use of the Service by participating in community and social networking features such as forums, station sharing, listener opinions and reviews, or other forms of public communication and interaction. In addition, we also make your stations available to those registered listeners who know your email address and who specifically request your station.</li>
 <li>You elect to allow us to share information at the time that you register with us or provide us with the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election.</li>
 <li>When we hire or partner with third parties to provide specialized services on our behalf, such as credit card processing, sweepstakes management and prize fulfillment, data processing, customer/support services and special products or services that we choose to make available to our registered listeners.</li>
 <li>When you search for artists or listen to stations via the Service. Unless you make your Profile private, information about the artists, songs, and stations you have created or listened to may be made publically available.</li>
 <li>We also may use and share non-personally identifiable information, such as general demographic or location information, or information about the computer or device from which you access the Service. The use and disclosure of such information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may de-identify personally identifiable information and share it in a de-identified or aggregated form with third parties, advertisers and/or business partners in order to analyze Service usage, improve the Pandora Services and your listener experience, or for other similar purposes.</li>
 <li>When we jointly offer certain features or services with third parties, such as service partners that make features available through the Service, business partners through whom we allow registered listeners to access Service, advertisers, or marketing companies. When you use these features or services, you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that service partner. Such third parties may have different data collection, use and sharing practices than us, and you should review their applicable privacy policies.</li>

 <li>When we work with a third party to provide personalization to the Service through connectivity to another website or application. We may also share your information with a third party when we jointly offer a service or a feature with that third party, such as connectivity with other websites.</li>
 <li>If you unsubscribe for a mailing that we send to you on behalf of a third party, we may share your removal instructions with the third party so that your email address may be added to that company's list of people to whom they will not send emails directly.</li>
 <li>In connection with a merger with another entity, or in the event of a transfer of all or some of our assets.</li>
 <li>When we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in a situation where disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to Pandora, our listeners or members of the public.</li>
 </ul>


 <p><ins>How your information may be shared with other listeners and the public</ins></p>


 <p>Unless you make your Profile Page private, information on that page is visible to other listeners and to the public. You may post favorite songs, bookmarks, stations or other biographical information on your Profile Page. When you are making the decision to be public or private, please keep in mind that as a result of our partnerships, including, Facebook's Instant Personalization, some of the people who may be looking at your profile or your activities on the Service may be your Pandora® friends, or your friends on other social networks, including Facebook. In addition, such friends may share information about you with other third parties, including their friends on other social networks.</p>


 <p><b>How we protect your information</b></p>


 <p>We have implemented commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your personally identifiable information. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>


 <p><b>Consent to processing</b></p>

 <p>Use of PANDORA® internet radio outside of the United States is a violation of our <a href="http://www.pandora.com/legal" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff"><ins>Terms of Use</ins></font></a>. Nevertheless, if you use the Service outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in the United States and other countries or territories. The laws on holding personal information in the United States may vary and be less stringent than laws of your state or country.</p>
