This marketing may be completed using data collected about you over time in connection with Programs you participate in, on this Site and other sites on the Internet, from our other marketing activities and programs, and from third parties with whom we work. This data may be collected on an individual basis, such as through information you have provided to us on this Site or through a Program, or based on the use of cookies, pixels, web beacons and other technology, as described below.

The law requires that we and our suppliers may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or other like orders and in other ways necessary to comply with applicable law.
