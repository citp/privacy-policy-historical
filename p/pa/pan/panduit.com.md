**1) What we track**  
Our site's registration forms require you to give us contact information (like your first name, last name, and email address), demographic information (like your zip code), and your professional interest information (like industry and profession). Panduit retains this information for our internal use only. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your visits to www.panduit.com. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests each time you visit our site. While these activities depend on the use of a cookie, visitors to the Panduit web site always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. 

Panduit also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information on users to the site. 

**2) What we do with the information we gather**  
We are continually striving to make the Panduit web site a better information site for you. In order to do that, we continually monitor and analyze the aggregate information we collect on our users. We analyze traffic patterns throughout the Panduit site to highlight popular areas, and improve the sections which are not meeting the needs of our users. 

We may occasionally use customer contact information and professional interest information from the registration form to send email announcements about our company and products, and to contact you if there are any changes to the site that will affect your user experience.

A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your user name, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, destroy files, send you viruses, etc. Cookies also allow sites to track aggregate -- not individual -- page views, which helps us develop new features and services that our viewers are interested in. 

The cookie is a text file containing information that allows sites to save your personal settings. Be assured cookies do not breach your privacy. Moreover, they save you time by remembering your personalized settings. 

**So What's In It For You?**
