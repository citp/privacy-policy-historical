### Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors / users only)

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

As a general rule, we will only collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (for instance, your subscription to one of our products), or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (for instance, where we process personal data regarding the usage of our products and services, as described above). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

#### Learn More Below

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to provide our products and services and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our products and services, advising you of product features or new releases, informing you of product maintenance, or undertaking marketing activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate it will be clear to you at the relevant time regarding what those legitimate interests are.

Where we send you communications regarding our products or services from our different divisions and affiliates that may be of interest to you, we do so based on your consent, if and when required by applicable law.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.

### Cookies and similar tracking technology

We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and use personal information about you, including to serve interest-based advertising. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://web.archive.org/info/cookie_notice).

### How does S&P Global keep my personal information secure?

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.

### International data transfers

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

#### Learn More Below

Specifically, our servers are located in various countries which may be located outside of the jurisdiction where we collected the data, such as US, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands and Singapore. This means that when we collect your personal information we may transfer it to or process it in any of the countries in which we do business.

Our group companies, third party service providers, product content providers and partners, with whom we may share personal information as described above, are located in and transfer personal information to various jurisdictions around the world.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Customer Privacy Policy. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. 

You may request our Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting [privacy@panjiva.com](mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79@%70%61%6e%6a%69%76%61.%63%6f%6d). We have implemented appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

### Data retention

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a product or service you have requested, as set forth in our information governance procedures, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we follow our information governance procedures and either delete or anonymize your personal information, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**If you wish to receive further information about the period of time for which we will process your personal information, please contact[privacy@panjiva.com](mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79@%70%61%6e%6a%69%76%61.%63%6f%6d).**
