# Pantagraph.com - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

This policy describes how Pantagraph.com collects and utilizes users' personal information.

The Web site and its operators will not disclose a user's personal identifiable information to a third party without the user's express permission.

**Information we do not gather**

Users can access our Web site and use many of our services without providing any personal identifiable information. We do not follow a user's browsing path outside our Web site.

**Information we gather**

We do develop summary reports of usage for our advertisers. This includes the number of times pages or advertisements are viewed. This information is used to determine the effectiveness of advertising strategies. We do not tell our advertisers the identities of individual users who saw or clicked on their advertisements.

Certain services -- contests, for example -- require registration. The registration generally includes only name, street address, phone number and e-mail address and is necessary for the administration of the service. We do not share this information with third parties without disclosing that intention.

**E-mail and feedback**

We encourage our users to offer feedback or ask questions about our online and offline services, either by sending us e-mail or by filling out forms on our Web site. Users can include their name and other personal information if they wish, or they may send us feedback anonymously. In either case, we do not share this information with third parties without the user's express permission.

E-mails or other electronic submissions that indicate they are intended as letters to the editor may be published in The Pantagraph's opinion section. Inclusion of personal identifiable information is required to be considered for publication. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

**Opinion polls**

Pantagraph.com opinion polls allow users to submit their opinions on various topics. No submitted opinion is linked with a user's personal identifiable information; poll submissions are completely anonymous.

**"E-mail this page"**

Users can forward a story or page to someone else by clicking the "E-mail this page" link at the bottom of most pages. The user must provide his/her email address to tell the recipient who sent the story. Users can also choose to include a message. None of this information is used or tracked for any other purpose.

**Contests**

Pantagraph.com occasionally administers contests in which participants must register. Required information always includes at least name and basic contact information. Sometimes more information is required. The rules and terms of each contest can vary. Contests may be run in cooperation with advertisers or businesses. In cases where registration information may be shared with those parties, notices will appear on the contest entry form.

**Browser cookies**

Cookies are tiny information files sent by some Web pages and stored by your browser. A browser stores a cookie so that it remembers whether or not to take an action the next time you visit a page. For example, a cookie might tell a pop-up window not to appear the next time you visit. Pantagraph.com uses browser cookies only to enhance functionality for visitors. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we do not use cookies to collect a user's personal identifiable information. From our [cookie management page](https://web.archive.org/web/20051212132032id_/http%3A//www.pantagraph.com/info/cookiemanage.html) you can manage certain cookies to prevent certain pop-up windows from appearing.

**Subscribing to the paper or placing a classified ad**

Personal information is required to complete such transactions. The information is maintained in offline systems by the individual departments at The Pantagraph. The information is processed according to the procedures appropriate for the transaction.

**Links to external sites**

An external site is a Web site The Pantagraph does not control. Pantagraph.com contains links that, when clicked, may take users to external sites. Any link to a URL that does not contain the host name "pantagraph.com" might lead to an external site. The Pantagraph.com privacy policy does **not** apply to external sites. The Pantagraph is not responsible for the conduct of individuals or companies that maintain these external sites, nor is The Pantagraph responsible for the methods by which they collect or use information. Many external sites have their own privacy policies. Users are encouraged to read those policies or contact those sites' administrators to address any concerns they have about privacy at those sites.
