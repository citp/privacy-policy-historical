##  PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY 

**WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY  
(Revised January 2005)**

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&E,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is concerned about preventing unauthorized disclosure of customer information. We understand the importance you place on the privacy and security of information that personally identifies you or your Company account information. We refer to this information as “Personal Information.” We want you to know what Personal Information PG&E collects at pge.com (the “Web site”) and how we use it. PG&E has adopted the following Privacy Policy to explain our commitment to your privacy. By using the Web site, you agree to be bound by the PG&E Privacy Policy. Please review the contents of the PG&E Privacy Policy frequently, as we may amend it from time to time to reflect changes in our services and our policies relating to customer Personal Information. Amendments will become effective when posted on the Web site. PG&E will not provide you with a notice of any change in this Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to monitor and review any updates to the Privacy Policy. 

**1\. Information You Submit**

If you register to access various services related to your residential account or other applications involving your business account on the Web site, you may be asked to submit Personal Information such as your PG&E account number, name, address, partial Social Security Number (last four digits), phone number and e-mail address. You may also be asked to submit additional Personal Information or financial information in order to use certain specific services offered in these customer account transaction areas. We will protect all information you provide us on the Web site, as set forth below and in accordance with these [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/disclosure/). 

**2\. How We Use Your Information**

a. The Personal Information you provide us not only enables you to access various customer services offered on the Web site, but also enables us to provide you with better service generally. We may use this information to contact you to respond to an inquiry that you send to the Company or to keep you informed about the Company and its services. If you choose to communicate with the Company by e-mail, then e-mail from the Company to you will be considered to be sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has access to your e-mail.

b. In order to provide you with services offered on the Web site, or to complete transactions or requests initiated by you on the Web site, we may transfer you to outside services provided by third-party operators. In certain instances, the third-party content may be “framed” in such a way it appears you are still on PG&E’s Web site. In such cases, we will have agreements with those third parties whose web sites you may be transferred to, under which the third parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and to use it only to help us serve you. 

c. Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your written consent (which consent may be obtained electronically, such as by e-mail), unless we reasonably believe the disclosure is essential to the conduct of the Company’s business or to provide services to you, including but not limited to where such disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with the law, legal process or our regulators, (ii) collect unpaid bills, (iii) enable the Company’s employees or consultants to provide service to you and to otherwise perform their duties, (iv) comply with interchange functions, (v) obtain and provide credit reporting information, or (vi) resolve customer disputes or inquiries. We do not provide your Personal Information to third parties for telemarketing, e-mail or direct mail solicitation.

d. We request you protect the confidentiality of your user name and password. You are responsible for all activity on the Web site accessed by your user name and password. Access by the Company’s employees or consultants to any Personal Information you provide is limited to only information necessary to provide the business service offered and to allow employees or consultants to perform their duties.

**3\. Surveys, Contests and Promotions**

 **

We may on our own or in conjunction with other companies offer surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions (“Events”). You may be asked to supply certain Personal Information to participate in these Events, and this information may, under the rules governing such events, be used by the sponsoring parties for marketing purposes. Even if you previously elected not to receive information or mailings from third parties or us you may still receive information through your participation in these Events. If you are under the age of 18, you may be subject to special rules regarding your participation in certain Events. The rules governing each Event will be clearly posted, as will notification about how the information gathered may be used.

**4\. Children’s Privacy Online**

We also provide free classroom materials for teachers on energy awareness and safety. We do not monitor the age of users of the Web site.
