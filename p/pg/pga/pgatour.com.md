Thank you for visiting PGATOUR.com, a general audience site. This privacy policy is applicable to the Website(s) located at the domains "PGATOUR.COM", "GolfWeb.com", and other sites within the PGA TOUR network which may link to this privacy policy (collectively, the "Site") and which are operated by Turner Sports Interactive, Inc. ("TSI") pursuant to a strategic relationship with PGA TOUR LICENSED PROPERIES, INC. ("PGA TOUR") (TSI and PGA TOUR collectively referred to herein as "we", "our", or "us").

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at PGATOUR.com. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered through and in connection with this web site and do not necessarily reflect our practices for other sites operated by TSI or the practices of third parties other than TSI who operate sites which may be linked to from this web site such as [www.shop.pgatour.com](http://www.shop.pgatour.com/)

### THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

At our site, you may now or in the future be able to order products, enter contests, contribute to charity, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be asked to be submitted include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, date of birth, gender, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

You may also be able to submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

Certain features of our site may only be available to persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information such as persons ordering products, programs, and services or otherwise participating in the site's activities and offerings. We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

Finally, we may receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit the Site. For example, we may collect Automatic Information and your IP address. As used herein, "Automatic Information" is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages or ads from the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet.

### HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:

### Cookies

As with many Websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your user ID, preferences and other convenient Site usage information. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Additionally, accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you as well as limit how often you see certain ads that may detract from your user experience on our Site. If you do not want to allow information to be collected through the use of cookies, you can generally opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser. However, some areas of the Site may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.

### IP Addresses and Automatic Information

We may collect IP addresses and/or Automatic Information for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address. Automatic Information we collect may include, without limitation, such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such information. When analyzed, this data helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors (in the aggregate) are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may also use Automatic Information to provide you with a more personalized user experience.

### Web Beacons

Consistent with standard practice within the web publishing industry, web pages throughout the Site may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow us to access certain cookies that were set in a domain different from that which is displayed in the current web page's address bar. Our use of web beacons, includes, without limitation, the following:

  * We may use web beacons within the Site in order to count unique users (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views. Unique browser recognition is possible through the use of web beacons and associated cookies that may be managed by a third party site analytics partner.
  * We may use web beacons to monitor Site traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages. This allows us to determine the most appropriate methods to serve our transaction-oriented customers.
  * We may use web beacons to provide our web-serving applications with access to our cookies. This allows us to personalize your experience when you visit the Site.
  * We include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages in which we are able to include graphics). These beacons allow us to determine whether or not email messages were opened, links were clicked and notifications/offers were acted upon.



### Registration

In order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer (including, but not limited to, Site Customization, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, Fantasy Games or other subscription-based services), you may be asked to complete a registration form which will provide us with personally identifiable information.

### Contests or Sweepstakes

We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site which may require registration. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes. In the event you win a contest or sweepstakes, we may ask your permission to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winners page. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes that is promoted on the Site and, as part of the contest or sweepstakes, may collect your information. In those cases (where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes), we have no control over the information collected.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non- profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If our site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. You can opt out from such disclosures, either at the point of submission of your personally identifiable information or prior to any such disclosure.

At times, we may share your personally identifiable information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others:

### Agents

We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Site analysis, data analysis, marketing assistance, credit card payment processing, and customer service. These agents may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

### Co-Registration Programs

Throughout the Site you may be presented with an opportunity to receive special offers from third parties. Opt-in or opt-out messages will ask you if you would like your information to be shared. If you do choose to have your information shared, your information will be subject to the privacy policy of such third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other companies and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices of such companies prior to providing your personally identifiable information.

### Third-Party Ad Serving & Audience and Traffic Measurement Services

The Site may use third party network advertisers to serve the advertisements on the Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other Web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to your cookies as provided by the Site, the Site's third party network advertisers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser. These third party cookies are set for purposes including but not limited to targeting advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding how useful certain advertisements are to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one.
