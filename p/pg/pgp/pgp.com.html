      <p class="header">PGP Corporation (the Company) respects your
        privacy and is committed to protecting all personal information that
        you provide. This Privacy Statement is created to inform you of the Company's
        privacy policies and practices and to explain how your information is
        collected and used.</p>
      <p> <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
        <br> 
        This Privacy Statement covers collection of personal
        information and non-personal information. Personal information is any
        information associated with your name or personal identity. Non-personal
        information is data about usage patterns, reported in aggregate, which
        is not associated with a specific personal identity. </p>
          <p>
  PGP Corporation uses personal information to better understand customer needs
  and interests and to provide better service. Personal information will only
  be used to support customer relationships with the company. </p>
  <p>
  In general, you can visit the PGP® website without providing any personal
  information. If you order products or services or request information on the
  site, however, you will be asked to provide personal information, including
  name, address, phone, email address, and credit card information. Credit card
  information is used only for payment and order processing and fraud prevention,
  and is not used for any other purpose. </p>
  <p>
  Non-personal information collected may include the pages visited on <a href="http://www.pgp.com/">http://www.pgp.com/</a>,
  browser type, browser language, operating system, and IP address. Non-personal
  data is aggregated to understand PGP website usability and performance. </p>
  <p>
  <b>Cookies</b><br>
  Most non-personal information is collected via cookies. PGP Corporation may
  use cookies to enhance the user experience and personalize content. A cookie
  is a small data file that is transferred to your hard drive and identifies
  you as a unique user. Cookies help the Company understand which areas of the
  website are most popular to help improve the user experience on future visits. </p>
  <p>
  <b>IP Addresses</b><br>
  PGP Corporation may use your IP address to help diagnose problems or to gather
  demographic information, such as country of origin. </p>
  <p>
  <b>JavaScript</b><br>
  PGP Corporation uses JavaScript code to gather information about a user's browser.
  This non-personal information includes window and screen size, browser language,
  color depth, and plug-ins installed. </p>
  <p>
  <b>Financial Information</b><br>
  The PGP website includes forms that you complete to request information, products,
  and services. These forms may collect your financial information, such as your
  credit card details. Any financial information you submit will only be used
  for billing, payment, and order processing purposes. </p>
  <p>
  PGP Corporation employs secure server technology for online purchasing. The
  secure server technology used encrypts your personal financial information
  before it is transmitted over the Internet, making it secure. You can only
  purchase products on the PGP website using a browser that supports secure server
  technology. </p>
  <p>
  <b>Disclosure of User Information</b><br>
  PGP Corporation will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to
  third parties. The Company will not share your personal information with business
  partners or any other third-party company, except as described below:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>Agents:</b> PGP Corporation employs other companies and people
    to perform tasks on its behalf and may need to share your information with
    them to provide products or services to you. Examples include providing customer
    service, processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, and providing
    marketing assistance. Unless advised otherwise, these agents do not have
    any right to use your information PGP Corporation shares with them beyond
    what is necessary to assist the Company. You hereby consent to our sharing
    of your information for the above purposes. </li>
  <li><b>Business Transfers:</b> In some cases, PGP Corporation may choose
    to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information
    is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if
    PGP Corporation or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the
    unlikely event that the Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
    customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
    by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
    any acquirer of PGP Corporation may continue to use your information as set
    forth in this policy.</li>
  <li><b>Promotional Offers:</b> PGP Corporation may send promotional
    offers to you. However, you will be provided the opportunity to opt not to
    receive such promotional offers.</li>
  <li><b>Protection of PGP Corporation and others:</b> The Company may
    release your information when it believes in good faith that release is necessary
    to comply with law; enforce or apply its conditions of use and other agreements;
    or protect the rights, property, or safety of PGP Corporation, its employees,
    its users, or others. This release includes exchanging information with other
    companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction
    (as described above) and to comply with export laws.</li>
  <li><b>With your Consent:</b> Except as set forth above, you will be
    notified when your information may be shared with third parties, and will
    be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</li>
	</ul>
	
  <p><b>Data Integrity and Security</b><br>
  PGP Corporation strives to maintain the reliability, accuracy, and completeness
  of personal information in its databases and to protect the privacy and security
  of its databases. PGP servers and databases are protected by reliable security
  technology.</p>
  <p> <b>Your Choices Relating to Your Personal
        Information</b><br>
    As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose personal information
    to PGP Corporation, even though it may be needed to make a purchase or take
    advantage of certain PGP features. You may request an update or deletion
    of your PGP account by sending an email to <a href="mailto:customersupport@pgp.com">customersupport@pgp.com</a>.</p>
        <p> Please note that some information may remain in backups of
                  the Company's records after deletion of your account, although
                  diligent efforts will be employed to remove your information.
                  However, the Company may retain certain of your information
                  if it believes in good faith that retaining such information
                  is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply its conditions
                  of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,
                  or safety of PGP Corporation, its employees, its users, or
                  others.</p>
        <p> <b>Your Consent and Our Revisions
                      to the Privacy Statement</b><br>
