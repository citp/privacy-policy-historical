# Privacy Policy | PGi.com

Premiere Global Services, Inc. and our subsidiaries (collectively, "PGi") recognize and respect the importance of protecting your privacy. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in this privacy policy (this "Policy") to govern our use and disclosure of your personal information. While it is impossible to guarantee that such information is or will be completely safe from unauthorized access or use, the following Policy is intended to inform you of the steps we take to protect the information you choose to provide to us. We recommend that you carefully review this Policy before providing us with your personal information.

**Scope**

This Policy applies to all of the services offered by PGi (“PGi Services”) and all of PGi’s websites, including all PGi websites that link to this Policy (but not to those PGi websites that have their own privacy statement) (collectively, the “Websites”) and to all personal information that we directly collect or receive from you, whether manually or digitally processed. It does not apply to information our customers collect or receive from you.  While we take commercially reasonable measures to protect all personal information in our control or possession, we cannot guarantee or enforce the privacy policies of our customers. For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of our individual customers' websites before disclosing any personal information to or through them.

**Use of Cookies and other Web Technologies**

When you browse our Websites, you may do so anonymously as personal information is not collected during browsing. There is a technology called "cookies," which can be used to provide you with tailored information. Like many websites, we may use cookies to provide you with better service.  Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make a website more useful by storing information about your preferences for a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major websites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies on our Websites. We treat any personal information that may be contained in cookies with the same level of protection as other personal information you provide to us.

To the extent our Website may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc), personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the widget.  Information collected by this widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it. 

_Third Party Cookies_

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by this Policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

_Other Third Party Tracking_

**Security**

We are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us and utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.   No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If we obtain knowledge that it has personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will delete that information from our existing files. In addition, anyone under 18 years old should seek their parent’s or guardian’s permission prior to using or disclosing any personal information on our Websites.
