|  Information Sharing

The success of our business depends on your trust, and we do not sell your personal information to marketers outside of P&G. We share your personal information only as described below and within P&G.

In general, we do not share personal information with marketers outside of P&G unless we have clearly asked for and obtained your explicit consent.

Third-party service providers. We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. In so doing, we may need to share your personal information with them. Please note that we provide our service providers with only the personal information they need to perform their services and we require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose.

For example, we may rely on a service provider to: 

  * Fulfill your product and service requests and answer your questions.
  * Host our sites and deliver our email and mobile messages.
  * Mail product samples, contact contest winners, manage payments or take other actions on our behalf.
  * Analyze data, sometimes combined with other sources, to send more targeted communications to you.
  * Conduct research and analyze data to improve our products, services and sites.

 _In addition, where permitted by law, we may also rely on a service provider to:_  


  * Combine personal information about you that P&G has collected with personal information about you that our business partner has collected so we can jointly send tailored promotional communications to you. In such instances, our business partner will not have direct access to any information we share about you with the service provider, and only the service provider will be allowed to use the combined set of information to send you joint communications that we hope will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these joint communications, you can always opt out by following the instructions provided in any such communication or through this Privacy Statement as indicated above
  * Perform other services that we request.



We provide these companies with the personal information they need to provide these services on our behalf. We require these companies to protect this personal information and to not use the information for any other purpose.

Other situations. We may disclose your personal information: 

  * If a P&G brand is sold to another company.
  * Where permitted by law, to protect and defend the rights and property of P&G (including enforcing our Terms and Conditions).
  * And when required by law, and/or public authorities.



Aggregated and non-personal information. We may share aggregated information that cannot identify you for general business analysis. For example, we may disclose the number of visitors to P&G sites or services.

|  User Generated Content

Some P&G sites enable users to submit their own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions. Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal, financial or other information in a submission. P&G cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Statement, the law, or your personal privacy and safety and is not responsible for the results of such postings.

We are committed to keeping personal information secure. We have appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures in place to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration.

When we do collect personal information from children, we do so in compliance with applicable country children’s data protection laws.
