# Privacy Policy | pbreview.com

pbReview.com respects users' privacy rights and believes that privacy protections are fundamental to a viable and safe Internet Community. Our goal is to provide Internet services, including an Internet "public square" where people can discuss issues related to the quality of paintball fields, paintball products and other similar issues related to the sport and culture of paintball.

Other than providing a forum for the exchange of views and opinions related to paintball, pbReview.com does not maintain a relationship with its individual users. Accordingly, pbReview.com does not endorse the views expressed by its registered users and does not warranty the accuracy or quality of its user postings.

In order to provide a vibrant forum for the collection of information, we need to collect certain user information. The pbReview.com Web site collects information on users in several ways.

**REGISTRATION**

First, users provide us with certain information such as your name, e-mail address and postal addresses when registering for a user name. Once a user registers for a new user account that user is no longer anonymous to pbReview.com, and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in pbReview.com's both herein, in the [Terms of Use](http://www.pbreview.com/terms/), and on the Registration Page (collectively, "Governing Documents").

**COOKIES**

Second, we may track your visit to our Web site by giving you a "cookie" when you enter. pbReview.com may use cookies for record keeping purposes and may store and track information about users for internal use. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to a Web browser and stored on your computer's hard drive so it can later be read back from that browser.

At the time of such offer, you may opt out of receiving such notices. We may use anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers deliver better targeted advertisements.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION**

pbReview.com will not disclose to any non-affiliated third party, any identifying information about any individual user, except (i) with such users permission; (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it to protect pbReview.com' property or rights or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public; (iii) for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, or improve products and services; (iv) in the event of a joint venture, merger, acquisition or change of control, to the successor entity or to its officers, directors, employees or affiliates.

**GOVERNMENTAL DISCLOSURE**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pbReview.com reserves the right, if requested by federal, state or local ruling, law or court order, to disclose any personal information provided herein to the requesting agency or to the other applicable government entity.
