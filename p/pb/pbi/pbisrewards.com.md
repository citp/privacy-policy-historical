# Privacy Policy | PBIS Rewards

_Effective July 1, 2016_

## Purpose

This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we collect when you use the PBIS Rewards service and how we use and disclose that information. This policy applies to the client of record of the PBIS Rewards service and end users of the PBIS Rewards service. If you are an end user of the service, you should also consult with the school or organization who has subscribed to this service as their Privacy Policy may be different than this Privacy Policy.

By subscribing to the PBIS Rewards system provided by [Motivating Systems](https://motivatingsystems.com/) and/or by using the service, you expressly consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

_We collect and store information so that we may provide services to you. We do not sell or provide  any information to outside parties without first obtaining your explicit consent except as outlined below under the heading Law Enforcement Agencies. _

There are three types of users of the PBIS Rewards System and our Privacy Policy applies in distinct ways to each of these types of users.

  * **Organizational Users** – Organizational users includes the School’s or Organization’s staff and/or teachers who use the system;
  * **Student Users** – Students at the School or Organization;
  * **Parent Users** – Parents or Guardians of students at the School or Organization.



## What We Collect

The information we collect is based on the type of user. All information collected is explicitly given to us by the School or Organization. Some of the information is required and some of the information is optional. The full list is as follows:

  * **Organizational Users**
    * Required Information includes Personal Name, Email Address, and Staff Code. The staff code does not need to match an employee ID number used within other systems at the organization but must be unique for each Organizational User.
    * Not Required Information includes Phone Number and Photo.
  * **Student Users**
    * Required Information includes Personal Name (although a letter abbreviation can be used for the first name), Student ID Number (although it is not required to match the Student ID Number used in other systems within your organization).
    * Not Required information includes Gender, Grade, Ethnicity, Photo. Although these items are not required, they are strongly recommended in order to simplify use of the system and to improve reporting on the performance of your PBIS program.
    * If you use the PBIS Rewards system to track Office Disciple Referrals, then we also collect information about the Office Disciple Referrals so that we can provide you with reports on Office Disciple Referrals.
  * **Parent Users** – We do not collect any personal information on Parents. We do identify the device type and other characteristics of the device that is running the PBIS Rewards Parent App.



## How We Use the Information We Collect

  * **Organizational Users** – 1) To verify your identity when you use the PBIS Rewards service or when you communicate to us; 2) To communicate administrative announcements to you about the status of the services we offer and provide to you; 3) to communicate useful tips and suggestions to you to help you get the most out of the PBIS Rewards service.
  * **Student Users** – To verify your identity when you use the PBIS Rewards service.
  * **Parent Users** – To verify that the owner of the smart device has been granted permission to view information about a student.



## Protection

To prevent unauthorized access, promote data security, and encourage appropriate use of information, we have strict internal policies and use a variety of security tools to assist in the protection of your personal information. You will find more information in our [Security Statement](https://www.pbisrewards.com/security-overview/).

We may provide links to websites operated by companies that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose your personal information to the operators of such third-party websites without obtaining your consent. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third-party sites. If you choose to visit one of these third-party sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on such third-party site to understand how that party collects, uses and discloses your personal information.

## Law Enforcement Agencies

If requested by a generally recognized Law Enforcement Agency or government official, we may provide information without your consent if it is in connection with the investigation of illegal activities. We retain the right to determine if we will require legal documentation before providing this information. We may or may not inform you that we have shared your information with a Law Enforcement Agency or government official.
