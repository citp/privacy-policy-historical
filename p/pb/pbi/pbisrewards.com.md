### Form Data

Some of the forms are request forms that you fill out requesting that we send you more information about our service or a specific resource. Some of the forms are requests for support. These forms will ask you for your name, email address, and telephone number in addition to other information required to fulfill your request.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. It may contain certain data, including, but not limited to: the name of the server that has placed it there, an identifier in the form of a unique number, and an expiration date (if applicable to the cookie). Cookies are managed by the web browser on your computer (i.e. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari). Our Website uses these cookies to collect information and to improve our Website. You can block cookies from our Website, but it may make some features of the Website unusable.

Some of the cookies are put in place so that we can market our services to you using third-party advertising services and some of the cookies are put in place so that we can collect anonymous demographic data about visitors to our Website so that we can better tailor content to our audience.

### Pixel Tracking

In addition to using Cookies, our Website may employ “pixel tracking”, a common process which may be used in connection with our advertisements on other sites. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A “pixel tag” is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user’s activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our services and other offers with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement we placed on another website, the pixel tag will let us know which website and advertisement led you to visit our Website. If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.
