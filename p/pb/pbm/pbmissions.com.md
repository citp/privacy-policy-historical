# Privacy Policy

Thank you for shopping with us. We are fully committed to protecting your privacy. To enhance your shopping experience, we collect statistical information on the products and pages you view, and then we analyze that information in the aggregate. When you place an order, we necessarily collect basic information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information. We use this information to confirm and ship your order, and to communicate with you concerning the status of your order and to answer any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (such as product manufacturers and suppliers, freight carriers, and/or shipping companies) for the sole purpose of processing and shipping your order.

After you place an order or register for our newsletter, we may contact you at a future date to keep you informed of sales, promotions, new product releases, etc. Any additional information you provide us will enable us to customize your experience at our site, showing you products and specials that may interest you.

We have put security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, and alteration of the information we collect. We utilize a firewall and use SSL encryption (secure certificate) to keep your information secure. We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify you and possibly to gather general demographic information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of the products in your shopping cart so you don't have to re-add them each time you visit. You do NOT have to accept cookies to browse our site. However, our shopping cart does require the acceptance of cookies in order to work properly. We never use cookies to store sensitive customer information such as names, addresses, passwords, or credit card information. If you would like to place an order on our site but object to or are unable to use cookies, please place your order via our toll-free number, 1-866-906-8673.

There are several "Tell a Friend" features on our site that allow you to easily share product or other valuable information with your friends. Any e-mail addresses provided to us in the use of these features are used solely to deliver that particular e-mail. They are NOT retained in our database.

If we change this Privacy Policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on this site. Any changes will go into effect on the date they are posted and will apply to all users.
