<b>For Families Visiting PBS Kids:</b>



<p>You have trusted us for many years to make safe and quality content that family members of all ages can enjoy. In the cyberspace world, this trust is even more important to your family, and to PBS Kids. To make sure that this site stays safe and fun, we make the following promises: 



</p><p></p><ul>


<li>In almost all activities, the information we collect is non-personal (such as first name, age, city and state).  If you enter a contest, send us a question or send an electronic postcard, we will also ask for an e-mail address. We only collect enough information from our visitors to make activities on PBS Kids fun and interesting. <p>

</p></li><li>If you submit stories, artwork, comments or anything else to us which is posted on our site, you will be identified on our site only by first name, age, city and state.<p>

</p></li><li>If you send us an e-mail with a question or comment, or enter one of our contests, we will write back using your e-mail address, but we will not keep the address or use it again.<p>

</p></li><li>If you ask PBS Kids to send an electronic postcard or e-mail message, we will ask for your first name and e-mail address as well as the e-mail address of the person who will receive the postcard.  We will only use this information to send the postcard or message and we will delete the information when the postcard or message is sent.<p>   

</p></li><li>No one will be excluded from our site for not giving us personal information.  When we do ask for personal information (like an e-mail address), we will only keep it until that particular activity is complete.  We will not share this information with a third party.<p>


</p></li><li>If we know a visitor is under the age of thirteen, we will collect a parent's permission offline (by postal mail, fax or phone) before we mail any prizes, or collect or share personal information with anyone else.<p>


</p></li><li>If you <a href="/in_your_town/">localize</a> pbskids.org to the PBS station nearest you, a <a href="/in_your_town/cookieinfo.html">cookie</a> will tell us your station's call letters. PBS Kids only keeps track of how many computers choose each station.  No personal information is stored in the cookie, even if you have entered your name or e-mail address on other parts of PBS Online.  You can choose to have your computer <a href="/in_your_town/">remember</a> a different station, or no station at all, at any time.  Please note that if you come to pbskids.org from a local station site, you will be automatically localized to that station. 

</li></ul>



<p>We also promise to help families and communities find the information they need to use the Internet safely and responsibly. 



</p><p></p><ul>



<li>When a PBS Kids site is partially funded by outside sponsors, we will mark any underwriter logos with a "sponsored by" tag. We choose our underwriters carefully, to make sure that the company's products and services fit PBS standards. PBS Kids sites will not contain advertisements promoting e-commerce or direct links to e-commerce.<p>



</p></li><li>All links to third party sites are insulated with a PBS Kids bridge page.  These pages clearly notify the visitor that he or she is leaving PBS Kids, and offers an opportunity to return to PBS Kids. Each bridge page displays a Web literacy tip, educating visitors how to be safe on the Internet.  In the case of a sponsor's link, the bridge page will provide more information about the sponsor's relationship to PBS.  Since we cannot be assured that links to outside sites follow our safety or privacy guidelines, we encourage families to discuss these choices together.  We are not responsible for the content or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.<p>



</p></li><li>With areas of our site like "<a href="/bts/license/">Get Your Web License</a>," and our "<a href="literacytips.html">Know Before You Go</a>" Web literacy tips, we will continue to empower our visitors by helping them to make informed choices.



</li></ul>



<p>Your family's use of this site is conditioned on your having accepted these terms. You should check back to this policy frequently, since it is subject to change from time to time, and your continued use of the site is conditioned upon your acceptance of any modifications hereto.



</p><p>We want to make this site a place where families can surf together, and where parents and caregivers are happy to have their children interact, learn and play. If you have any comments or questions, we're happy to hear them. This is, after all, <b>your</b> site.



</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, send us an e-mail at 

<a href="/write/write.html">kids@pbs.org</a>. 

You may also contact us at 1320 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314 (703 739-5127).  

Please read the <a href="rulesoftheroad.html">Rules of the Road</a> for  Terms and Conditions for using this site.  Read the <a href="/cgi-registry/kidsbridge.cgi?context=pbskids_pbsonline_privacy">PBS
