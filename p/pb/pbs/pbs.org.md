pbs.org Privacy Policy

Nothing is more important to us than protecting the private information of our visitors. From the pbs.org homepage to more than 150,000 pages of content produced by our affiliates, the "pbs.org" domain remains a safe haven. All PBS-affiliated web sites adhere to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your — and your children's — personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information) and preserving the integrity of this online medium. 

**Gathering and Use of Information**

  1. We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis. 
  2. In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information. This could be in connection with the following:
    * contest or sweepstakes registration 
    * subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters) 
    * requests for membership information to local television stations 
    * transactions in shopPBS 
    * content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting
  3. pbs.org will not willfully disclose your personal information to any third party without first receiving your permission. 
  4. pbs.org may use your personally identifiable information for activities explained above, for internal and marketing promotional purposes, or when shopPBS customer mailing lists are made available to carefully screened companies whose products or services might interest individuals who have shopped on the PBS web site (this is the only case where such information is provided to third parties, at your approval). 
  5. We will always explain the extent of its use at the time you are asked to provide personal information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt out." Under certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal information is needed, as in contests.

**Tracking and Use of Cookies**

As you explore pbs.org, it is possible that several cookies* will be set on your computer. PBS uses the information from cookies to deliver relevant local resources, remember browser preferences, and improve our visitors' experiences on the site.

No personal information is ever stored in a PBS cookie, even if you have entered your name or e-mail address on other parts of pbs.org. PBS does not sell information collected by cookies nor use the information for commerce-related purposes. In addition, PBS will not filter content based on your preferences without permission.

PBS uses cookies at the following times:

  * **If you[localize](http://www.pbs.org/stationfinder/index.html) pbs.org to the PBS station nearest you, a cookie will tell us your station's call letters**. PBS only keeps track of how many computers choose each station. You can choose to have your computer [remember a different station](http://www.pbs.org/stationfinder/index.html), or [no station](http://www.pbs.org/stationfinder/index.html) at all, at any time. Please note that if you come to pbs.org from a local station site, and you were not previously localized to a station, you may be automatically localized to that station.
  *  **If you watch a video clip or listen to an audio clip on pbs.org, a cookie may remember which media player (such as Real Player or Windows Media Player) and which type of clip (high or low bandwidth) you prefer to use on your computer.** You can change your video and audio preferences at any time, or choose a player each time you view or listen to a clip.
  *  **A cookie will tell us which pages you visit and the amount of time between each page visit.** This cookie does not remember any information about you or your computer; it just helps us at PBS monitor site usage and traffic; for example, it allows us to measure the number of repeat visitors to pbs.org in a given month.



***What's a cookie?** A cookie is information a Web site puts on your computer's hard drive so that the site can remember your preferences or which pages you visited on that site. 

**PBS Kids Privacy Policy**

Because PBS Kids speaks to a special audience, web sites that provide components for children must follow additional guidelines above and beyond the pbs.org policies. For complete guidelines on information collection and sponsorship, please visit the [PBS Kids Privacy Policy](http://pbskids.org/privacy).
