1\. Information that we collect about you**

**PBS &J designs web sites that may collect and maintain certain personal information about you when you send us email or complete any of our online forms such as Feedback or Contact Us. This personal information can identify you and your business individually, and may include items such as your name and email address, job title, company name and address, phone number, web site address and contact details of the Web Site Administrator.**

**PBS &J also collects, or logs, certain other information that cannot personally identify you when you visit our Web Site. This information includes your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and your domain name. Your IP address is the number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the ISP computer through which you access the Web and your domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which you access the Web.**

**PBS &J logs these IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, and various other site use statistics. This monitoring helps us to evaluate how our Web Site is used and to continuously improve the content we provide. While we may report aggregated IP address information to the Client who is paying for the Web Site hosting service, PBS&J does not link IP addresses or domain names with any personal information that can be used to identify the User. This means that a visitor's session will be logged on our servers, but the visitor will always remain anonymous.**
