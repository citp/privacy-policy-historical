We will send you strictly product/service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, to assist you with product usage or notification of product and service maintenance, we might send you an email.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [unsubscribe@gonitro.com](mailto:unsubscribe@gonitro.com).

## Sharing and disclosure

e will share or sell your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy (see the "Business Transitions" section below).

We may provide your Personal Information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may disclose Personal Information when the disclosure:

  * is required by law; or
  * is necessary to protect our interests or where we believe we have a duty to disclose that information; or
  * has been consented to by you.



## Business Transitions

In the event Nitro goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or prominent notice on our Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control that affects your Personal Information.

## Access

You may request that we provide you with access to the Personal Information we hold about you at any time. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days. If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire to use our Services, you may correct, update, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change in your account or by emailing us or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. Generally we will be able to provide you with such access. However, where:

  * the access impacts the privacy of others,
  * the request for access is frivolous or vexatious,
  * there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings,
  * such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency, or
  * where the information is evaluative or we have some other reasonable basis not to provide access



We may not be able to provide you with access to such information. If we deny your request for access, we will let you know why. We may also charge a fee to cover our reasonable costs associated with your request.

## Personal information security and data retention

We will take reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse or alteration. This includes both physical and technological security measures. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and you agree that you submit information to us at your own risk. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your Personal Information to provide you Services, please contact us. However, we will retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal or other obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our rights and agreements.
