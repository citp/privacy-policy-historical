        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div>
    <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Customers can access the PDFfiller service (the “<b>Service</b>”) through our website www.PDFfiller.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “<b>Device</b>” is any computer used to access the PDFfiller Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the PDFfiller Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<p>    •  What information we collect and why we collect it.</p>
<p>    •  How we use that information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is our policy to respect the privacy of our customers regarding any information that we may collect while operating our website and our mobile products.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>1. What Personal Information Does PDFfiller Collect and Store?</h2><p></p>
<p><strong><i>Personal Information You Provide to Us.</i></strong> The types of Personal Information collected may include customers’ username, email address, fax number, name of the file faxed/emailed/printed/stored, and browser/mobile device information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Payment details</u></i></b> Customers’ payments are processed directly through paypal or through a credit card processing company. We do not have access to and do not store our customers’ credit card or paypal payment information. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Files.</u></i></b> We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the PDFfiller’s Service (“<b>Files</b>”).</p>
<p>Files filled out by customers are stored on the server. However, these files and the customers information contained therein are accessible only to the customers of the account in which they are stored. The data contained in these files is encrypted and is unreadable and unusable for anyone else including PDFfiller. Customers have the option to remove a filled out form at any point, which removes all the information from our servers. Files contained in an account without a paid subscription will be automatically deleted in 30 days. </p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Log Data.</u></i></b> When you use the Service, we (ourselves or using third party services) automatically record some information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Cookies.</u></i></b> We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Geo-Location Information.</u></i></b> Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>2. How we use information we collect? </h2><p></p>
<p><b><i><u>Personal Information</u></i></b> is or may be used: (i) to set up an account and profile and to securely access their PDFfiller account, (ii) to administer your use of the Service and to provide and improve our Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or send us an email to <a href="mailto:support@pdffiller.com">support@pdffiller.com</a>.</p>
<p>PDFfiller discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PDFfiller 's behalf or to provide services available at PDFfiller 's website and mobile platforms, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of USA; by using PDFfiller 's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Log Data and Cookies</u></i></b> are or maybe used in aggregate form. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify customers have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><b><i><u>Records of Communication. </u></i></b>When you contact PDFfiller, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other customers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>PDFfiller Customer Emails.</u></i></b> PDFfiller may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with PDFfiller and our products.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Foreign Processing.</u></i></b> PDFfiller processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Retention of Records</u></i></b>. Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>3. Disclosure of Information </h2><p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>For legal reasons.</u></i></b> We may disclose to parties outside PDFfiller, files stored in your PDFfiller account and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of PDFfiller or its customers; or (d) to protect PDFfiller’s property rights. If we provide your PDFfiller files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove PDFfiller’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, PDFfiller will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on PDFfiller.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Business Transfers.</u></i></b> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i><u>Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</u></i></b> We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>4. Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2><p></p>
<p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing information in your “My Account” page. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your <a href="/en/account.htm">My Account</a> page. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact support@pdffiller.com. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p></p><h2>5. Data and File Retention</h2><p></p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Once your subscription expires, your files will be deleted automatically within 30 days. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by visiting <a href="/en/account.htm">My Account</a>. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other customers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>6. PDFfiller for Corporate Customers</h2><p></p>
<p>If you have a Corporate PDFfiller account, your Administrator may be able to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>access information in and about your PDFfiller for Business account;</li>
    <li>disclose, restrict, or access information that you have provided or that is made available to you when using your PDFfiller Corporate account; and</li>
    <li>control how your PDFfiller Corporate account may be accessed or deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to your organization's policies if you have questions about your Administrator's rights.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>7. Third Party Applications. </h2><p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by PDFfiller, Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or inpiduals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in our PDF Search Engine search results, sites that may include PDFfiller’s services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>8. Enforcement</h2><p></p>
<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our customers directly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>9. Privacy Policy Changes</h2><p></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>10.Security</h2><p></p>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at <a href="http://support@pdffiller.com">support@pdffiller.com</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p><h2>11. Our Policy Toward Children</h2><p></p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us to <a href="mailto:support@pdffiller.com">support@pdffiller.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Questions or Concerns?</p>
<p>If you would like to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy or PDFfiller's collection and use of your Personally Identifying Information please contact PDFfiller at support@ PDFfiller.com</p>
