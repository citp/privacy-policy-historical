To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of Investintech, Investintech's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
			<p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.</p>
			<p>If you have a question about this statement, you can send an email to the Investintech privacy officer who is also our President.
