# PDR.net | Privacy Policy

**Revised October 16, 2010**

This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you how PDR Network, LLC (“PDR Network”, “we” or “us”) secures and uses the personal information collected from individuals including healthcare professionals in connection with PDR Network’s products and services. In particular, the statement describes how PDR Network handles personal information collected via the www.pdr.net Web site, other Web sites that link to this privacy statement, online registration, and offline PDR surveys, etc. By using this site or any of the PDR Network services, you indicate your acceptance of PDR Network’s Privacy Policy. 

## Our Philosophy

Your trust is our greatest asset. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that information held by PDR Network-powered Web sites is confidential and secure. We disclose our information-security practices to you as clearly and fully as possible. These practices receive continuous oversight, and many of our business decisions, including Web design, technology selections, and third-party business relationships, begin and end with considerations for your privacy. 

## Changes to Policy

While our philosophy will not change, the details of the policy, including how we use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy statement may change over time. If we make a material change to our policy, we will post and highlight the policy changes, and we will also notify you via e-mail or take other reasonable steps to give you an opportunity to opt-out of the new data uses. Please refer back to this page regularly. The date the policy was last revised will always appear at the top of the policy pages. 

## Site Ownership, Scope, and Applicability of the Policy

This Policy applies only when you are within the PDR Network-branded environment and only to information that PDR Network collects. Please note that our Web sites may provide direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites. This privacy statement does not describe the practices of these parties. Before disclosing personal information to any third party, you should read the privacy notice associated with that site, as PDR Network has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.  
Note: Other PDR Network Web sites (including consumer-focused sites such as www.pdrhealth.com and www.pdrbookstore.com) and services (such as the bookstore) are controlled by their own privacy statements. These can be obtained by clicking on the Web site privacy policy link or contacting customer service at the number below. 

## Information that We Collect

In general, you may visit this Web site without providing any personal information. The information we collect from Web site visitors is collected on an aggregate basis, and is not used to identify you in any way. 

If you want to interact with PDR Network online and take advantage of the materials available on the PDR Network Web site for qualified professionals (such as the annual PDR® print book and FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts), you may register and join the PDR Network professional community. Registration is voluntary and free to qualified professionals. 

When you join the PDR Network professional community, we collect contact information (such as name, office address, office phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address), and other personal information (such as information about your professional background, licensure, practice, and areas of specialization as well as any other personal information that you choose to provide us). 

We will tailor the materials we provide you based on the information in your profile, such as your specialty. Please note that certain products (such as the PDR® Book, FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts, and sampling services) may only available to qualified, credentialed professionals, so you may not receive access to all of the services we offer if we cannot confirm your qualifications for them. 

If you are a registered user of PDR Network products and services, we will also collect and use activity statistics so we can understand the ways in which our sites and services are being utilized. For example, we will record information about the PDR activities in which you participate, newsletters you subscribe to, and Web sites, tools and other services that you use. Activity related data is stored anonymously and it is only used in the form of aggregated statistics. This aggregated, anonymous data may also be shared with business partners. Activity related data cannot be used to target you with solicitations of any kind. 

None of our sites or services are directed at children, and we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we do not accept personal information from persons under 13 years of age. 

## How We Use Your Information

In general, we use the information we collect in order to:

  * Respond to your requests for information
  * Provide you with products and services, including FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts
  * Determine if you are eligible for certain products or services
  * Provide customer service
  * Provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing and educational materials from us and our partners



If you purchase a product from us (such as a book or newsletter subscription), you may provide us with a credit card number. This credit card number may be stored but will only be used and disclosed as needed to process your purchase. We will not disclose credit card numbers to any third party for marketing purposes under any circumstances. 

## When We Share Your Information with Others

We work with business partners to provide the highest-quality services available. We may provide your information to third parties as needed to fulfill your requests for products and services or to facilitate the delivery of appropriate notices to you. For example, if you choose to participate in complimentary pharmaceutical product sampling programs, we will provide your information to the third party as required by the terms of the sampling program. 

We do not share or sell e-mail addresses or fax numbers for third party marketing purposes.  
Unless you tell us not to (i.e. ‘opt-out’), we may provide information about you or your practice to third parties. For example, we share our lists with selected business partners so that they may offer products or services of interest to you. We may also share your information with other third parties who perform services for us, but we, by contract in most cases, prohibit these companies from using your personal information for their own purposes. These companies may only use your information to perform the services on our behalf. 

## Your Choices

We use good faith efforts to respect your preferences about our use and disclosure of your information. We only want to send you information if you want to receive it.

You may change your communication preferences at any time by doing any of the following things: 

  * Updating your profile through the profile link on a PDR Network Web site homepage

## How We Secure Information Transmissions

We have implemented reasonable technical, physical, and administrative controls to help prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example, when we ask users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number), or any information during the registration or profile update process, the data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

## Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees

PDR Network may deploy mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving messages or data from/to your mobile device. 

## Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes

PDR Network may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in PDR Network’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information, but any such use remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice. 

You acknowledge that PDR Network is located in the U.S. and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement, or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.
