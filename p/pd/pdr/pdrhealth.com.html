                <p>
                    In general, we use all of the information we collect in order to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>respond to your requests for information</li>

                    <li>provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing
                        and educational materials from us and our partners</li>
                </ul>
               
                <p>We may also share your information with other third parties who perform services for us, but we forbid these companies from using your personal information for their own purposes.
                </p>
                <p>Please note that we may disclose any information as required by law or when needed to protect our legal rights. For example, we may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you in connection with the transfer of assets of our business. Additionally, as we continue to develop the PDRhealth web site, we might sell or buy business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Your Choices</h3>
                <p>We use good faith efforts to respect your preferences about our use of your information. We only want to send you information if you want to receive it. You may opt-out of emails by using the unsubscribe feature on the email communication.</p>
                <h3>
                    Accessing your Information</h3>
                <p>We strive to provide all our customers with reasonable opportunity to access and update their customer profile information. If you have sent us your email address, you may access and update this information by contacting our customer support department.</p>
                
                <h3>
                    Privacy Statement Parameters</h3>
                <p>
                    This privacy statement describes the policies governing the PDRhealth web site. It does not govern the practices at other PDR web sites (such as pdrbookstore.com and pdr.net).
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Cookies and Web Site Information
                </h3>
                <p>Like most other commercial web sites, we use standard "cookie" technology and web server logs to collect information about how our web site is used. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by your web browser on your hard drive. The cookies allow our web servers to recognize the computers used to access our web sites. Cookies allow you to move from page to page on the web site, by remembering the information about the entire session.</p>
                
                <p>Information gathered through cookies and by our web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our web site, and the web sites visited just before and just after our web site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis and is not associated with your profile.</p>
                <p>We may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our web site. This company may use information about your visit to this web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

                <h3>
                    How We Secure Information Transmissions</h3>
                <p>We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who have access to our servers, as well as installing electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk.</p>
                <h3>
                    Privacy Protections for Children Under the Age of 13 Using the Internet
                </h3>
                <p>Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information on our web site from those we actually know are under the age of 13, nor is any part of our web site targeted to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors to our web site who are under 13 not disclose or provide any personally identifiable information. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally identifiable information from our records.</p>
                <h3>Changes to Our Policies</h3>
                
                <p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy statement.
