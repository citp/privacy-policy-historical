###   
I. Overview

PayPal has developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we may collect, retain, process, share and transfer your Personal Data when you visit our Sites or use our Services.  This Privacy Policy applies to your Personal Data when you visit Sites or use Services, and does not apply to online websites or services that we do not own or control, including websites or services of other PayPal Users.

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you obtain information about our privacy practices and to help you understand your privacy choices when you use our Sites and Services.  Please note that our Service offerings may vary by region. 

We have defined some terms that we use throughout the Privacy Policy. You can find the meaning of a capitalized term in the Definitions section.

If you are an individual who resides in the United States of America and opens an account for one of our Services for your own personal, family or household purposes, you should also review our Consumer Privacy Notice to understand our privacy practices and the privacy choices we offer you.

Please contact us if you have questions about our privacy practices that are not addressed in this Privacy Policy.

### II. What Personal Data Do We Collect?

We may collect information about you when you visit our Sites or use our Services, including the following:

  * **Registration and use information –** When you register to use our Services by establishing an Account, we will collect Personal Data as necessary to offer and fulfill the Services you request.  Depending on the Services you choose, we may require you to provide us with your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and identification information to establish an Account.  We may require you to provide us with additional Personal Data as you use our Services.
  * **Transaction and experience information –** When you use our Services or access our Sites, for example, to make purchases from merchants, to receive money, to process payments, or to send money to friends and family, we collect information about the transaction, as well as other information associated with the transaction such as amount sent or requested, amount paid for products or services, merchant information, including information about any funding instruments used to complete the transaction, Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information.
  * **Participant information –** When you use our Services or access our Sites, we collect Personal Data you provide us about the other participants associated with the transaction. 
    * **Send or request money:  **When you send or request money through the Services, we collect Personal Data such as name, postal address, telephone number, and financial account information about the participant who is receiving money from you or sending money to you.  The extent of Personal Data required about a participant may vary depending on the Services you are using to send or request money. 
    * **Pay or request someone else to pay a bill:**  If you use our Services to pay a bill for the benefit of someone else, or if you request a User to pay a bill for you, we collect Personal Data from you about the account holder such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and account number of the bill that you intend to pay or request to be paid.
    * **Add value to your accounts:**  If you use our Services to add value to your Account or any other account you may have, or if you ask a User to add value to any of these accounts, we may collect Personal Data from you about the other party, or from the other party about you to facilitate the request.  For example, if you use our Services to reload a mobile phone, or to request value be added to your mobile account, we may collect Personal Data and other information including mobile account number from the other participant.
  * **Information about your friends and contacts –** It may be easier for us to help you transact with your friends and contacts if you provide Personal Data such as name, email address and telephone number about your friends and contacts while using a Service or if you connect your contact list or friend list to your Account.  If you choose to connect your contact list information on your device with your Account and/or establish an account connection between a social media platform and your Account, we will collect and use your contact list or friend list information to improve your experience when you use the Services. 
  * **Information that you choose to provide us to obtain additional Services or specific online Services –** If you request or participate in an optional Site feature, or request enhanced Services or other elective functionality, we may collect additional information from you.  We will provide you with a separate notice at the time of collection, if the use of that information differs from the uses disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 
  * **Information about you if you transact as a guest –** Certain limited Services are available without being required to log in to or establish an Account, also referred to as Guest Transactions.  We will collect Personal Data, information about any funding instrument used to complete a Guest Transaction, Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information as necessary to provide the requested Guest Transactions.  If you are an Account holder and choose to make a Guest Transaction, we will collect information about the transaction and may associate it with your Account.  If you are not an Account holder and choose to make a Guest Transaction, we will collect and store all information you provide and use and share such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### III.  Why Do We Retain Personal Data?

We retain Personal Data to fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations and for our business purposes.  We may retain Personal Data for longer periods than required by law if it is in our legitimate business interests and not prohibited by law.  If your Account is closed, we may take steps to mask Personal Data and other information, but we reserve our ability to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws.  We will continue to use and disclose such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  * **To manage risk and protect the Sites, the Services and you from fraud by verifying your identity,** and helping to detect and prevent fraud and abuse of the Sites or Services. 
  * **To market to you** by delivering marketing materials about PayPal products and online Services and the products and services of unaffiliated businesses.  We may also Process your Personal Data to tailor certain Services or Site experiences to better match our understanding of your interests.

  * **To provide you with location-specific options, functionality or offers** if you elect to share your Geolocation Information through the Services.  We will use this information to enhance the security of the Sites and Services and provide you with location-based Services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content.

  * **To respond to your requests,** for example to contact you about a question you submitted to our customer service team. 



### V.  Do We Share Personal Data? **  **

We may share your Personal Data or other information about you with others in a variety of ways as described in this section of the Privacy Policy. In addition, our Consumer Privacy Notice provides specific information about the reasons why we share the Personal Data of certain United States residents with unaffiliated third parties.

We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:

**With other members of the PayPal corporate family:** We may share your Personal Data with members of the PayPal family of entities to, among other things, provide the Services you have requested or authorized; to manage risk; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements; and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of PayPal products, Services, and communications.

**With other companies that provide services to us:** We may share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf.  These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and Services, or provide customer support. 

**With other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product or service:** We may share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product, such as with Synchrony Bank in connection with the PayPal Extras credit card.  These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses. 

**With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers:** We may share information with the other participants to your transactions, including other Users you are sending or receiving funds from, and merchants or their service providers when you use the Services to pay for goods or services.  The information includes:

  * Personal Data necessary to facilitate the transaction;


  * information to help other participant(s) resolve disputes and detect and prevent fraud; and
  * aggregated data and performance analytics to help merchants better understand Users and to help merchants enhance Users’ experiences. 



**With other third parties for our business purposes or as permitted or required by law:** We may share information about you with other parties for PayPal’s business purposes or as permitted or required by law, including:

  * if we need to do so to comply with a law, legal process or regulations;
  * to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, a court order or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or PayPal’s corporate family;
  * if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;


  * to protect the vital interests of a person;
  * to investigate violations of or enforce a user agreement or other legal terms applicable to any Service;
  * to protect our property, Services and legal rights;
  * to facilitate a purchase or sale of all or part of PayPal’s business;
  * in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using a Service;
  * to help assess and manage risk and prevent fraud against us, our Users and fraud involving our Sites or use of our Services, including fraud that occurs at or involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.;
  * to banking partners as required by card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants;
  * to credit reporting and collection agencies;
  * to companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by; and
  * to support our audit, compliance, and corporate governance functions.



**With your consent:** We also will share your Personal Data and other information with your consent or direction, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform. 

In addition, PayPal may provide aggregated statistical data to third-parties, including other businesses and members of the public, about how, when, and why Users visit our Sites and use our Services.  This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.  We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.   
 

### VI.  How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms? 

A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.  When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.  Examples of account connections include:

  * linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;
  * connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or
  * using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.



If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.  For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.  If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.  We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.  Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.  For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices. 

### VII.  How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?

When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online Services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a User and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services.  Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible. 

Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties.  We do not respond to DNT signals.

    * You may have an option regarding the use of cookies and other tracking technologies when you use a Service or visit parts of a Site.  For example, you may be asked if you want the Service or Site to “remember” certain things about you, and we will use cookies and other tracking technologies to the extent that you permit them.
    * You can learn more about our cookies and tracking technologies by visiting the [Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full) page.
  * **Choices Relating to Your Registration and Account Information**
