### Effective Date of Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 4/22/2013. 

Welcome to the Pyramid Collection website. We know you care how your personal information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust in us. 

By "personal information" we mean information that identifies you (such as your name, home address, billing address, telephone number, and email address). “Personal information” also includes descriptive information (such as your style preferences) if coupled with identifying information. 

What personal information do we collect at our website? 

There are two basic types of personal information collected at our website. There is the information you provide directly through the website and the information collected through technology. 

  1. Information Directly Provided by You

We may collect personal information directly from you such as your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, order information, and sizing information. This information may be collected in various places, such as when you visit our website and take any of the following actions:

We also use this information for reporting and analysis purposes in order to improve our business, to market products and services on our website and other websites and over various media, and to deliver products and services to you.
