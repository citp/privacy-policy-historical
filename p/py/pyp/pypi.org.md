This privacy policy will govern our use of your information, regardless of what information we collect.

If you are a supporting or sponsoring member of the PSF, or wish to make a donation, we will also ask for the information necessary to process a payment and reduce our risk of fraud. We may ask for other information, but providing such information is completely optional.

Voting Members (i.e. Contributing Members and Managing Members) will need to provide us with postal contact information during their enrollment. However, that information is never made generally available outside of the Foundation, neither on this website nor anywhere else public.

In particular, we may release the information we collect to third parties when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our legal rights, to protect the rights and safety of others, or to assist with industry efforts to control fraud, spam or other undesirable conduct.

If the PSF contracts with a third party to provide a particular service, we may release the information we collect to that third party, provided that the third party has agreed to use at least the same level of privacy protections described in this Privacy Policy, and is permitted to use the information only for the purpose of providing services to us.
