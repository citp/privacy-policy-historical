# Privacy Policy: PythonAnywhere

We take the privacy of our customers very seriously at PythonAnywhere. Most importantly, we do not and never will sell anyone's information to a third party. 

This Privacy Policy gives a few more details about how we collect, use, maintain and disclose information collected from you when you use our site. 

## Personal identification information

We may collect personal identification information from you in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when you visit our site, register on the site, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our site. Free users are asked for their email address when they sign up. If you sign up for a paid plan, the payment processor will provide us with a physical billing (postal) address. We will keep these details private. 

We will collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us by signing up or subscribing for a paid account. You can always refuse to supply the information, except that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities on our site. 

## Non-personal identification information

We may collect non-personal identification information about you whenever you interact with our site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about your means of connection to our site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. For the technically inclined — by this, we mean just the normal stuff that goes into our web server logs. These logs are deleted at least every 30 days, and frequently faster. 

## Web browser cookies

Our site uses cookies to enhance your experience. Your web browser places cookies on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about you. You may choose to tell your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do so, note that some parts of the site may not function properly. In particular, our login system uses cookies — so if you don't accept them, you won't be able to log in. 

## How we use collected information

We may collect and use your personal information for the following purposes: 

To improve customer service 
    Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently. 
To discover how people find and use our site 
    We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on our site. In particular, we use Google Analytics (which uses cookies) to find out where people found us (referring websites) and how much they use our site. 
To improve our site 
    We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. There wouldn't be much point in asking for it otherwise :-) 
To process payments 
    We use the information you provide about yourself (either directly or via our payment provider) when you sign up for a paid account solely to manage that paid account. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service or to comply with legal requirements (for example, if you used our site to hack into another site and the police turned up on our doorstep demanding to know who you were, we would hand over the details we have). 
To send periodic emails 
    We may use the email address to send you information and updates about the site. It may also be used to respond to your inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. Unless you decide to unsubscribe from our mailing list, you'll will receive (very occasional!) emails that may include product news, and updates. To be completely clear about this — you'll only get these from us, we'll never pass them on to "partners" or anything like that. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can do so by following the instructions in the email. 

## How we protect your information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our site. 

All communication between the site and you happens over an SSL secured channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. 

## Sharing your personal information

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, and trusted affiliates for the purposes outlined above. For example, if a partner wants to know how many of our users are in the US versus the number in the EU, we'll tell them. We won't tell them who you are. 

## Third party websites

Any other sites that we link to will have their own privacy policies, which might differ from ours. 

## Changes to this privacy policy

We have the right to update this privacy policy at any time. If we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page and email those users who are subscribed to our mailing list. If you unsubscribe from the list but want to know if this policy changes, you should check this page regularly. 

## Your acceptance of these terms

By using this site, you signify your acceptance of this policy and the [terms of service](https://web.archive.org/terms/). If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of the site following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes. 

## Contacting us
