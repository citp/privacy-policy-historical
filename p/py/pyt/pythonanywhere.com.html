           <h1>PRIVACY AND COOKIES POLICY</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date: 10 May 2018.</strong></p>
<p>1.  <strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>1.1  We are PythonAnywhere LLP. You can contact us at
    support@pythonanywhere.com. Other contact details are on our
    website.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>What's the point of this policy?</strong></p>
<p>2.1  It tells you what to expect when we collect your personal
    information. Please only use our service if you are completely
    happy with this policy.</p>
<p>2.2.  Generally, the policy covers only information provided to us. It
    doesn't cover personal information which you give to other people,
    such as payment providers or other websites. If you use them, please check
    their privacy policies. Nor does this policy apply to personal
    information of other people (e.g. customers) collected by users of
    our services. We just act as "data processors"; if necessary, please
    contact the service users, who are the "data controllers".</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Might the policy change?</strong></p>
<p>3.1  Yes. Please check whenever you visit our website. We will
    assume you agree to the new version of the policy if you use the
    site after its effective date.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>What do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>4.1  Information which you upload to our service or otherwise give us
    such as your name, username, email address and other contact
    details as well as any personal information which you include in
    public activities on our service, e.g. forum posts.</p>
<p>4.2  Your billing address as well as the last four digits and expiry date
    of your credit card, which may be sent to us by our payment
    providers.</p>

    used to connect your device to the internet, connection information
    such as browser type and version, information about your device
    including device-type and device identifier, operating system and
    platform, mobile network data, a unique reference number linked to
    the data you enter on our system, login details, the site from which
    you arrived at our service, details of your activity with date /
    time stamps including pages you visited and your searches /
    transactions.</p>
<p>4.4  Personal information of your customers or others which you choose to
    store on our servers in connection with our supply of services.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>What's our reason / legal basis for collecting the information?</strong></p>
<p>5.1  Because it's necessary to provide you with our services under
    our contract with you. We may use it for other purposes (such as
    email marketing) if you consent. In the case of automated
    information collected when you browse our site, we use this to
    manage and improve our service in accordance with our
    "legitimate interests".</p>

    messages may be related to your profile  — e.g., offering EU-hosted
    services to customers located in the EU or offering high performance
    services to users who making the most extensive use of our services.

    email us to request this if your account has already been
    deleted.</p>
<p>8.2  We may keep some limited information for up to six years after your
    account is closed  — for tax reasons and/or to help deal with any
    disputes. That timeframe may vary if we are legally required to keep

    requested by the police or other appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>9.4  To potential buyers so far as reasonably necessary, in the case of
    an actual or proposed (including negotiations for a) sale or merger

    business.</p>

    information, please contact us via the email address above. If you
