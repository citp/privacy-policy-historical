**Collection of Information**

I can col­lect per­son­ally iden­ti­fi­able in­for­ma­tion, like names, postal ad­dresses, email ad­dresses, etc., when vol­un­tar­ily sub­mit­ted by my vis­i­tors. This in­for­ma­tion is only used to ful­fill your spe­cific re­quest, un­less you give me per­mis­sion to use it in an­other man­ner. I never share any in­for­ma­tion with third par­ties, un­less re­quired by the law.

**Amazon Associates Program**

This web­site is a par­tic­i­pant in the Ama­zon Ser­vices LLC As­so­ci­ates Pro­gram. This means, in par­tic­u­lar, that if you fol­low a link to amazon.​com or any other na­tional ver­sion of Ama­zon web­site and then make a pur­chase within 24 hours, I will re­ceive a small per­cent­age of what you pay to Ama­zon (but your price will stay ex­actly the same).

I, how­ever, never link to spe­cific prod­ucts just in or­der to ad­ver­tize them. I link only to the prod­ucts that I gen­uinely find help­ful and the web­pages link­ing to such prod­ucts ex­press my hon­est opin­ion on the prod­ucts. In other words, I never rec­om­mend a prod­uct just in or­der to per­suade you to buy it; I rec­om­mend it be­cause I my­self find it use­ful.
