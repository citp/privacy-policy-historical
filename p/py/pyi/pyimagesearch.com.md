PyImageSearch (the “Company”) respects the privacy concerns of the users of its website, https://www.pyimagesearch.com and the services provided therein (the “Site”). The Company thus provides this privacy statement to explain what information is gathered during a visit to the Site and how such information may be used.

**Use of Information:** As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Site.
