### 6\. How Long We Store Your Information

We store your data only for as long as we need access to it in order to fulfill the purpose of the specific data processing activity. As the data retention period is different from use case to use case we have created a separate document with all our processing activities, in which you can find the exact period for each of the processing activities that we perform. On top of that and where possible we have applied a general rule inside Quintly that all personal data should be deleted or anonymized if you haven't been using our Websites and Services for more than 9 months. Exceptions to this rules only apply if there are technical limitations to guarantee this or where specific laws expect from us that we store the data for a longer time (e.g., requirements from tax authorities for storing documents).
