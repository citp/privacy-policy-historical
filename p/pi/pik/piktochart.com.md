# Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions | Piktochart

### Your Privacy Matters

 _This new policy came into effect on **May 25th, 2018**._

At Piktochart, we are committed to being transparent about the data we collect about you, why we collect it, how we process it, and who we share it with. We take the utmost care in handling your data and ensuring that your privacy is safeguarded.

By using our services, you consent to our use of your data as stated here in this privacy policy. The policy applies to any registered user, visitor to the Piktochart platform including the web application, website, blog pages, and any other service we provide.

##### 1\. A Visual Summary

##### 2\. Introduction

Through our updated privacy policy, that accounts for the new EU data laws regarding General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we aim to provide you with better ways to access your data, understand how it’s used, and choose whether or not to subscribe to certain communication materials we send your way. We hope the new policy is clear and easily digestible.

##### 3\. Information We Collect

###### 3.1 Information You Provide Us

###### Registration

When creating an account with Piktochart, you provide the following details:

  1. Email Address – This is required to create a unique account in Piktochart for you to access the application.
  2. Name – This is used during communications in order to address you, and also to name your workspace within Piktochart so that you can differentiate between your personal and team workspace (if you are subscribed for one). Your name is also displayed in published visuals and is visible to people who can access them.
  3. Password – Along with your email, a password is required to authenticate and provide access to your Piktochart account. However, we do not store any passwords when you sign up or sign in using social media logins.
  4. Registering via Social Accounts – You can create an account with Piktochart using your social media accounts. We currently support social media login with Google or Facebook. When you choose to sign up using your social media account, we collect and store your email address and name from the social media platform along with an UID (unique ID received from the social media platform).
  5. Extended Profile – We collect your role, organization size and whether you belong to a non-profit organization. The role is used to help us design templates, provide tips, and design features that might be beneficial for that role. For example, knowing that we have registered users in a marketing role helps us develop templates for say social media marketing or marketing metrics reporting. Information on organization size helps guide our marketing efforts and design features that might help in collaboration as a part of the Piktochart For Teams plan. The non-profit indicator helps us direct you to discounted pricing plans if you choose to upgrade to a premium plan. It is up to you whether you want to provide this information. Providing this information helps you get more relevant templates, tailored tips to get your job done better, and over the long run, shape the features in the product that serve your needs better.



###### Billing

If you subscribe to any of the premium plans in Piktochart, then we collect your credit card details along with other billing information (like company name and address). These are required to authorize the payment to the premium plans and also to generate invoices. The credit card and other payment information is not stored within Piktochart. We encrypt the information and share it with the payment gateway to process the transaction.

###### Visitor

We place cookies on all of Piktochart’s pages to perform web analytics with the intention of improving site experience. Refer to the Cookie Policy section on what we track and collect. Visitors (who might be existing users of Piktochart) can subscribe to newsletters from our blog, download content, or unlock articles we create in collaboration with our partners by providing their contact information which includes email address and name. The collected data is used to send the requested content and/or newsletter and we do not sell this data to any third parties.

Upon account deletion and/or request for data erasure, we’ll still retain a bare minimum of your personal data that is reasonably necessary to resolve any disputes, and to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
