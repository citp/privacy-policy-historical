We may keep some of your personally identifiable information to the extent needed to be in compliance with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and enforce any agreements we have with you;

_Information you have shared on the Services_ \- We retain personally identifiable information from deleted and deactivated accounts as required to allow other users of the Services to continue to make use of the Services. For example, (i) your name will continue to appear on any messages you have sent to other users of the Services after account deletion and any posts you have made will continue to appear, or (ii) where your name or other personally identifiable information has been added to the Service by you or another user other than in association with your account (such as where your name has been added, with authority, as the founder of a startup and such record is not specifically linked to your account). You acknowledge and confirm that this may result in certain personally identifiable information remaining on the Service in these circumstances.

Apart from what we’ve described above, we’ll archive and stop actively using any personal identifiable information about you within a reasonable length of time (usually one year) of your last use of the Service. We’ll do our best to make it happen more quickly. We’ll also delete your personal data from our archives within one year from your last use of the Services in respect to all use of the Services other than professional services. Due to our compliance obligations, for professional services we’ll delete your personal data from our archives within ten years from your last use of the Services.

**How we store your information**

We collect information globally and store that information in the European Union (Vienna, London and Frankfurt) on our own servers and that of our service providers as part of providing the Services. These service providers are based inside the European Economic Area. We do not store or transfer personally identifiable information outside the EEA.

**Security of your information**

We take security of your data seriously and work hard to avoid loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure. No security system is perfect and despite our efforts and the distributed nature of the Internet, we can’t guarantee that your personal data will be absolutely secure, either while it is being transmitted or while stored on our systems. 

**Access and Control of your Information**

You have rights with respect to your personally identifiable information. We have compiled a list of choices below that you may make with additional information on how to make them happen.

You have the right to:

\- request access to personally identifiable information we hold about you;

\- deactivate your account;

\- update your personally identifiable information;

\- delete your personally identifiable information;

\- ask us to stop using your personally identifiable information;

\- ask us not to use your personally identifiable information to profile you or make automated decisions about you;

\- stop receiving communications from us; and

\- ask us to port your data to another service provider if technically feasible, or to provide you with a copy of personally identifiable information we hold about you in a structured, electronic format.

You can accomplish most of these directly using the tools we provide to you as part of the Service. If you are unable to do so using the tools we provide, please contact our support through the help section of our website, or e-mail us at support@pioneers.io. Depending on the choices you make, it may not be possible for us to continue to provide you with the Services after we implement your choices. This may result is us closing your account or your use of the Services being limited or not possible.

### Business uses of our Services

You understand and agree that your continued access to or use of our Services after the effective date of modifications to the Terms indicates your acceptance of the modifications.
