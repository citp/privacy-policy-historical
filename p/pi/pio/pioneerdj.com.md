### Your Choices and Privacy Settings 

You may decline to share certain personal information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of our Services. 

Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request access to and receive information about the personal information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information, and have the information blocked or deleted, as appropriate. The right to access personal information may be limited in some circumstances by local law requirements.

We give you several methods to access, correct, update or request blocking or deletion of your personal information including:

  * You may access, update or correct certain personal information and privacy settings at any time by accessing the account settings section in your profile page on our Websites or mobile app.

Even after you opt out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative and security messages from us regarding the Services.

##### Notice to California residents

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information regarding disclosure within the immediately preceding calendar year of that California resident's personal information to third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as we do, by disclosing in its privacy policy that we provide consumers with a choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties' and affiliates' direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. At this time, we do not share personally identifiable information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties' or affiliates' direct marketing purposes. If we do so in the future, we will provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time we offer that choice, we will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.

##### Note to EEA residents

You have the right, subject to the payment of a small fee (currently £10), to request access to personal data that we may process about you. If you wish to exercise this right, you should:

  * put your request in writing;
  * include proof of your identity and address (eg a copy of your driving licence or passport, and a recent utility or credit card bill);
  * arrange payment of any fee to Pioneer DJ; and
  * specify the personal data you want access to, including any account or reference numbers where applicable.



You have the right to require us to correct any inaccuracies in your data free of charge. If you wish to exercise this right, you should:

  * put your request in writing;
  * provide us with enough information to identify you (eg account number, user name, registration details); and
  * specify the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.



You also have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you wish to exercise this right, you should:

  * put your request in writing (an email sent to [exec.eu@pioneerdj.com](mailto:exec.eu@pioneerdj.com) with a header that says 'Unsubscribe' is acceptable);
  * provide us with enough information to identify you (eg account number, user name, registration details); and
  * if your objection is not to direct marketing in general, but to direct marketing by a particular channel (eg email or telephone), please specify the channel you are objecting to.



##### Do-Not-Track Signals

Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other "Do Not Track" ("DNT") mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site. 

##### Data Security

We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Services.

##### Children's Privacy

Our Services are not directed to individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at [privacy@pioneerdj.com](mailto:privacy@pioneerdj.com).

##### Third-Party Services

Our Services may contain features or links to web sites and services provided by third parties, including services that facilitate the purchase of songs and music albums. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such sites or services and is subject to those operators' policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Services. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided. We encourage you to learn about third parties' privacy and security policies before providing them with information.

##### International users

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which it was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the personal information. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are located in the European Economic Area, we comply with applicable legal requirements for the transfer of personal information outside of the country of collection. By providing your personal information or using our Services, you consent to any transfer of personal information to countries outside of your country of residence, in particular to Japan and the United States.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy and where appropriate we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the log-in screen or sending you an email notification). Your continued use of our Services after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to the current version of this Policy. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, do not use any Websites and Service.
