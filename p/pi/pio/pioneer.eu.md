We request personal identifiable information when you register a product, request a service, answer a survey, enter a contest, correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on the above mentioned websites.

You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested personal information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction.

Similarly, when you visit our websites, we will collect information known as "clickstreams" (IP address, domain name, etc). This information, combined with the details you have provided us with, enables us to customize your visits better.

  
**2\. How do we use the information we collect?**

We use personal information in the following ways :  
1\. To provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services, newsletters, informative emails and research on future product ideas or improvements;

**3\. How do we protect your personal information ?**

In order to guarantee the security of your personal information we have set in place a series of security measures and safeguards. Your personal information is stored on secure networks that may only be accessed by a limited number of persons holding special access rights and who undertake to respect and maintain its confidential nature.

Despite these measures, whenever you provide personal information on the Internet, there is always a risk that it may be intercepted and used by third persons whom we are unable to control. Although we make every effort to protect your personal information and privacy, we are unable to guarantee the security of the information you make available over the internet.

  
**4\. Who has access to your personal information and to what extent?**

In addition to the companies mentioned and for the purposes described above, we do not sell, trade or transfer your personal information in any form to third parties without informing you first and in accordance with the personal information protection legislation currently in effect.

Your personal information may be transferred to outside contractors to provide services for us. They may be used to provide technical support. We require that these contractors keep your personal information secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors use personal information only on behalf of PIONEER EUROPE NV.

At all time you may opt out for the sharing of your personal information with third parties. This can be done via the account page of our online registration area.

When you submit a product review, your nickname and country can be openly viewed by others. Depending on your Shared settings, which can be changed at any time via the account page of our online registration area, you also share your first name, photo, and links.
