**GENERAL**

We at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., ("Pioneer") are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal information or data of all visitors to this web site. As a part of that commitment, Pioneer is in the process of implementing its Information Privacy Policy for the United States and Canada. This Statement is intended to let our visitors and customers know what business information and personal information about them we collect at this Pioneer web site, www.Pioneer.com/growingpoint (the "Pioneer Site") why we collect it, and the purposes for which it is used and disclosed. At this Pioneer Site, Pioneer collects information in a number of ways:

**BUSINESS INFORMATION**

**How does Pioneer collect business information?**   
At this Pioneer Site, Pioneer primarily collects information about our customers' business/farm operations such as address, phone numbers, employees, acres, crop protection used, etc. If the information requested relates to your farming operation(s), it is generally considered business information, not personal information. Additionally, we collect similar business information about the businesses that support our customers, such as crop consultants, professional farm managers, agricultural retailer's and distributors, food and feed processors, grain merchandisers, elevators, and coops to name a few.

Pioneer takes the information we collect at this Pioneer Site and syncs it up with our databases to provide you with a customized look and service that includes providing you with information specific to your operation or business. For example, as a customer you will receive weather and agronomic information specific to your region as well as identifying the Pioneer sales contact in your area. Additionally, we can provide you with information about products specific to your area and needs.

**How does Pioneer use the business information it has collected from you?**   
Pioneer uses the information we collect on this Pioneer Site to provide you and the businesses that support you with services related to the Pioneer Site. Pioneer may use any of the business information gathered at this Pioneer Site for any legal purposes, including but not limited to, for direct marketing; or we may also analyze it for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, or we may store it for your convenience should you return to this site in the future.

**To whom will Pioneer provide your business information?**   
We may provide your business information to Pioneer affiliates or other third parties for a number of purposes, including but not limited to circumstances where we believe sharing that information may result in your having access or connection to services and products that enhance your operation, or instances that include expanding the options you have for selling your products. Additionally, we may share business information to investigate security breaches, or to co-operate with authorities pursuant to a legal matter.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**What is Personal Information?**   
Personal information is any information about an identifiable person, other than the name, title or business address or telephone number, or other business contact information of an employee of an organization ("Personal Information"). Personal Information does not include business information. Except as detailed in Section IV on collection through use of Technology, when Pioneer collects Personal Information, it will ask for your consent at the point of collection and reference you to this Statement detailing the purposes for which Pioneer collects, uses and discloses such Personal Information. An example of a location where we might collect Personal Information and you would receive a notice asking for your consent would be the Country Store.

**What Personal Information does Pioneer collect and how does Pioneer use the Personal Information?**   
Personal Information is collected and used in accordance with this Statement and the Information Privacy Policy. For example, at this Pioneer Site, we collect information that may be personal at the pages titled Registration Form, Set Preferences, Contact Us, Country Store, Seed Information Requests, and Product Selection. Pioneer syncs up the information provided by you with our database and our sales representatives to determine if you are one of our business customers or business prospects or a business that supports our customers. If there is a match, your information is used in accordance with our practices detailed above under Part II above, "Business Information."

In situations where these choices or preferences need to be used again; they can be supplied to us by your machine automatically, saving you time and effort.
