# Online CRM-Privacy & Security Policy | PipelineDeals | PipelineDeals

PipelineDeals, Inc. ( "PipelineDeals ") is committed to protecting your privacy. We take privacy very seriously here at PipelineDeals and post this PipelineDeals Privacy & Security Policy ( "Policy ") to explain our policy and what PipelineDeals does with the personal information that we collect from individuals that visit and use our website and the applications and services offered by PipelineDeals (the "Services ").

### What Information We collect and Why:

Our vision at PipelineDeals is to introduce visitors to the benefits of our services and to facilitate contact management for all of our customers ( "Account Holders ") and our collection and use of your information is intended to help us achieve these objectives.

During your visit to the PipelineDeals website, we may capture certain information about you. Upon sign up with PipelineDeals (for a trial or for purchasing the service), you may be required to provide your name, billing address, email address, password, and login id (which you create in the registration process). In addition, we may capture your company name, billing phone number, time zone, date format, time format and credit card information so you may subscribe to and pay for the Service, but we do not store any credit card information. All credit card information is stored by a third party credit card processor. All recurring credit card charges (either monthly or yearly) are authorized in advance by the customer. At sign up you also create your own log in id and password that is known only to you and PipelineDeals. PipelineDeals strongly discourages the sharing of your login id and password with anyone. You, the Account Holder, are responsible for the safety and security of your login id and password.

Any information you or anyone with your login id and password upload into the Services in the form of files, contact information, industry knowledge, maps, financial information, and the like remains your sole and exclusive property, and we will not authorize any third party to access that information except as authorized pursuant to this Policy. Please note that this information is also subject to the PipelineDeals Terms and Conditions of Use which may be found at: http://www.pipelinedeals.com/terms.

As you navigate the PipelineDeals website (whether or not you register as a user), information may be collected automatically through the use of commonly used information gathering tools such as cookies (imbedded code that recognizes your browser), web beacons (clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information) and other existing or future tracking technology. Additionally, we collect standard information from your Web browser, such as browser type, your internet protocol address and actions you have taken on our website (i.e., pages viewed and clicked links). Periodically, PipelineDeals may conduct webinars or other similar web events in which information may be collected (through our website or a third party service such as Citrix’s Gotomeeting). In order to participate in such events, you are required to provide your name, email address, number of employees, and how you heard about the web event. In addition, PipelineDeals may capture the following information: address, phone number, industry, organization name and role in the purchase process. Generally speaking, the information we collect helps us provide the requested services and improve the website and deliver a better more personalized service to you. These collection tools and how they are used are described in further detail below.
