**How does Piperlime use my information?**  
When you make a purchase from Piperlime, we use your personal information to process your order, send you e-mails to confirm your order or contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order or purchase.

When you place an order, make a purchase or save your information online, we may use your e-mail and postal address to send you information about our products, services, contests, and promotions, and to learn more about your shopping preferences. If you participate in a contest or promotion (online or over the phone), we may use your personal information to send you e-mails, postal mail, or telephone (including text messages) regarding our products, services, contests and promotions. From time to time, we may use this information to contact you via e-mail, postal mail, or telephone to learn more about your shopping preferences. You always have the choice not to receive marketing information or calls.

In addition, we may use information about your product interests and purchases from us and our affiliates, including without limitation, Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Forth & Towne, to help us improve our site design and your online shopping experiences.

**Does Piperlime share my information with third parties?**  
We will not share your email address with unrelated third parties for their marketing purposes. If you shop at one of our affiliates (including, without limitation, Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Forth & Towne), we share information about you with that affiliate, so that it can communicate with you by e-mail or postal mail about their products, services, contests and promotions that may be of interest to you. Each of our affiliates has a privacy policy that is consistent with our own.

At Piperlime, subject to any choice you have made, from time to time we may provide your name, postal address, and information about your interests to unaffiliated companies whose products we think might interest you. Although our affiliates (including, without limitation, Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Forth & Towne) may share personal information about you with Piperlime, we do not share that information with any unaffiliated third party.

We also contract with service providers to maintain and manage our customer information, to fulfill promotions and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use of your information.

In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we may compare our customer list with theirs to identify our common customers. Both Piperlime and our marketing partners may use that information to fulfill our respective obligations to you and for future promotional activities.

When we offer contests and promotions, with or without a marketing partner, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive e-mail messages or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. In this case, however, Piperlime may still need to contact you, for example, to notify winners and to fulfill promotional obligations.

Piperlime may participate in Scrip programs that allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Third party loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Piperlime, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty, or other similar program in which Piperlime is a participating vendor, the company administering the scrip, loyalty, or other similar program (collectively, the "scrip company") should provide a link on its website that permits you to authorize Piperlime or our credit card processor(s) to provide information about your Piperlime purchases. The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip company will include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide. Please note that once Piperlime discloses this information, the scrip company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.

In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, Piperlime will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

Piperlime reserves the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Piperlime, its affiliates, and others.
