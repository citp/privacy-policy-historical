	<h3 class="red">PipelineDeals.com Privacy &amp; Security Policy</h3>

	<p class="highlight_box gray_top_border gray_bottom_border">Effective May 1, 2006</p>

	<h3 class="red">Our Commitment to Privacy:</h3>

	<p>In short, PipelineDeals.com will never sell, rent, lease or otherwise monetize your personal information. We do not and will not violate our customer’s trust. For further details, please read on.</p>
	<p>PipelineDeals.com is committed to respecting your privacy and taking all reasonable efforts to protect your information. We take Privacy very seriously here at PipelineDeals.com and post this Privacy Notice to explain our Privacy Policy and explain what we do with the personal information that we collect from our users. Please take the time to review this notice and check back as we reserve the right to update it from time to time. Any future changes made will still adhere to our over-arching policy to never use, sell, rent or otherwise disclose the information given by a user in a personally identifiable manner.</p>

	<h3 class="red">What data we collect and why:</h3>

	<p>Our vision at PipelineDeals.com is to facilitate contact management for all of our Account Holders.</p>
	<p>Upon sign up with PipelineDeals.com, you have the option to provide your name, billing address, password, and login id. We capture your credit card information so you may subscribe to our service, but we do not store that information.  At sign up you also create your own log in id and password that is known only to you and PipelineDeals.com. PipelineDeals.com strongly discourages the sharing of your login id and password with anyone. You, the Account Holder, are responsible for the safety and security of your login id and password.</p>
	<p>Any information you or anyone with your login id and password upload into PipelineDeals.com in the form of files, contact information, industry knowledge, maps, financial information, etc remains your sole and exclusive property. Please note that this information is subject to the PipelineDeals.com Terms of Service which may be found at this link: http://www.pipelinedeals.com/terms.htm</p>

	<h3 class="red">Who sees your personal information:</h3>

	<p>Only those PipelineDeals.com employees trained in our security processes with managerial oversight would ever have access to your personal information defined as Name, Billing Address, Login ID and Password. Our employees will not have access to your credit card information. Primarily this information is accessed to provide customer service and resolve any issues that may arise.</p>
	<p>We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services. These contractors or vendors are bound to adhere to our Privacy Policy and all of the restrictions on PipelineDeals.com information pertain to them as well.</p>

	<h3 class="red">How we keep your information secure:</h3>

	<p>PipelineDeals.com uses reasonable efforts to protect your information including a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you transmit personal data to us. Whenever you access any of your account pages or change any of your user information, it is done over an SSL connection to PipelineDeals.com. All data transfer to (upload) or from (download) will be done over a SSL connection using a current certificate. </p>
	<p>In addition, your data is protected at our secure date centers.  We maintain our servers in secure, data centers in two (2) separate geographical locations.  The data centers are staffed 24x7. Your data is replicated in both data centers in real-time thus always providing a redundant backup of your data.  </p>

	<h3 class="red">How can you retrieve your data &amp; data backups:</h3>

	<p>Our databases are backed up daily.  In addition, we maintain a separate backup production facility that replicates our databases in real-time.  Further, you can access and export your data at any time into a standard XML file format.</p>

	<h3 class="red">Your privacy with PipelineDeals.com:</h3>

	<p>PipelineDeals.com will never ask for your login id, password or any other personal information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. Should any one contact you requesting such information, please contact PipelineDeals.com directly via email at: customercare@PipelineDeals.com.</p>
	<p>Further, any contact with PipelineDeals.com customer service in which personal information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying that request. Any personal information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request without your consent.</p>

	<h3 class="red">Your privacy with our advertisers:</h3>

	<p>PipelineDeals.com contains links to various other sites. Each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of PipelineDeals.com. The privacy practices of other websites linked to PipelineDeals.com are not covered by this privacy policy.</p>
	<p>PipelineDeals.com will not disclose any of the personal information supplied upon registration to any other third party except as expressly mentioned in this Notice. This information will not be released by PipelineDeals.com to other parties unless required by law.</p>

	<h3 class="red"> Our policies on email:</h3>

If you would like to report an incident of spamming, please contact customercare@PipelineDeals.com. We will investigate and take suitable action at our discretion. PipelineDeal.com does advertise via email from time to time. Any email PipelineDeals.com sends will fully comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.</p>
	<p>Please understand that, though we may have some small influence over our Account Holders, we fundamentally cannot control the online or offline actions of our Account Holders or other parties, especially when it comes to their use of email or participation in moderated or unmoderated newsgroups and forums, known on PipelineDeals.com as “Forums�?. While we will investigate complaints sent to customercare@PipelineDeals.com and take appropriate action with our Account Holders or other parties, we will typically not provide any information to third parties about our conversations with our Account Holders.
