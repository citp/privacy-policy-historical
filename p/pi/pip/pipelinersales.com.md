# Privacy | Pipeliner CRM

This document describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our website, software, and services ("Services").

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services: 

_Account._ We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers. 

_Services._ When you use our Services, we store, process and transmit your files and information related to them. If you give us access to your contacts, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use. This makes it easy for you to do things like share, send emails, and invite others to use the Services. 

_Usage._ We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our site, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. 

_Cookies and other technologies._ We use technologies like cookies and tracking software to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. 

_Worldwide Data Storage._ To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit information in locations around the world - including those outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.

We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third-parties. Email addresses are not for sale or trade and are strictly guarded. 

_Others working for Pipelinersales._ Pipelinersales uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. 

_Other users._ Our Services display information like your name and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. Certain features let you make additional information available to other users. 

_Other applications._ You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via through our Apps Marketplace. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. 

_Administrators._ If you are a Pipeliner CRM user, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your account. Please refer to your employer's internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not a Pipeliner CRM user but interact with a Pipeliner CRM user, members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address and IP address that were associated with your account at the time of that interaction. 

_Disclosure Conditions._ We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Pipeliner CRM or our users; or (d) protect Pipelinersales Inc.’s property rights. 

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive.

 _Security._ We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. 

_Retention._ We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and backup storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. 

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event. 

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
