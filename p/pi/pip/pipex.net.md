##### When do we collect information about you?

When you register for information or place an order with TalkTalk Business, we may need to collect certain information in order to provide the information you have requested or to process your order. What we need varies depending on the type of enquiry you make or what you have ordered, and the pages you are asked to complete will vary accordingly. This information is sent to us via an SSL encrypted server and will form part of a permanent record of your dealings with us.

When you e-mail us, we may ask for certain information to be able to confirm your identity, check our records and answer your questions quickly and accurately. When you contact us, in any way, we may make a note of this contact if it is relevant to your permanent records. This allows us to provide a higher level of ongoing customer care.

When you download or use mobile applications created by TalkTalk Business or any other companies in the TalkTalk Group Limited group of companies and, where applicable, have requested or consented to location services, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as search results, and other personalised content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. Our mobile application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.

We will keep your personal details given to us by you or others during your relationship with both us and other companies in the TalkTalk Group Limited group of companies (including our mobile and insurance companies).
