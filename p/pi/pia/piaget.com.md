**_What is a cookie?_**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or mobile application. They are used to recognize your computer as you move between pages on a website, or when you return to a website or mobile application you have visited previously. Cookies are widely used in order to make platforms work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the platform. 

We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for example, by remembering your language and/or product preferences) and to better understand how our Platform is used. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Platform before or whether you are a new visitor.

There are two broad categories of cookies: 

  * · **First party cookies,** served directly by Piaget to your computer or mobile device. They are used only by Piaget to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Platform.

Third party cookies are most commonly used for platform analytics or advertising purposes. 



Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Piaget uses both 'session cookies' and ‘permanent cookies’.
