## 7 – With whom do we share your personal data?

7.1 We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third party.

7.2 Generally the third-party services we use only collect and use information needed to allow them to deliver the services we hired them for. These parties are:

  * Service providers who provide IT and system administration service.
  * Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal insurance and accounting services.
  * Customs, regulations and other authorities based in Sweden and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.



7.3 We share your personal data within our group of companies and many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The third parties service providers processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Countries outside of the EEA do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria, see description in section 7.4.

7.4 Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data by the European Commission; or
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certificate mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
  * Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.



If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw your personal data out of the EEA. Please email us at [info@pixpro.net](mailto:info@pixpro.net) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

9.2 To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm for unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
