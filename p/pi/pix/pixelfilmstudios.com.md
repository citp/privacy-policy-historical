This Privacy Policy applies to Company’s websites that link to this Policy. By using this Site you are accepting and consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any terms, please do not use this Site or submit any personal information. 

#### Children’s Privacy

This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Site. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on the Site, we will delete the information from our records.

#### Information We Collect

Information collected by Company falls into two categories: (1) information that users voluntarily submit in connection with their use of the Site; and (2) tracking information recorded as a visitor or user navigates the Site.   
In connection with your use of the Site, you may choose to provide certain personal information. This information may include your name, address, phone number(s), email address, and credit card information (such as name, card number, expiration date and CVV code).  
We also collect tracking information that records visitors’ interactions with the Site. Like most Web site servers we use log files. Log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We match log file information with the personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit on the Site. 

Pages on our Site may contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the data that is collected through web beacons and match it with the personally identifiable information you submit to the Site.

We may use cookies to collect information about your interaction with the Site. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computer and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies record information about your online preferences. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services to our Clients. We may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners.
