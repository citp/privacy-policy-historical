This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve the Users of Services provided by Pixers LTD (“ **We** ”) on the [pixers.us](https://pixers.us/) website, who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is used online. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. BY USING ANY PORTION OF OUR SERVICE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

At the same time, it should be noted that this privacy policy fulfills the information obligation under Art. 13 of the Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (Journal of Laws of the EU 2016 No. 119, p. 1), hereinafter referred to as "GDPR".

## WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM USERS OF OUR SERVICES?

The types of information that we collect fall under two general categories: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). PII consists of any information which can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas non-PII consists of aggregate information or any information that does not reveal your identity. The following sections describe how your PII and non-PII are collected by us, and how we use such information. The above information may be associated with you, if you choose to give us personal data about yourself as described in the Terms of Service and if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of legal action, some third parties such as your Internet provider could match our anonymous technical information with you, using information beyond what is found on our servers.

We may also use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server's interaction with your computer, and we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

## WHAT TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

The User may also consent to receiving marketing notifications by means of web-push notifications through their web browser. In such a case, the controller does not process the User's personal data because he only uses data that is stored in the browser's memory at the time of use.
