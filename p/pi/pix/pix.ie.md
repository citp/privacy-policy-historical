# Privacy Policy on Pixie Photo Sharing!

Pix.ie (“Pixie”, “Site”, “Website”) is a photo sharing community. Our site makes it really easy for you to share your photos with people of your choice, e.g. your friends, family.

We understand however that you may not wish to share this experience with "everyone" on the Internet and because we take your privacy very seriously we provide you with the ability to decide with whom you would like to share your photos and information. We provide extensive privacy control that enables you to segment your audience into groups, allowing for instance, your family to view "most" of your photos ;) but not all... and your friends, well, to view them all! Whatever you decide!

Pixie fully respects your right to privacy and will not collect any personal information about you on this website without your clear permission. Any personal information which you volunteer will be treated with the highest standards of security and confidentiality and in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. This Statement relates to our privacy practices in connection with this website. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites. Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such. Some technical terms used in this statement are explained at the end of this page.

This document is subject to the Terms & Conditions of Use document located at <http://pix.ie/terms>.

* ### We want you to have control over the personal information you want to share.

### We want you to have control over the personal information you want to share.

Pixie provides you with the ability to create a personal profile. This profile contains information about you (including your photos) that you have submitted or uploaded for the purpose of sharing with others.

With each feature, we normally provide you with privacy control allowing you to specify with fine details to whom and for what purpose access is granted. Privacy has three settings:

  * "Private" – Other users cannot view your information.
  * "Protected" – Only accessible to your Contacts, e.g. Friends, Family.
  * "Public" – Accessible to everyone on the internet.


* ### You should have access to the information others want to share with you.

### You should have access to the information others want to share with you.

Sharing is a two way street! We want to make it easy for you to be able to access the photos and information that others want to share with you. As well as providing easy methods of discovering new Content, we also provide you with handy notifications whenever your Contacts want to share something with you.

* ### Our Privacy Policy

### Our Privacy Policy

The following policy sets out what we do with the information you provide to us while visiting the Site in order to help you make an informed choice about whether or not to use this site.

* ### The Information We Collect

### The Information We Collect

By visiting and using Pixie, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you choose to disclose when signing up or administering your profile and web site usage information collected by us as you use the Site.

By signing up with Pixie, you provide us with personal information, for instance your name, email address, gender, date of birth, place of residence and any other personal or preference information that your provide to us.

All visitors to Pixie will have their IP address, top-level domain used, the previous website address from which you visited us (including any search terms used), data which shows the traffic of visitors to the Site, browser type and browser capabilities recorded. This information is collected by us in order to provide the service. In order to facilitate you with a login and a session, we also place cookies, one or more tiny text files on your computer. These cookies may persist beyond your usage of the Site, but can be removed at any time without affecting your ability to use your computer or the Site. You should note that technical details which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual do not constitute “personal data” for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

Our service provides you with the facility to set up a personal profile, upload photos, create groups, vote on Content, send messages, post comments, perform searches and transmit information through various channels. In order to facilitate these features and provide a more personalised experience, we need to collect and store information. For example, you can visit the profile of one of your Contact, view and leave comments on their photos. You may also discover other friends that are also using the service and link these users to your own account.

In certain circumstances, when you update your information, we create a backup copy of the previous version. This backup enables us to help you recover lost information should the need arise.

By using pix.ie and submitting information to pix.ie, you do so at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your photos and information. Therefore we cannot and do not guarantee that the information you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorised persons. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site either as a result of malicious intrusion or any other means. You understand and acknowledge that even after removal, other users may still have copies of your information, it may still be found in search engine caches and other sources around the internet over which we have no control.

All data is stored and processed in the Republic of Ireland.

* ### Use of Information Obtained by Pixie

### Use of Information Obtained by Pixie

Pixie is an online community of users whose primary reason for using the service is to share information (including their photos) with others. You can make informed choices about who has access to your information by setting your own privacy options. As part of the service you may be notified when new information is available to view and to facilitate this, we may send you an email or other form of communication. Should you not wish to receive communications from us, you may opt out by setting the appropriate settings on your account. We do however reserve the right to send you notifications about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary notifications.

Generally, we use the information gathered from our visitors in an aggregate form to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and help us better design and organise the Site. In addition, we may use the information you provide to us in a variety of ways that enable us to better operate, maintain and provide you with the features and functionality of Pixie.

We may also share information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. For example, we may provide advertisers with hints as to what might be the most appropriate advert for a certain category of user. This ultimately provides you with a more personalised service without compromising your privacy.

* ### Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

### Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is (a) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (b) is in our legitimate business interests, (c) legally required or (d) consented to by you. For example: Our site contains RSS feeds that syndicate your information (including photos and comments) to outside subscribers with appropriate access. Public feeds contain only "Public" information while private feeds contain information appropriate to the subscriber's account permissions.

We don't do everything in house! Therefore it may be necessary to provide our service providers with information in order for us to be able to provide you with the service. Where we utilise third parties in this regard, we implement contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to that directly required for providing our service to you and requiring compliance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

In the event of merger with another company or acquisition by another company, you will be notified before any information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

* ### Children

### Children

We take the privacy of children very seriously. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children on the Site. If we are informed that personally identifiable information of children has been collected without the consent of a parent or guardian, we will take reasonable steps to delete any such information.

* ### Security

### Security

We take appropriate precautions to protect your personal information. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.

* ### Your rights regarding your information

### Your rights regarding your information

You can modify or delete any of your profile information at any time by logging into your account. Information will be updated within a reasonable time. You can delete your Pixie account by emailing us at support@pix.ie . Be aware that even after your account has been deleted, information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to other users.

You have the right to be given a copy of your personal data which you may have supplied to the Site. To exercise this right, you must write to Pixie or email support@pix.ie and should include any personal identifiers which you have provided to the Site (e.g. name, address, email address).
