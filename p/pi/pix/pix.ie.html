                <p>Pix.ie (“Pixie”, “Site”, “Website”) is a photo sharing community. Our site makes
                    it really easy for you to share your photos with people of your choice, e.g. your
                    friends, family.</p>
                <p>We understand however that you may not wish to share this experience with "everyone"
                    on the Internet and because we take your privacy very seriously we provide you with
                    the ability to decide with whom you would like to share your photos and information.
                    We provide extensive privacy control that enables you to segment your audience into
                    groups, allowing for instance, your family to view "most" of your photos ;) but
                    not all... and your friends, well, to view them all! Whatever you decide!</p>

                        <p>Pixie provides you with the ability to create a personal profile. This profile contains
                            information about you (including your photos) that you have submitted or uploaded
                            for the purpose of sharing with others.</p>
                        <p>With each feature, we normally provide you with privacy control allowing you to specify
                            with fine details to whom and for what purpose access is granted. Privacy has three
                            settings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Private" – Other users cannot view your information.</li>

                            <li>"Public" – Accessible to everyone on the internet.</li>

                            the photos and information that others want to share with you. As well as providing
                            easy methods of discovering new Content, we also provide you with handy notifications
                            whenever your Contacts want to share something with you.</p>

                        <p>By visiting and using Pixie, you provide us with two types of information: personal
                            information you choose to disclose when signing up or administering your profile
                            and web site usage information collected by us as you use the Site.</p>
                        <p>By signing up with Pixie, you provide us with personal information, for instance
                            your name, email address, gender, date of birth, place of residence and any other
                            personal or preference information that your provide to us.</p>
                        <p>All visitors to Pixie will have their IP address, top-level domain used, the previous
                            website address from which you visited us (including any search terms used), data
                            which shows the traffic of visitors to the Site, browser type and browser capabilities
                            recorded. This information is collected by us in order to provide the service. In

                            more tiny text files on your computer. These cookies may persist beyond your usage
                            of the Site, but can be removed at any time without affecting your ability to use
                            your computer or the Site. You should note that technical details which we cannot

                        <p>Our service provides you with the facility to set up a personal profile, upload photos,
                            create groups, vote on Content, send messages, post comments, perform searches and
                            transmit information through various channels. In order to facilitate these features
                            and provide a more personalised experience, we need to collect and store information.
                            For example, you can visit the profile of one of your Contact, view and leave comments
                            on their photos. You may also discover other friends that are also using the service
                            and link these users to your own account.</p>
                        <p>In certain circumstances, when you update your information, we create a backup copy
                            of the previous version. This backup enables us to help you recover lost information
                            should the need arise.</p>
                        <p>By using pix.ie and submitting information to pix.ie, you do so at your own risk.
                            Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information,

                        <p>Pixie is an online community of users whose primary reason for using the service
                            is to share information (including their photos) with others. You can make informed
                            choices about who has access to your information by setting your own privacy options.
                            As part of the service you may be notified when new information is available to
                            view and to facilitate this, we may send you an email or other form of communication.
                            Should you not wish to receive communications from us, you may opt out by setting
                            the appropriate settings on your account. We do however reserve the right to send
                            you notifications about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary notifications.</p>
                        <p>Generally, we use the information gathered from our visitors in an aggregate form
                            to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and help us better
                            design and organise the Site. In addition, we may use the information you provide
                            to us in a variety of ways that enable us to better operate, maintain and provide
                            you with the features and functionality of Pixie.</p>
                        <p>We may also share information in your profile without identifying you as an individual
                            to third parties. For example, we may provide advertisers with hints as to what
                            might be the most appropriate advert for a certain category of user. This ultimately
                            provides you with a more personalised service without compromising your privacy.</p>

                        <p>We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where
                            we believe such sharing is (a) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (b) is
                            in our legitimate business interests, (c) legally required or (d) consented to by
                            you. For example: Our site contains RSS feeds that syndicate your information (including
                            photos and comments) to outside subscribers with appropriate access. Public feeds
                            contain only "Public" information while private feeds contain information appropriate
                            to the subscriber's account permissions.</p>
                        <p>We don't do everything in house! Therefore it may be necessary to provide our service
                            providers with information in order for us to be able to provide you with the service.
                            Where we utilise third parties in this regard, we implement contractual and technical
                            protections limiting the use of that information to that directly required for providing
                            our service to you and requiring compliance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and
                            2003.</p>
                        <p>In the event of merger with another company or acquisition by another company, you
                            will be notified before any information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

                        <p>We take the privacy of children very seriously. Accordingly, we do not knowingly
                            collect or maintain personal information from children on the Site. If we are informed

                            the consent of a parent or guardian, we will take reasonable steps to delete any
