In addition, we distribute that information to others to provide you with other products and services. This summary and the full policy below describes how information is collected and distributed and your choices with respect to your personal information. Please review the entire Privacy Policy for detailed information on our information and privacy practices.

We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them;

Details of transactions you carry out through our site or via other means (eg telephone orders) and of the fulfilment of your orders;

You can access the site home page and browse the site without disclosing personal information. We collect standard Internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns to help us identify things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of our site. We collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone (please see our Cookie Policy for more details);

Communication and usage data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.

### 3\. Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staffs operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In addition, if you place your personal information on publicly available parts of our site, this will be accessible to people in countries outside of the EEA. Such countries may not have data protection laws as comprehensive as those that exist within the EEA.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

* To allow you to participate in any interactive features of our services, if you choose to do so;
* To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer; and
* To notify you about changes to our service.

We may also use your data to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we may contact you about these by post or telephone.

If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. If you are not a customer we will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.
