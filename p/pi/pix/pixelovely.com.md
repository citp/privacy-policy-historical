# Privacy policies: Why you need one and how to write it - PIXELovely

## What is a Privacy Policy?

A Privacy Policy is an important document for your website that tells visitors exactly how your company collects their information and what your company does with it.

It’s technically a legal document, but it’s very important it’s drafted in such a way that your visitors can easily understand it. Obscuring hidden clauses in difficult to understand text is not an acceptable course of action.

## Why should you have a Privacy Policy?

When a visitor browses your website and makes a purchase from your webstore, your company needs to collect certain information from your visitor and store information on their computer (such as cookies that remember what’s in your visitor’s cart as well as their login session to their account).

Information you will be collecting usually includes, but is not limited to, their name, email address, shipping address and phone number.

This is sensitive information. Your company’s Privacy Policy will let a visitor know that you’re only collecting this information to fulfill the order they have placed with you and contact them in case any problems occur. Your company may also store this information into an account to make future purchases easier for the visitor.

It’s important to have a Privacy Policy to put your visitors at ease and cover yourself from any legal trouble regarding this information.

## What should a Privacy Policy cover?

Introduction:  
A section that tells your visitor about your company, including any special information or functions that your website has. Should your website have special conditions for collecting information from minors, it’s important to state them clearly in this section.

 **Information Collected:**  
Inform your visitors what information you are collecting from them. They have the right to know this, so don’t omit anything. It may be obvious that you are collecting personal details when they fill out a form, but it’s a good idea to repeat this here to avoid any issues or confusion. Don’t forget to include the information your server logs, such as hostnames and IP addresses.

 **Method of Collection:**  
This details the methods you use to collect the information. Are forms automated to collect other information, such as original referrer, or do they only collect the information a visitor puts into them? Do you place cookies in your visitors’ browsers that help collect the information? All of this information will help you build a detailed description of how you collect their information.

 **Storage of information:**  
How is the information stored? If the data is stored in a database, explain where the server is located. There are different protection laws for information storage per country and even per state, so it’s important to be clear with your visitors where their information ends up. Explain what legal permissions you have obtained and what obligations you have towards different organizations in the event of fraud. Visitors have the right to know that you will make every effort to store their personal information in a safe and secure environment.

 **Contact details:**  
It’s important that visitors have the ability to send in questions, as a Privacy Policy needs to be as transparent as possible. You should provide visitors with both an email address (or an online form), as well as a real world address where they can write to. Optionally you may list a phone number for direct contact.

## Example Privacy Policy

To make setting up a Privacy Policy easier, we’ve written this so called “boilerplate” policy for you to use as a template to create your own.

 **Please remember that this is very general and may not cover all the details of your website’s information handling. It’s highly advised to amend the policy to suit your specific needs. You may also want to run your policy by your web developer to make sure that you have indeed included all of the information your server collects. In all cases, you should have your privacy policy reviewed by a lawyer to make certain it is in compliance with the laws of your country, state, territory or other locale. We make no guarantees as to the legality of this sample document.**
