### Cookies of DoubleClick

What are cookies? 

  * Cookies are small text files that are stored in a user's browser. Most cookies contain a unique identifier called a cookie ID - a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser in which the cookie is stored. In this way, websites and servers can distinguish the browser from other browsers that store different cookies and recognize each browser by its unique cookie ID.
  * The use of cookies is widespread on websites and servers to offer many of the services we find online. If you buy from a website, a cookie allows the site to remember the items you have added to the shopping cart. If you set preferences on a website, a cookie allows the site to remember your preferences the next time you visit. Or if you register on a website, that site may use a cookie to recognize your browser later, so you do not have to re-register. Cookies also allow websites to collect data on user activity, such as how many unique visitors a page receives per month. All these applications depend on the information stored in cookies.



How does DoubleClick use cookies? 

  * DoubleClick uses cookies to improve advertising. They are often used to target ads based on content that is relevant to a user, improve campaign performance reporting, and avoid showing ads that the user has already seen.
  * 1 Each DoubleClick cookie ID is essential for these applications. For example, DoubleClick uses the cookie ID to keep track of the ads that are displayed in each browser. When you publish an ad in a browser, DoubleClick can use that browser's cookie ID to check DoubleClick ads that have already been served to it. This is how DoubleClick avoids publishing ads that the user has already seen. Similarly, cookie IDs allow DoubleClick to record conversions related to ad requests, such as when a user views a DoubleClick ad and then uses the same browser to visit the advertiser's website And make a purchase.
  * DoubleClick cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. With the user's permission, the information associated with the DoubleClick cookie can be added to your Google account.



How to disable this option 

  * You can disable it by [**Ad settings**](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences), The DoubleClick unique cookie ID of the user's browser will be overridden with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because a single cookie ID no longer exists, the disabled cookie can not be associated with a particular browser.
