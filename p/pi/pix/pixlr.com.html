<h2>Pixlr<sup>™</sup> privacy policy</h2>
<span>This privacy policy was last updated on 23 November 2011</span>
<p>
    </p><h3>Our Policy:</h3>
    Welcome to the web site (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) of Code Mine in Stockholm AB 
    (“<strong>Pixlr</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” and/or “<strong>our</strong>”).  
    This Site is operated by Pixlr and has been created to provide information about our company and 
    to provide photo-related services (including photo editing and photo sharing services) 
    and other services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”) to our 
    Site visitors (“<strong>you</strong>” and/or “<strong>your</strong>”). 
    This Privacy Policy sets forth Pixlr’s policy with respect to information including 
    personally identifiable data (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”) and other information that 
    is collected from Site visitors. 
<p></p>
<p>
    </p><h3>Information We Collect:</h3>
    When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, 
    as further described below:    
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>
            <strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong>
            We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, 
            such as when you register for access to the Services, use certain Services, 
            contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Pixlr collects 
            Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Provided When Using Our Services Involving Other Sites:</strong>
            We have business relationships with other websites, where those sites make our Services available,
            for example through a link or frame that will transfer you to our Site. Some information may be shared
            automatically in order to make the connection, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address.  In other cases,
            you may be prompted to provide registration information.  We request our partners to provide a link to or the URL (web address) of this Privacy Policy in these cases.
            <p>
                <strong>
                    By providing us with Personal Data as described above, you are consenting to our use 
                    of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data and other data may be transferred from your current 
                    location to the offices and servers of Pixlr and the authorized third parties referred 
                    to herein located in the United States or elsewhere.
                </strong>
            </p>
        </li>         
        <li>
            <strong>Other Information:</strong>
            <br><br>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>
                    <strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong>
                    When you interact with Pixlr through the Site, we receive and store certain personally 
                    non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using 
                    various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. 
                    Pixlr may store such information itself or such information may be included in 
                    databases owned and maintained by Pixlr affiliates, agents or service providers. 
                    This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, 
                    for example, usage data for the Services, the types of filters and applications 
                    used by users of the Services, the number of images that are open on our Site, 
                    the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of 
                    our Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. 
                    It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
                    <p>
                        In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." 
                        A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives 
                        to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional 
                        functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. 
                        For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to 
                        access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

                    <strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong>
                    In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, 
                    Pixlr often conducts research on its customer demographics, 
                    interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. 
                    This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, 
                    and Pixlr may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business 
                    partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. 
                    Pixlr may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our 
                    services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

<p>
    </p><h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>
    Pixlr uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 
    If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, 
    we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. 
    For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide 
    to answer your question or resolve your problem. 
    Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, 
    we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and 
    to monitor your use of such services. Pixlr, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates 
    (the “<strong>Pixlr Related Companies</strong>”) may also use your Personal Data and 
    other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help 
    us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand 
    our users and to improve the Services. 
    Pixlr and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell 
    you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, 
    each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" 
    of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to 
    receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, 
    please contact us as indicated below.
    <p>
        If Pixlr intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, 
        you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
    </p>
<p></p>
<p>
    </p><h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>
    Pixlr is not in the business of selling your information. 
    We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. 
    There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with 
    certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
                As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. 
                In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, 
                Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

                <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong>
                Pixlr, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain 
                business-related functions. Examples of such functions include data hosting, 
                mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. 
                When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, 
                we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

        </li>

                Certain Services enable you to access and save images to social media platforms and/or other websites.
