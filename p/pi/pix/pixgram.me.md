## Pixgram ("Pixgram") operates several websites including Pixgram.me. It is Pixgram's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Pixgram collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pixgram's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pixgram's visitors use its website. From time to time, Pixgram may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

## Instagram Content

All photographic and video content on Pixgram.me comes from Instagram and was publicly available at the time of its appearing on our site. The content is owned by those who posted it and carries the copyright attributed by that owner. You can control your content's visibility by changing your Instagram settings to prevent your content from appearing on third-party sites like Pixgram.me. Visit Instagram's help center to learn more about [controlling your visibility](https://help.instagram.com/116024195217477/).
