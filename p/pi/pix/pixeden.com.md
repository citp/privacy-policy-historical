BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE.

**1\. Changes to Privacy Statement**

We may change this Privacy Statement at any time by posting the revised Privacy Statement in the “Privacy Statement” section of the Website. The revised Privacy Statement is effective immediately when posted on the Website.

**2\. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information**

We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

**Personally Identifiable Information**. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, subscribing to our newsletters, posting a comment, submitting content and/or posting comment in our community forum, filling out our contact or hire us form (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address…. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, our product offerings, and to tailor your experience to the best. For example, if you send an email or post a comment we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies.

We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

**3\. Release of Personally Identifiable Information**

We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:

We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Statement, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.

**4\. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

We use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.

**5\. Updating and Correcting Information**

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.

As a condition of creating an account or subscribing to our newsletter, we will send you Administrative and Newsletters emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity as well as updates about our resources. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries.

In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel have access to.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.

For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, (Paypal), keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf.
