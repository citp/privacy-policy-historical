PIXORIAL CONSUMER PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT

Updated September 9, 2008 

Pixorial is dedicated to protecting your privacy online.  

This policy statement describes the ways we collect, store, use, and protect your personal information. By using our service, you consent to the collection and use of information in the manner described below. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.  

Information We Collect Automatically 

When you visit the Pixorial website, we automatically collect non-personal information including your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and operating system, the date and time you access the website, where you linked from, and the pages you visit. We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors. For example, the information helps us determine the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use.  

While you are browsing, we do not collect any personal information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, unless you provide it to us voluntarily, for example, by sending us an e-mail message or requesting to be placed on our e-mail list.  

Information We Collect From Subscribers 

When you open an account with us, we will ask you for the following personal information: 

  * Your name 

  * Your phone number 

  * Your e-mail address 

  * Your billing and mailing addresses 

  * Your credit card information 




When you share your movies with others, we will ask you for their names and e-mail addresses.  

You can choose not to provide this information, but then you may not be able to use all of our services.  

We also collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, and we store your digital content, associated labels and editing meta-data. In addition, if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.  

Information We Do Not Collect 

Pixorial does not knowingly collect or maintain any personal information from children under the age of 13. No part of our site is intended or designed for the purpose of attracting any person under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, do not use our site.  

Information We Temporarily Place on Your Computer's Hard Drive 

A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Pixorial uses temporary cookies in limited ways. When you log into your account, for example, we send a "session cookie" to your computer. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so we do not need to keep asking you for your password. Once you log out or close your browser, the temporary cookies used by Pixorial expire, with the exception of a "remember me" cookie. Pixorial cookies do not generate personal data, do not read personal data from your computer, and are not linked to any information that could be used to identify you.  

You can always choose not to accept Pixorial's temporary cookies. Your browser instructions contain the information you need to modify your choices about cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, however, you may be unable to use all of Pixorial's services.  

How We Protect Your Information 

Pixorial takes commercially reasonable steps to protect the privacy and security of your personally identifiable information.  

  * Pixorial keeps the personal information you provide on servers that are located in physically secure facilities and protected by firewalls and other technological means.  

  * Your address and credit card number are encrypted once they are transmitted to us and stored in encrypted form.  

  * Our employees are trained to support these security measures and only have access to your information on a need-to-know basis.  




In addition, your customer account is password-protected. You can and should significantly increase the security of your personal information by changing your password three or four times a year and keeping it confidential.  

While we strive to protect your information, we of course cannot ensure or guarantee that these security measures will prevent Pixorial's databases from being illegally accessed and the information on them stolen or altered.  

How We Use Your Information 

Pixorial uses your personal information to conduct business with you. Some examples include: 

  * Creating and maintaining your account, 

  * Processing and fulfilling your orders, 

  * Answering your e-mail messages, 

  * Performing other administrative tasks,

  * Sharing your movies with your friends and family at your direction, and 

  * Improving the quality and design of our website, providing you with great service, and meeting your customer needs. 




When We May Share Information  

Pixorial shares personal information with third parties under the following circumstances: 

  * We may share the information with companies who assist us with our business operations. Our contracts require that these service providers use your information only in connection with the business support functions they perform for us. They do not store, retain, access or otherwise use your personal information other than as necessary to provide you with Pixorial services. Some examples of these business support functions include shipping and payment processing.  



  * We may share your information at your direction or with your consent, when you request that we e-mail a movie to your friends and family, for example.

    * We believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential harm to the rights, property or safety of any person, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Use. 



  * We may transfer or assign the information to another company or organization as part of a merger or acquisition, the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets or other change of control of our company.
