3.     WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHY

Cookies. When you visit our Pokki Sites, we will send you a cookie, which is a small file stored on your computer that allows us to uniquely identify it. Where required by applicable law, we obtain your consent for the use of cookies.  You may choose to delete or not accept our cookies as described under “Your Rights and Choices” below.  If you delete or choose not to accept our cookies, you may not be able to utilize all the features of our products and services.  

Logs. When you install Pokki Software, or when you visit our Pokki Sites, we capture and store the data that your computer or web browser sends us. This data may include your operating system (OS) type, browser type, language, Internet Protocol (IP) address, the date and time of your request and the cookie ID (when you visit our Pokki Sites) or unique ID (when you install Pokki Software) that helps identify your computer. We may also determine your geographical information through your IP address to better understand the interaction of your location with your use of our Pokki Software and Pokki Sites.  However, we do not store or associate your IP address with any data we collect from you, and we only collect and store geographical information we have derived in aggregate form.    

Usage Information. Generally, our Pokki Software automatically collects usage information with respect to particular Pokki Apps, or with respect to the Pokki Menu, such as the frequency with which a Pokki App or the Pokki Menu has been clicked or opened, and how long a Pokki App or Pokki Menu remains open. We also collect installation information, which may include information on whether a Pokki App or the Pokki Menu has been installed or uninstalled, and how long the Pokki Software has been installed on your system.  

With respect to visitors to the Pokki Sites, we collect usage information such as the number and frequency of visitors, what pages have been visited, average time spent on pages, and other information which helps us determine which features on our Pokki Sites are most important to you and working effectively.  

We only use the usage information we collect in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure to allow us to improve the Pokki platform.  We do not use such usage information to identify you, nor do we associate any usage information we collect with any information that may personally identify you, such as a name or address.    

  
Third Party Analytic Tools.  The Pokki Site, the Pokki Menu, and the Pokki Apps that we have developed, may use third party analytic tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information gathering technologies to collect standard internet log information and usage information.  The information generated is used to compile statistical reports on user activity.  We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical reports to track or to collect any personal information of visitors to the Pokki Sites or users of Pokki software. We will not associate any information gathered from the statistical reports with any personal information from any source.    

User Accounts.  If you have created a user account, we collect and maintain all information that you provide to us in connection with your creation of a Pokki user account, including personal information such as your name, email address, date of birth and photo (if you have chosen to upload a photo to your user account profile). The personal information you provide in connection with your account is used in order to help us manage your account and provide services and features in connection with your account.  We never associate any personal information you provide in connection with your account with any other information we may collect through the Pokki Sites or the Pokki Software.  

Third Party Pokki Apps and Sites.  If you have installed a Pokki App provided by a third party, or a Pokki App that accesses third party sites or services, then that third party may also collect information regarding your usage of such Pokki App, or your access or usage of the third party sites or services accessed by such Pokki App.  Any information collected by a third party provider of a Pokki App, or a site or service accessed by a Pokki App, is governed by such third party providers’ privacy policies.  These third party sites or applications may also place their own cookies or other files on your computer, or may collect data or solicit personal information from you.  We do not exercise control over any third party sites that a Pokki App or other third party application, may link to.

Software Developer Accounts. If you are a software developer or publisher that uses the Pokki.com site to publish or distribute your Pokki App, we collect and maintain all information that you provide to us in connection with the Pokki App submission, review and approval process in order to help us manage your account and communicate with you regarding our review of a submitted Pokki App.

Communications; Other Information You Provide.  Any time you send us a communication, whether as a posting to our support pages, through email inquiries, or via postings or communications on social media sites or networks such as Facebook or Twitter, we may keep such communications so that we can respond to your requests or inquiries and help improve our services to you.  Posts to our Support pages located within support.pokki.com will display your user name as you have indicated it in your profile. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as improving the content of our sites, customizing and improving our services, and communicating with you about our services.  We may use personal information you provide to communicate with you about specials and new features.  We will obtain your consent where required by applicable law.  You can opt out from receiving promotional communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions described in the email.
