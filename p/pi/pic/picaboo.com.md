# Privacy Policy | Picaboo

Picaboo Corporation (“Picaboo”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. To learn more about how Picaboo uses your personal information, please read the following Privacy Policy. By submitting information to us or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

#### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Picaboo’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Picaboo gathers when you are accessing Picaboo’s web pages and when you use Picaboo software or services (collectively, “Services”). This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Picaboo does not own or control, or to individuals that Picaboo does not employ or manage.

#### What Personal Information Does Picaboo Collect?

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize our service, fulfill your request for services, limit the use of services, customize content you see, conduct research, provide anonymous reporting for internal and external partners and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.

#### Personal Information You Provide to Us:

We may receive and store any information you enter through the use of the Services, in connection with your registration to use our software or provide to us in any other way. When you register as a Picaboo user, we ask for Personal Information, including, but not limited to your email address and name. Such Personal Information is required for us to perform functions associated with the Services such as sending and receiving Content and comments to and from your Pals (as described below) and notifying users of account status. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some our features.

From time to time, Picaboo may also seek Personal Information via voluntary “opt-in” surveys or contests. Personal Information requested may include contact information (mailing address and phone number) and demographic information (such as zip code or age level).

The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as informing members of service improvements, scheduled maintenance, feature announcements, newsletters, promotional offers, responding to your requests for certain products and services, measuring the effectiveness of our offerings, customizing content you see and communicating with you about specials and new products.

#### Picaboo Content, Recipients, Sharing & Forwarding:

When you use the Picaboo client software, all of your books, cards and related content (“Content”) are viewable only by you unless you explicitly share them with others. You, your Recipients and their Recipients can see your Content only when you share them via the Picaboo Network. A Recipient is defined as a Picaboo member with whom you share your Content. When you choose to share your Content with Recipients, those Recipients will be able to view your Content online via a link in a browser, or via their Picaboo software if they have installed it.

Once you share Content, your Recipients can forward that Content at will. Moreover, your Recipients and their recipients will be able to print and order bound versions of the Content you share with them.

Finally, Recipients may save your Content as their own Content for collaboration of other purposes and may save pictures out of your Content on their computers for their own use. You acknowledge that Recipients could share content that you have restricted through book, card or other product “rules” by capturing screen shots of such content or taking photos of such content on their screens to share with others.

Picaboo makes no assurances or warranties that your books, cards or other products and content are fully protected.

Your Content and related content may be seen by Picaboo employees or law enforcement agencies only to the extent (i) necessary to evaluate, validate, or correct problems with your account, (ii) the law or legal process requires it, or (iii) it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of Picaboo or others.

#### Picaboo Pal Invitations:

A Picaboo Pal Invitee, or Recipient, is someone that you invite to view your Content. To send an invitation you must provide Picaboo with an email address for the Picaboo Pal Invitee. Picaboo will not add Picaboo Pal Invitees to a mailing list or send further emails (except to deliver invitations from other Picaboo users), unless they become Picaboo users themselves, in which case they will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Picaboo will not sell, rent or distribute Picaboo Pal Invitee email addresses to third parties. Picaboo may use aggregate non-personal information about Invitees for statistical analysis.

#### Personal Information Collected Automatically:

We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Services. Picaboo may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or through the use of the Services including your User ID, IP address, cookie information, the webpage you requested, time of Service access, date of access, Service usage patterns, Content shared and received, file size of Content and Service features used. Picaboo collects this data to provide users with a more satisfactory experience, to limit the use of Services pursuant to our Terms of Use, and to monitor system status and customer abuse of the Picaboo Service. Picaboo will not share such information with any other person or entity in a manner that identifies you as an individual, unless we have your permission. Picaboo does not regularly monitor or collect information on individual pictures or other content within books, cards or other products other than that which has been described in this Policy.

Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Picaboo only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the website or services so that we can make the website and services appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.

Our Service automatically gathers certain information related to the usage and effectiveness of our online self-service support and personal support. We only use such data to help us determine how effective support service is, so we can improve our service and support tools and make them as effective as possible.

#### E-mail Communications:

Once you complete and submit your registration, you will begin receiving email communication from us. We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Picaboo if your computer supports this type of program. Picaboo may use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at support@picaboo.com and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.

#### What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Picaboo may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy

_Protection of Picaboo and Others:_ We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Picaboo, our employees, our customers, or others.
