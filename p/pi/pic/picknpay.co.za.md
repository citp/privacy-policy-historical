**Type Of Information The Website Collects**

The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter any competition, complete a survey, make a purchase or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age and gender may also be requested.

Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the Website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol address.

**How The Information Is Used**

The personally identifying information you supply through the Website is used to provide you with the service you have requested, to respond to your inquiries or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. For example, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated companies.

We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us with marketing or promotional assistance, analyse our data, assist us with customer service, etc. Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your information with participating sponsors to a programme or competition you enter via our Website, our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Other than as provided in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information to the Website, we will not share or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent.

A cookie is a piece of information that is deposited on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser when you use our computer server. The cookies enable us to recognise you and give us information about your previous visits. We learn which advertisements bring users to our Website. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter your settings to prevent automatic acceptance.

The information that we collect and may share with our advertisers is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address.

**Mobile Device Identifiers**

Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information if you access the Website through mobile devices. Certain features of our Website may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this information.

An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

From time to time, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with the information we collect through the Website. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal identifiable information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personally identifiable information.
