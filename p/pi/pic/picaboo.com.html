            <br>
    </span></div>
      <div align="left"><span id="Ggeo4653">Picaboo Corporation ("Picaboo") knows that you care about how   your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy   seriously. &nbsp;To learn more how Picaboo uses your personal information, please   read the following Privacy Policy. By submitting information to us or using any   of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies   outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
            <br>
        WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY   COVER?<br>
        This Privacy Policy covers Picaboo?s treatment of personally   identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Picaboo gathers when you   are accessing Picaboo's web pages and when you use Picaboo software or services   (collectively, "Services"). This policy does not apply to the practices of   companies that Picaboo does not own or control, or to individuals that Picaboo   does not employ or manage.<br>
        <br>
        WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY   COLLECT?<br>
        The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize   our service, fulfill your request for services, limit the use of services,   customize content you see, conduct research, provide anonymous reporting for   internal and external partners and improve our services. &nbsp;We collect the   following types of information from our customers.<br>
        Personal Information You   Provide to Us:<br>
        <br>
        We may receive and store any information you enter through   the use of the Services, in connection with your registration to use our   software or provide to us in any other way. &nbsp;When you register as a Picaboo   user, we ask for Personal Information, including, but not limited to your email   address and name. &nbsp;Such Personal Information is required for us to perform   functions associated with the Services such as sending and receiving albums and   comments to and from your Pals (as described below) and notifying users of   account status. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but   then you may not be able to take advantage of some our features. &nbsp;<br>
        From time   to time, Picaboo may also seek Personal Information via voluntary "opt-in"   surveys or contests. &nbsp;Personal Information requested may include contact   information (mailing address and phone number) and demographic information (such   as zip code or age level). &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The Personal Information you provide may be   used for such purposes as informing members of service improvements, scheduled   maintenance, feature announcements, newsletters, promotional offers, responding   to your requests for certain products and services, measuring the effectiveness   of our offerings, customizing content you see and communicating with you about   specials and new products. &nbsp;<br>
        When you make a purchase through Picaboo, we do   not store your credit card information. &nbsp;There is more information about your   credit card information below.<br>
        <br>
        Picaboo Albums, Recipients, Sharing &amp;   Forwarding:<br>
        <br>
        When you use the Picaboo client software, all of your albums   and related content are viewable only by you unless you explicitly share them   with others. &nbsp;You, your Recipients and their Recipients can see your albums only   when you share them via the Picaboo Network. A Recipient is defined as a Picaboo   member with whom you share an album. &nbsp;When you choose to share your albums with   Recipients, those Recipients will be able to view your album online via a link   in a browser, or via their Picaboo software if they have installed it. <br>
        <br>
        Once you share an album, your Recipients can forward that album at will.   &nbsp;Moreover, your Recipients and their recipients will be able to print, create   DVDs and order bound versions of the albums you share with them.   &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Finally, Recipients may save your albums as their own albums for   collaboration of other purposes and may save pictures out of your album on their   computers for their own use. &nbsp;You acknowledge that Recipients could share   content that you have restricted through Album Rules by capturing screen shots   of such content or taking photos of such content on their screens to share with   others. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Picaboo makes no assurances or warranties that your albums and   content are fully protected. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Your albums and related content may be   seen by Picaboo employees or law enforcement agencies only to the extent (i)   necessary to evaluate, validate, or correct problems with your account, (ii) the   law or legal process requires it, or (iii) it is necessary to do so to protect   the rights or property of Picaboo or others.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Picaboo Pal   Invitations:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        A Picaboo Pal Invitee, or Recipient, is someone that   you invite to view your album(s). To send an invitation you must provide Picaboo   with an email address for the Picaboo Pal Invitee. &nbsp;Picaboo will not add Picaboo   Pal Invitees to a mailing list or send further emails (except to deliver   invitations from other Picaboo users), unless they become Picaboo users   themselves, in which case they will be subject to the terms of this Privacy   Policy. &nbsp; Picaboo will not sell, rent or distribute Picaboo Pal Invitee email   addresses to third parties. &nbsp;Picaboo may use aggregate non-personal information   about Invitees for statistical analysis.<br>
        <br>
        Personal Information Collected   Automatically: </span>
          <ul>
            <li><span id="Ggeo4653">We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact   with our Services. &nbsp;Picaboo may choose to automatically receive and record   information on our server logs from your browser or through the use of the   Services including your User ID, IP address, cookie information, the webpage you   requested, time of Service access, date of access, Service usage patterns,   number of albums shared and received, file size of albums and Service features   used. Picaboo collects this data to provide users with a more satisfactory   experience, to limit the use of Services pursuant to our Terms of Use, and to   monitor system status and customer abuse of the Picaboo Service. &nbsp;Picaboo will   not share such information with any other person or entity in a manner that   identifies you as an individual, unless we have your permission. Picaboo does   not regularly monitor or collect information on individual pictures or other   content within albums other than that which has been described in this Policy. &nbsp; </span></li>
            <li><span id="Ggeo4653">Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as   the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to   TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. &nbsp;Picaboo   only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and   not in a manner that would identify you personally. &nbsp;This type of aggregate data   enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the website or   services so that we can make the website and services appealing to as many   customers as possible, and improve those services. &nbsp;As part of this use of   information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our   customers, collectively, use our site. &nbsp; We share this type of statistical data   so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our   website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. </span></li>
            <li><span id="Ggeo4653">Our Service automatically gathers certain information related to the usage   and effectiveness of our online self-service support and personal support. We   only use such data to help us determine how effective support service is, so we   can improve our service and support tools and make them as effective as   possible. </span></li>
          </ul>
        <span id="Ggeo4653">E-mail Communications:<br>
          <br>
          We may receive a confirmation   when you open an e-mail from Picaboo if your computer supports this type of   program. Picaboo may use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more   interesting and helpful. &nbsp;We may also compare our customer list to lists   received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary   messages to our customers. &nbsp;If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail   from us, please notify us by e-mail at support@picaboo.com and include   sufficient information for us to identify your account.<br>
          <br>
          What About   Cookies? </span>
        <ul>
            <li><span id="Ggeo4653">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer?s   hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser   and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. &nbsp; </span></li>
          <li><span id="Ggeo4653">Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will   prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the   sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of   each new cookie in a variety of ways.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <span id="Ggeo4653">WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE   PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?<br>
          The protection of our users? Personal   Information is very important to us. &nbsp;We neither rent nor sell your Personal   Information to anyone. &nbsp;We share your Personal Information only with your   consent or to business partners and affiliates as described below. <br>
          Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We are affiliated with a variety of   businesses and work closely with them. &nbsp;In certain situations, these businesses   may operate services at the Picaboo website or sell services or products to you   through Picaboo?s website. &nbsp;In other situations, Picaboo provides services, or   sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. &nbsp;You may generally be able to   recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and   we may share customer information that is related to such transactions with that   affiliated business. &nbsp;For the most part, affiliated businesses are not permitted   to market to you directly. &nbsp;They will do so in conjunction with Picaboo, if at   all.<br>
          <br>
          Agents: We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on   our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or   services to you. &nbsp;Unless we tell you differently, Picaboo?s agents do not have   any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is   necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal   Information for the above purposes.<br>
          <br>
          Business Transfers: In some cases, we   may choose to buy or sell assets. &nbsp;In these types of transactions, customer   information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.   &nbsp;Moreover, if Picaboo, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired,   customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired   by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any   acquirer of Picaboo may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth   in this policy.<br>
          <br>
          Protection of Picaboo and Others: We may release Personal   Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply   with any law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or   protect the rights, property, or safety of Picaboo, our employees, our   customers, or others. &nbsp;This includes exchanging information with other companies   and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
          <br>
          With   Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal   Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the   sharing of this information.<br>
          <br>
          IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME   SECURE?<br>
          Your Picaboo account Personal Information is protected by a   password-protected database residing within our secure network behind active   firewall software for your privacy and security. &nbsp;Although we will exercise   reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between our   servers and your computer, we cannot absolutely ensure or warrant the security   of any information transmitted to us over the Internet. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          You need to   ensure against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by   selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your   computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your   account, for example. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Picaboo uses third party e-commerce providers to   manage and fulfill transactions related to the Service such as billing and   payment processing. &nbsp;Any information collected by Picaboo?s third party   e-commerce providers is retained on secure pages that are encrypted using the   SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. &nbsp;These third party providers will collect   such information at the time of the transaction. &nbsp;Picaboo does not store your   credit card or other financial information.<br>
          <br>
          WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN   I ACCESS?<br>
          Picaboo may allow you to access certain information about yourself   for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that   information. &nbsp;Such information can be changed and accessed on the Picaboo   website under "Customer Support". The types of information that you can access   and update will change as our Service changes.<br>
          <br>
          PROTECTION OF   CHILDREN.<br>
          The Picaboo Service is not intended for or directed to persons   under the age of 13. &nbsp;Any person who provides his or her information to Picaboo   through any part of the Services represents that he or she is 13 years of age or   older.<br>
          <br>
          WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE? </span>
        <ul>
            <li><span id="Ggeo4653">As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information to   Picaboo, even though it may be needed to receive services or take advantage of   certain Picaboo services. </span></li>
          <li><span id="Ggeo4653">You may be able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those   that may be listed in the "What Personal Information Can I Access" section   above. &nbsp;When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the   unrevised information in our records. </span></li>
          <li><span id="Ggeo4653">You may request deletion of your Picaboo account by sending an e-mail to   &nbsp;support@picaboo.com and responding affirmatively to any confirmation e-mails   that we may send. &nbsp;Please note that some information may remain in our records   after deletion of your account. </span></li>
          <li><span id="Ggeo4653">If you do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us   by e-mail at support@picaboo.com, and provide sufficient information for us to   identify your account. &nbsp;Please note that if you do not want to receive legal   notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still   govern your use of the Picaboo website, and you are responsible for reviewing   such legal notices for changes. </span></li>
          <li><span id="Ggeo4653">As explained earlier, the majority of browsers allow you to monitor and   restrict our use of cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not   accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of some of our services or   website features.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <span id="Ggeo4653">EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY<br>
          This Privacy   Policy is effective as of August 27th, 2004.<br>
