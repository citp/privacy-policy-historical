# Privacy Policy - PicsArt

Last Updated October 16, 2015 

This Privacy Policy describes how PicsArt, Inc. ( **"PicsArt"** , **"picsart"** , **"We"** , **"Us"** , or **"Our"** ) protects your privacy when you use PicsArt (the **"PicsArt Service"** ) which includes the Web site located at www.picsart.com (the **"Site"** ) and all PicsArt mobile phone applications except for our Kids apps ( **"Mobile"** ). The privacy policy that applies to our Kids app can be found [here.](https://web.archive.org/kids/privacy-policy)

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, YOU MAY NOT USE THE PICSART SERVICE. 

This Privacy Policy applies to information (including personal information) collected through the PicsArt Service. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Personal information does not include technical, device, or usage information that cannot be used to identify you personally, nor does it include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the PicsArt Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information have been removed. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate and non-personal information, and we may share such data about our users with third parties for various purposes. This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into PicsArt's [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions) ( **"Terms of Service"** ). 

##  The What & How of Information We Collect 

We collect certain personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide us when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services. We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with information we collect on the PicsArt Service; for example, when you link your account with Facebook, we might have access to your name. 

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect some information. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit, including ours. Such information includes your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on the Site. 

With your permission (on download or in the app), we may access and store your device's contact list to find your friends on the PicsArt Service, to invite them, or to share your Content with them. We may also collect information about others if you use the PicsArt Service to upload, share and/or distribute Content that contains information about them, including their name, image and online contact information. 

_Cookies_ \- We automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Site and your experience on the Site. We use cookies to see which areas and features of the Site are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Site, to personalize your experience and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Site. 

_Content and Metadata_ \- Images may be accompanied by additional Content such as a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords), comments, or may include metadata like a geotag. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using others' APIs then your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and may be searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings. 

##  Storage of Information & Transfer of Data 

Most of the information we collect is retained by us on our servers. If you are using the PicsArt Service from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently the United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. 

##  How We Use Your Personal Information 

We use personal information collected through the PicsArt Service: 

  1. to communicate with you or third parties; 
  2. to process your requests and transactions; 
  3. to improve the PicsArt Service; 
  4. to customize the services and/or products we provide to you; 
  5. to assist with our product and service development; 
  6. to perform marketing activities; 
  7. to provide relevant advertising; and 
  8. for other purposes related to our business. 



##  With Whom We Share Your Personal Information 

Personal information (and non-personal information) collected through the PicsArt Service may be shared with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf (for example, companies that provide data management or other support services to us such as data storage and Web hosting services). We may share your personal information (and non-personal information) with third parties to serve you relevant advertising and market our products, but we won't sell your personal information. 

Also, we may disclose the personal information we collect through the PicsArt Service when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to: 

  1. comply with applicable law (e.g., in response to a valid court order or subpoena); 
  2. prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; 
  3. enforce the Terms of PicsArt Service or other agreements that govern your use of the PicsArt Service and/or our services; 
  4. to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others; or 
  5. to protect your vital interests. 



If we are going to release your information in response to legal process, our policy is to provide you with reasonable advance notice under the circumstances unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)). We may disclose your information without giving you prior notice if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this privacy policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to efforts by third parties to compel disclosure of your information, including legal orders from the government. 

Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy. 

##  Modifying Your Information - Opt-Out / Opt-In 

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. You may update or modify your information or change your privacy preferences at any time by emailing us at [privacy@picsart.com](mailto:privacy@picsart.com) or, in some instances, via the PicsArt Service. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, including, but not limited to, promotional emails, by emailing us at [privacy@picsart.com.](mailto:privacy@picsart.com) Transactional service communications (such as messages about your registration) are not subject to the foregoing opt-out procedures. Requests to disable your account or reset your password should be sent to [support@picsart.com](mailto:support@picsart.com) for faster processing. 

##  SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information (including preventing the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of your personal information). However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures. If you use a password on the PicsArt Service, you are responsible for keeping it confidential. Do not share it with any other person. If you believe your password has been misused or your account compromised, please advise us immediately.
