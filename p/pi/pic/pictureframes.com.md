In order to make improvements in the way we communicate and interact with customers, pictureframes.com may also compile aggregate data from all of our customers to prepare internal reports.

In some instances, we use third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you, to assist us in managing customer information, to fulfill promotions and to communicate with you.

In addition, we may allow third party service providers such as advertisers, website statistics gatherers and others to use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, serve advertisements, collect statistics about use of the Site and enable such third parties to record information such as your browser type, IP address, which ads your browser has seen, which Site pages you may have been viewing when ads were delivered, your referring URL, your geographic location and other interaction information (but not your name or address).

The information is not provided to these agencies or companies for marketing purposes.

The information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with other marketers to bring you offers of interest.

We reserve the right to share this personally identifiable information with third party sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles, games and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game or promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game and promotion in which you participate through the website, as they may contain additional important information about pictureframes.com's or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information.
