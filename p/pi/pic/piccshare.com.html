			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Is My Information Private With PiccShare Advertisers?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Each of our third-party advertiser web sites may have a Privacy Policy that differs from that of PiccShare. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of third-party advertisers. </li>
				<li>When you use the PiccShare Software Application, you will see advertisements that are periodically updated. These advertisement messages typically come from third-party advertisement servers or advertisement networks. </li>
				<li>Some of these advertising networks may place a persistent <i>cookie</i> on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement message. A <i>cookie</i> is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by an online server. <i>Cookies</i> contain information that can later be read by an online server in the domain that issued the <i>cookie</i> to you. </li>
				<li><i>Cookies</i> cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. You have the ability to accept or decline <i>cookies</i>. Most web browsers automatically accept <i>cookies</i>, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline <i>cookies</i> if you prefer. Note that the PiccShare Software Application does not use <i>cookies</i>, and does not have access to the <i>cookies</i> that may be placed by the third-party advertising servers or networks. </li>
				<li>Advertising messages displayed in the PiccShare Software Application may contain electronic images known as <i>Web Beacons </i> - sometimes called 'single-pixel gifs' - in order to help compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. We prohibit <i>Web Beacons </i> in advertisements displayed in the PiccShare Software Application from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.</li>
				<li>Finally, PiccShare may work with other companies that advertise in the PiccShare Software Application, in order to place <i>Web Beacons </i> on their web sites, in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement in our application results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's web site. In these ways, PiccShare and the advertising networks may compile information about what advertisements are seen in the PiccShare Software Application and determine which advertisements Users click. In addition, advertising messages may be stored on your computer for display while you are offline. </li>
				<li>PiccShare may compile information about what advertising messages are seen in the PiccShare Software Application, and determine which advertising messages are clicked on, and may share that information with advertising networks. This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. PiccShare may use demographic information collected from you during the registration process (including age, location and gender data) to target advertisements that we believe will be of most interest to you.</li>
				<li>When you click on an advertisement, you will be taken to a web site managed by third parties. By activating these links, you are no longer using the PiccShare Software Application. Neither PiccShare, nor the PiccShare Software Application, has control over the third-party web sites. These web sites are owned and operated by third parties. Therefore, PiccShare cannot warrant or guarantee the quality or content thereof, nor the quality of products offered or the security of performing transactions on those web sites.

If you choose to provide additional Personal Information, Users will see such additional Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your photos, location, website and/or biography. Providing additional Personal Information is voluntary and should be based upon how much you want Users to know about you. CAVEAT: If you are concerned about confidentiality and do not want others to see your content or information, we suggest that you not post or share anything online or through PiccShare.</li>
