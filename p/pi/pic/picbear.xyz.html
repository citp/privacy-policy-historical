The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p> <p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p> <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p> <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p> <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p> <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p> <ul> <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li> </ul> <p>Can change your personal information:</p> <ul> <li>By logging in to your account</li> </ul> <p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p> <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p> <p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p> <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p> <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p> <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p> <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p> <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p> <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p> <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p> <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification in 30 days.</p> <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p> <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p> <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p> <p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p> <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p> <ul> <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li> <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li> <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li> <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li> <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li> <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li> </ul> <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p> </div> </div> </div>  <div class="modal fade" id="modal-media-detail" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel"> <div class="dynamic-ad"></div> <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg" role="document"> <div class="modal-nav text-center"> <a class="media-detail modal-nav-prev" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a> <a data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close" href="#"><i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i></a> <a class="media-detail modal-nav-next" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a> </div> <div class="modal-content"></div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 text-center"> <p>© 2018 Picbear - Online Instagram Web Viewer</p> <p>This service uses the Instagram API but is not endorsed or certified by Instagram.</p> <p class="footer-social-networks"> <a rel="nofollow" class="oval footer-facebook external" href="https://www.facebook.com/picbearcom" title="Follow picbear on facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="oval footer-twitter external" href="https://twitter.com/picbear_com" title="Follow picbear on twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="oval footer-instagram external" href="https://www.instagram.com/picbear_com/" title="Follow picbear on instagram"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="oval footer-gplus external" href="https://plus.google.com/117932253854618849684" title="Follow picbear on Google Plus"><i class="fa fa-google"></i></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="oval footer-pinterest external" href="https://www.pinterest.com/picbear/" title="Follow picbear on Pinterest"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <span class="scrollup"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></span> <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> <script src="http://picbear-xyz-djyr9806kcqmo7.stackpathdns.com/js/custom.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-5777df3e6d0c4679"></script>   </body></html>
