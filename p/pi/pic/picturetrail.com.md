We periodically conduct optional surveys on our website and via email asking for your preferences in site usage and about the type of promotional material and products you may be interested in. We use data from our surveys to send information to our users about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. We also run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like name, email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about the results of these contests and about our company.
