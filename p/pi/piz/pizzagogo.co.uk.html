<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Pizza GoGo Limited cares about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for 
	us to provide to you our website platform (the "Website"), mobile application (the "App"), and business services including the sale of products (collectively, our "Services").
	The Services are operated by Pizza GoGo Limited ("Pizza GoGo", the "Company", "we" or "us") for customers of the Services ("You").
</p>
<p>
	If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer ("DPO") 
	and our dedicated team by contacting us at data@pizzagogo.net.

<br><br><br>



<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>
	We collect personal data whenever you place an order with us via our website, on-line, phone and
	collection orders. We need this data to be able to fulfil your order, for example, your address and
	phone number when we need to deliver your order or should there be a problem with your order
	and we need to contact you.
</p>
<p>
	The data we collect and store is your postal address, email, telephone number and date of birth
	along with details of products you have ordered. Debit and Credit card details are never stored by
	us. We offer a service to place a token on your card details to allow for easy ordering in the future,
	however we do not have any access to your card number, expiry date or CVV number. This
	information is handled and protected by Globalpay.
</p>
<p>
	We may request personal data from publicly available sources and/or from third party data vendors.
	If we do this, we will ensure that the data provided has been collected and shared with us only if the
	GDPR regulations and guidelines have been followed when collecting that data.
</p>
<p>
	When you interact with us through our Services, we may collect information from you, as further described below:
</p>
<p>
	<b>a. Information you provide:</b> We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access 
	to our Services or use certain Services. Information we collect may include but not be limited to real name, email address, address, mobile phone number, date of birth, 
	and any other information you upload to our Website or App.
</p>
<p>
	<b>b. Automatically collected information:</b> When you interact with us, we receive and store certain information such as an IP address, 
	device ID, and your activities within the Services. Logging when you access the Services and from where, allows us to better understand our users and keep your account and information safe.
</p>
<p>
	<b>c. Aggregated information:</b> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve our customers of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer 
	demographics, interests and behaviour based on the information collected. We may also disclose aggregated and anonymized user statistics in order to describe 
	our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<p>
	<b>d. Cookies:</b> Like almost all online websites we employ cookies and similar technologies to keep track of your local device's settings and which account you
