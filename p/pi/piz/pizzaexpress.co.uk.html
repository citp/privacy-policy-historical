<p style="line-height: 22.5pt; background: white;"><strong>4. Cookies</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 15pt; background: white;"><strong>4.1</strong> Similar to other commercial websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our Website is used. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies<br>
<br>
<strong>
4.2 </strong>Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Website.<br>
<br>
<strong>
4.3 </strong>Cookies, in conjunction with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Website and which parts of the website are most popular. This helps us gather feedback so that we can improve our Website and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal Information about you and we do not generally store any personal Information that you provided to us in your cookies.<br>
<br>
<strong>

<p style="line-height: 22.5pt; background: white;"><strong>6. What is Accessibility?</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 15pt; background: white;"><strong>6.1</strong> Website accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Website. More specifically, Website accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Website, and that they can contribute to the Website. Website accessibility also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities due to aging. (Quote from https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php)</p>
<p style="line-height: 22.5pt; background: white;"><strong>7. Accessibility Features</strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 15pt; background: white;"><strong>7.1</strong> This Website contains the following features which should help users make the website more accessible:<br>
a) providing a sitemap;<br>
b) every content and decorative image has the ability to have alternative text added so if images are disabled or not appearing the user can see read what the image is displaying;<br>
c) tabbing through the Website is organised in a logical top down left to right order;<br>
d) clearly defined visible hover and focus (tab) state for each link;<br>
e) the ability to jump to the main content on the page by bypassing the top menu when you use the keyboard;<br>
f) HTML for lists, tables and quotes being coded correctly;<br>
g) the ability to navigate around the site and access all functionality by only using the keyboard;<br>
h) all fields and labels within forms including error messages, are clearly labelled and have the correct notations;<br>
i) the visual contrast combination of text and background colours meet the correct ratio so all text is easily read; and<br>
j) the Website is readable when large size text is used in Internet Explorer</p>
<p style="line-height: 22.5pt; background: white;"><strong>8. Commitment to Accessibility</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 15pt; background: white;"><strong>8.1 </strong>At PizzaExpress we are committed to making our Website accessible to as many abled and less abled people as possible.
