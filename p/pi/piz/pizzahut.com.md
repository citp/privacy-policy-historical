**Our Privacy Practices and Children**

From time to time, we might create a special websites or apps for children. This includes our BookIt! programs. This section of the policy describes our privacy practices for these special offerings.

**What We Collect and How We Collect It:** We collect limited personally information from children under 13. We only request that kids give us what is reasonably needed for them to participate in an activity. Information we collect might include name, email address, zip code, school grade, and/or age. We might also collect passive information like what activity the child did or completed, or what program the child used (such as, for example, the collection of minutes read, completion of activities, etc., which we may provide to the parent / legal guardian). We may collect this information directly from a child (for example, if they sign up for a promotion). We also collect information using passive tracking tools. 

**How We Use Children's Information:** We use children's information as described in any request for parental consent. Unless permitted by law, we use children's information after getting parental consent. In some circumstances, we may not request parental consent. For example if we are only going to use the information one time to respond to a direct request, or if we are using information obtained from a child to get parental consent. We use children's information to administer our promotions. This might include notifying winners and prize fulfillment. We might also use children's information in connection with our Book It! programs and activities. We use information to improve children’s experiences with our website and our programs. We might use information for security purposes. 

**Information Sharing and Platform Security:** We will share children's information if we're required to by law. We will share it if Pizza Hut transfers ownership. We will also share children's information with vendors who help us run our programs. We do not currently have any platforms that are designed to let children make their information publicly available. We use industry standard security practices to protect information but we cannot guarantee that you are completely secure. This site may have links to other websites that Pizza Hut may not own or operate. Our privacy practices do not apply to those sites. We don't have control over the content of those sites or their information collection practices.

**Parent's Rights:** Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act you have the right to review and have any of your child's information deleted. You also have the right to tell us to stop collecting or using your child's information. Please contact us as provided in the [More Questions](http://www.pizzahut.com/privacypolicy.html#al7) section and reference COPPA INQUIRY.
