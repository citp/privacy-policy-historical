From time to time we may monitor emails and computer use of our systems by employees. This is done in order to ensure that company systems and email infrastructure are used exclusively for legitimate business purposes and to protect our systems from unauthorized use. We try to minimize intrusiveness when we do this.

We also may use personal information in our files about individuals who were, but are no longer, employed by us, for some of the purposes listed above to the extent necessary to satisfy an obligation which survives employment or to assess a former employee's suitability for new employment with us and to contact individuals about such potential employment opportunities. 

Employees are made aware of the purpose for which their personal information is collected, used or disclosed through the availability of this _Privacy Statement_.

_Sharing of Employee Personal Information_

We may retain a service provider to perform on our behalf certain administrative services in support of our business. Such service providers include our payroll service and our outsourced benefit and RRSP carrier. Accordingly, in certain instances service providers may be provided with personal information to the extent that it is necessary in the performance of those specific administrative services provided to us. We require service providers to use and take steps to protect any personal information we provide to them. At a minimum, they must take precautions to hold information secure and they must adhere to the principles set out in this _Privacy Statement_. Personal information may also be shared with our affiliates. Our affiliates are subject to and abide by this privacy policy.

Sometimes, individuals or organizations may ask for information about our existing or former employees. Typically we do not disclose personal information about our employees or former employees unless specifically directed to do so by the employee or if we are compelled by law or a court order. However, in a tender or other competitive bid process we may be asked to provide information about our individual employees and their credentials, including their résumé and we will disclose this information in these circumstances.

Sometimes our former employees ask us to share their personal information with other organizations for the purposes of an employment reference. We do not provide employment references other than to confirm the position or positions held and the employee's tenure with us. An employee's request for a reference means that we are authorized to disclose such information to the person seeking the reference, or a person acting on their behalf. 

### How do we safeguard Personal Information?

We retain the personal information that we collect for so long as such personal information is useful or may be required. Except where required or authorized at law, when personal information is no longer required for the purposes for which it has been collected, such personal information (if it continues to be in our possession) will be made anonymous or destroyed. 

Personal Information may be stored and processed outside of Canada, including the United States. As such, personal information may be accessed by foreign governmental authorities and otherwise in accordance with the laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which it is stored.

### How can I access and update my Personal Information?
