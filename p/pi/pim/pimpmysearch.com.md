# PimpMySearch.com - Privacy Policy

* * *

**Privacy Policy**

Welcome to PimpMySearch, a Fun Novelty site where you can create your own Personalized search engine & share it with your Friends!. We take your privacy very seriously. To make it easier for you to read and understand our privacy policy, we did the unconventional thing - we wrote this in plain English and tried to keep it to a reasonably short length.

**Information Collected   & Usage**  
When you use PimpMySearch, you may submit personally identifiable information such as your name and email address. We also collect other non-personally identifiable data, which may include your IP address, browser type etc. We use the personally identifiable information (Name, Email) you submit only in your friend invites. We also use your non-personally identifiable data information to measure our website traffic and performance. 

**Email Policies**  
We hate spam like you do. That's why our policy is 

_not to send any email_

except for the user initiated invite emails. Also we send the invites only once and don't send any more remainder emails!. 

All our user-initiated invite emails are clearly marked as such and also feature an [ unsubscribe link](http://invite.pimpmysearch.com/i/stopinvites.php) and postal address in accordance with the CAN-SPAM act. 

**Inviting Friends**  
Inviting friends to PimpMySearch.com is 

_always completely optional_

. When you choose to invite friends, we will send an email (only once) to the addresses you selected, indicating that it is a message from you. Also we will share your name and email address with your invitee so that they know who the invitation is coming from. 

When you choose to invite, we will access your web address book using the login details that you provide. We access your address book only once to retrieve your friends information so that you may select whom to invite. We do not store your login details nor do we use them for any other purpose then to retrieve your contacts. We never send invitations to contacts you do not explicitly select and your invitations are the only email we will ever send to your friends. Also we don't send any more remainder emails other than the initial invite!. 

If you do not wish to receive invitations from your friends you can [unsubscribe](http://invite.pimpmysearch.com/i/stopinvites.php) at any time.
