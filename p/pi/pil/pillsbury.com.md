**The Pillsbury Company Online Privacy Policy**

The Pillsbury Company is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to its Internet site. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the site. However, certain nonpersonal information is recorded by the standard operation of The Pillsbury Company's Internet servers. This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes but is not limited to, the type of operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) and the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer). 

Other uses of this information include internal review of the number of visitors to the site, but only in an aggregate and nonpersonally identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known only when voluntarily submitted. 

Personally identifiable information that may be collected in connection with visitors is retained by The Pillsbury Company and is not sold or otherwise transferred outside the company. This information is collected to help us better understand visitors' use of our site. 

A SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS: To protect the interests of children, it is the policy of The Pillsbury Company that no personal information will be requested on Pillsbury Websites from children 16 years of age or under, without notice to and the consent of a parent or guardian. This information, if collected, is not sold or otherwise transferred outside the company.

Users of Pillsbury Websites should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, etc.) on a "bulletin board" or in a chat area, the information can be collected and used by other Web surfers. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. In addition, Pillsbury Websites may contain links to other sites. We make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of other sites.
