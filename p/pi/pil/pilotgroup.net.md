# Pilot Group - Privacy and Security

**Information Collection & Use** _Registration_  
In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information such as name and email address. We use this information to contact you on site services you have expressed interest in.

Pilot Group LTD is the sole owner of the information collected on www.pilotgroup.net . Your privacy is of high importance to us and we do everything possible to protect any information you provide us.

Our policies are created to maximize your enjoyment and benefit. Pilot Group Ltd values the privacy of all site visitors and customers and does not provide individually identifiable information to third parties.

Pilot Group LTD collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site. If a customer chooses to provide personally identifiable information to Pilot Group Ltd by making a purchase, faxing information, requesting additional information through email or telephone, or communicating directly with Pilot Group Ltd, this information remains secure and will not be used for anything other than the purpose for which it was obtained.

We do not share, rent, sell or otherwise distribute customer information with other persons, companies, affiliates or organizations.

 _Products and Services_  
All products we develop and services we render can be found and purchased on our sites and on some other authorized resources. However there have been cases of unauthorized use of our trademark by third parties in order to distribute their own products or services of similar or even completely different nature.

We ask you to be vigilant against such swindlers so as not to get scammed. If you come across a suspicious resource where products and/or services are offered on our behalf, please contact our [Support Team](http://www.pilotgroup.net/support/) to verify reliability of such resource before making any purchase.

 _Orders_  
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. To process an order made on our site, we require information such as your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information. This information is relayed to us via our shopping cart service and at our payment gateway billing page.

It is used to process your order and possibly contact you by phone or email. This information, and only that information which is absolutely necessary, will be shared with those third parties that are involved in the processing, filling, and shipping of your order. For example: payment gateway you used for order processing.

Pilot Group Ltd may also collect your computer's IP address. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, administer and market our Web site, and track fraudulent credit card transactions. Your IP address is used to help identify you and may be used to gather broad demographic information. No personal information about you (i.e., your name, email address, etc.) is gathered or collected from your IP address. We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

During installation, customization and integration work we can use your access data to your ftp and to your hosting control panel. We do not use this information for any other purposes and do not share them with third party companies.

For security measures we would advise our clients to change ftp server information and admin mode access codes after the work on their site is finished. This guarantees our clients confidence and security of their personal information. We can request this information again if any fixes or new functions are needed.

This site has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored on secure servers and stringent policies govern the use and handling of such information.
