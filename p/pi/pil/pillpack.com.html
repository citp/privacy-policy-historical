You understand that the privacy laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in your country, and you agree that the transfer of your personal information occurs with your consent. Personal information collected on this Online Experience may be stored and processed in the United States or abroad.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</p> <p>We can disclose your personal and other information to third parties, as follows:</p> <p>To vendors whose products or services you have requested, in order to deliver those products or services to you.</p> <p>To our subsidiaries or affiliates, strategic partners and to third parties we engage to provide services on our behalf, such as web sites hosting, credit card payment processing, order processing, delivery, etc. We prohibit these parties from using your personal information for any other purpose.</p> <p>To vendors that offer products, services or other information we think might interest you. These third parties may keep and use your personal information whether or not you purchase their products or services. Your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies, so you should contact them directly for information on their policies or to opt-out of promotional communications from them.</p> <p>In the event of the sale or transfer of PillPack, of one or more of our business units or of some or all of our assets, or in the context of some other business acquisition transaction. In response to a subpoena or court order, or a request from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against claims; or to protect the safety or security of the public or of users of this Online Experience. For example,</p> <p>We may forward your prescription information to your insurance plan, so that we may handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase for your convenience.</p> <p>We can disclose aggregate information about users of the Online Experience to our service providers, partners, advertisers or others, but such information will not include personal information.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information</p> <p>You can correct or update your personally identifiable information by re-registering or by contacting us by electronic-mail <a href="mailto:hello@pillpack.com">hello@pillpack.com</a> or by telephone 1-855-745-4525. It may take us up to 30 days to process your request.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Do we use “cookies”?</p> <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. Cookies help us in many ways to make your use of the Online Experience more enjoyable and meaningful, such as understanding usage patterns and improving functionality of the Online Experience. For instance, we use cookies to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current Online Experience activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Online Experience traffic and Online Experience interaction so that we can offer better Online Experience experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our Online Experience visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p> <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your Online Experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Safeguarding Your Personal InformationPrivacy and Third Party Links</p> <p>PillPack follows generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use such personal information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems. Other than the these security measures, you transmit data, including personal information, to us at your own risk.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Privacy and Third Party Links</p> <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Online Experience, www.mypillpack.com.
