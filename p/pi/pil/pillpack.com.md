Do we use “cookies”?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. Cookies help us in many ways to make your use of the Online Experience more enjoyable and meaningful, such as understanding usage patterns and improving functionality of the Online Experience. For instance, we use cookies to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current Online Experience activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Online Experience traffic and Online Experience interaction so that we can offer better Online Experience experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our Online Experience visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your Online Experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.
