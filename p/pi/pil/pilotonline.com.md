**HOW AND WHY WE GATHER INFORMATION FROM USERS**

We collect limited amounts and types of personal information from users of our sites.  The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.

**Personal information:**  
How we collect and store user personal information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our sites without providing any information. Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for services or access to portions of our sites, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g., newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a newspaper subscription, complete a survey  or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you participate in a promotion, sweepstake or contest, voting and polling activities, post comments to blogs, message boards and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our sites. We and/or our third party partners may use this information to process and maintain your account and compile demographic statistics about our users. 

**E-Mail Newsletters**  
If you choose to receive them, HamptonRoads.com will periodically send you e-mail newsletters or promotional e-mail about services offered by HamptonRoads.com and our advertisers. For details about our email newsletters, please [click here](http://hamptonroads.com/alerts).

**Mobile Messaging Service**  
HamptonRoads.com uses the information collected from your interaction with our sites by Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.

HamptonRoads.com collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and HamptonRoads.com. When you send a text message to HamptonRoads.com, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. HamptonRoads.com uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service. 

Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose personal information on our sites, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of HamptonRoads.com and this policy.

**Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology:**

Like most web sites, we also collect and aggregate information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use “cookie” technology. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our sites. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the sites and to take advantage of most personalized services offered. Additionally we may not be able to customize the sites’ features according to your preferences.

Third-party advertising companies: We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on HamptonRoads.com. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our web sites. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. We do not control the placement or the acceptance of cookies from domains other than HamptonRoads.com. To learn more about advertising targeting technology and opt-out from being tracked by participating advertising companies, visit [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

Third-party analytic systems: HamptonRoads.com is currently using and has contracted with Google Analytics, a third party, to track and analyze aggregated usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to help us administer our web sites and constantly improve their quality. All data collected by Google Analytics on behalf of HamptonRoads.com is owned and used by HamptonRoads.com. HamptonRoads.com reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. For more information about Google's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>. We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.

Credit card information will be provided to third parties only to provide products and services that you order. We may use the contact information you provide to contact you about your account and/or to send you necessary information directly related to the product(s) or service(s) for which you have registered. With your permission, we may use your contact information to inform you of new features and special offers from us. We will not provide your contact information to unaffiliated third parties without your express permission. As part of the registration process, you have the option to inform us that you do not wish to receive information about other special offers and promotions. 

**Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements**  
We expect our partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our sites may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices with terms that differ from the terms in our Privacy Policy, and that we do not control. For example, during your visit to our sites you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through HamptonRoads.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. HamptonRoads.com is not responsible for such third party content or for the actions or policies of the third parties providing such content. You should check the applicable terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties before providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.

While on our sites, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our sites, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. HamptonRoads.com does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:  
1.    To recognize you, provide personalization and deliver more individualized content and advertising.  
2.    To improve the content and design of our sites, including by allowing HamptonRoads.com's editors to consult with readers.

7.    To enable audit bureaus and third party advertisers to verify our claims of traffic to our sites.  
8.    To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the sites for their ad campaigns.  
9.    To allow advertising to be targeted, based on aggregated, non-personally identifiable usage information, to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent.  
10.    HamptonRoads.com may share personal information with Virginian-Pilot Media Companies for analysis purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships.

**Future uses**  
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
