          Pillsbury Company Online Privacy Policy</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Pillsbury Company 
          is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to its Internet 
          site. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically 
          collected from visitors to the site. However, certain nonpersonal information 
          is recorded by the standard operation of The Pillsbury Company's Internet 
          servers. This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online 
          experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes but is not 
          limited to, the type of operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) 
          and the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet 
          Explorer). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other uses of this 
          information include internal review of the number of visitors to the 
          site, but only in an aggregate and nonpersonally identifiable form. 
          E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors 
          to this site are known only when voluntarily submitted. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Personally identifiable 
          information that may be collected in connection with visitors is retained 
          by The Pillsbury Company and is not sold or otherwise transferred outside 
          the company. This information is collected to help us better understand 
          visitors' use of our site. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A SPECIAL NOTE 
          TO PARENTS: To protect the interests of children, it is the policy of 
          The Pillsbury Company that no personal information will be requested 
          on Pillsbury Websites from children 16 years of age or under, without 
          notice to and the consent of a parent or guardian. This information, 
          if collected, is not sold or otherwise transferred outside the company.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Users of Pillsbury 
          Websites should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal 
          information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, etc.) on a "bulletin board" 
          or in a chat area, the information can be collected and used by other 
          Web surfers. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters 
          or parties. In addition, Pillsbury Websites may contain links to other 
          sites. We make every effort to link only to sites that share our high 
          standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for 
          the content or the privacy practices of other sites. <br>
          The Pillsbury Company reserves the right to change this privacy policy 
          at any time, and will immediately post the updated policy on its site.
