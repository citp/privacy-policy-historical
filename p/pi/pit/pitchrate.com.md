We only provide third-party agents with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction.

While navigating PitchRate.com's web site you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third party supplier, not hosted on PitchRate.com.  When information is collected on behalf of PitchRate.com exclusively, PitchRate.com's privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used.

It is PitchRate.com's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with PitchRate.com's privacy and security policies.

We will ask you for your opt-in consent to share your personal information with a third party for any other reason.

Teach children never to give personal information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.
