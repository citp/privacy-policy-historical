    <p>Last updated August 9, 2007</p>
<p>By visiting this website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not provide any information or use any of the services or products offered or provided on this website.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy changes from time to time and changes are effective upon posting. Please check back frequently for updates as it is your sole responsibility to be aware of changes. We do not provide notices of changes in any manner other than by posting the changes at this website.</p>
<p>This policy describes the information collection, use and dissemination practices of Pitchfork Media, Inc. ("Pitchfork") and applies to Pitchfork's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Pitchfork on its website located at the URL <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" title="www.pitchforkmedia.com">www.pitchforkmedia.com</a> (the "Website"). Pitchfork is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or applications. Pitchfork suggests that you read the privacy statements of each linked website to understand what, if any, personally identifiable information may be collected by those linked websites.</p>
<p>Because of its importance and to make it easier for you to find and review it, we have made this Privacy Policy into a separate document on the Website.

North Avenue, #2, Chicago, Illinois 60622 ATTN: Privacy Officer.

<p>GENERAL</p>
<p>Pitchfork is the sole owner of the Website and all information collected on the Website. Pitchfork may occasionally collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from its Website users who respond to surveys on the Website prepared and sponsored by Pitchfork. That PII is stored and managed by Pitchfork. Pitchfork does not currently sell, share or rent this information.</p>
<p>Pitchfork may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process (e.g., in response to a court order or a subpoena). Pitchfork may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where Pitchfork believes it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law. Pitchfork may also transfer information about you if it is dissolved and its assets are sold or donated.</p>
<p>This Website is operated in the United States of America. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide will be transferred to the United States. By using this Website you consent to this transfer.</p>
<p>Third parties who provide hosting services or other day-to-day services that make possible the operation of this Website may have access to information that you provide to the extent they require access to our databases to service the Website.</p>
<p>INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>
<p>Pitchfork does not currently collect or sell to third parties personally identifying information from Website users. E-mails received by Pitchfork from Website users are stored for a period of time and then deleted. Refer to the Terms of Use and the Website for Pitchfork's policy regarding the publishing of Website user e-mails.</p>
<p>Pitchfork may sponsor contests and promotions on the Website. When you enter a contest or other promotion conducted on this Website, we may ask for your name, postal address, e-mail address and other PII so we can administer the contest/promotion and notify winners. Pitchfork may share this information with third parties serving as Pitchfork's partners in such contests or promotions.</p>
<p>COOKIES</p>
<p>Pitchfork does not presently use cookies or web beacon technology but reserves the right to use them and other new and evolving sources of information in the future. A "cookie" is a small data file that a website owner may write into your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit that site again but does not contain any PII. Cookies allow that site to measure activity on the site and enhance your experience by saving you from having to long in or provide information each time you re-visit the site and by customizing content based on your interests. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on the Website. Such third party use of cookies is subject to that party's own privacy policies which may differ from this one. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at the Website and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.</p>
<p>A "web beacon" is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an  programming function), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This would allow a website owner to track certain website an individual visits online. Pitchfork uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Website, track your movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifying use.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks and other companies (collectively, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Website and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about individuals. Pitchfork does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and Pitchfork has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about individuals.</p>
<p>SUBSCRIBERS</p>
<p>Pitchfork may, from time to time, publish a newsletter or other periodical document. In order to receive a copy of this document, Pitchfork will ask you for certain PII including, without limitation, your e-mail address. In order to discontinue receipt of this document, simply unsubscribe through the manner prescribed in the last such document you received. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Pitchfork reserves the right to provide this PII to third parties.</p>
<p>CHILDREN AND PRIVACY</p>
<p>From time to time, content on the Website may be of interest to teenagers. Pitchfork, however, does not intentionally or knowingly gather information from children 13 years of age or younger. No information should be submitted to or posted on the Website by users under the age of 13 years without consent of their parent or adult legal guardian. In the event Pitchfork collects information from a person between the ages of 14 and 17, that information will be subject to use as allowed by this Privacy Policy provided that the teenager, his/her parent or his/her adult legal guardian may stop that use upon request. In the event Pitchfork becomes aware that a person 13 years of age or younger is providing Pitchfork with PII, Pitchfork will request parental permission or Pitchfork will delete the PII from its database. Pitchfork relies on users to be truthful in responding to questions about age.</p>
<p>MESSAGE BOARD AND CHAT ROOMS</p>
<p>Pitchfork does not presently host message boards, chat rooms or user comment sections but reserves the right to do so in the future.</p>
<p>SECURITY</p>
<p>Pitchfork has put in place (or has required its data management agents to put in place) appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information Pitchfork collects on-line. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that PII that Pitchfork may collect in the future will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
