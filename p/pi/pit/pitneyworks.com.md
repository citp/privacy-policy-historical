Under the program, we are required to provide particular information to USPS. This information is used for postage account licensing and postage payment activities. This information includes name, address and contact information as well as information about your mailing behavior such as estimated postage volume.

While not required by the United States Post Office, we also verify recipient addresses with the USPS' Address Matching System (AMS), a database containing all valid United States addresses. Recipient names and addresses are collected to compare them to the AMS database.

As required by USPS IBIP regulations, during the normal use of any internet-based postage delivery service ("Service"), you will provide mailing information for the generation of the postal indicia for the Service. In order to generate valid indicia, such Services may be required to collect and record the following information:

  


  * Date and time of transaction
  * Ascending and Descending Register value of Postage Meter
  * Rate Category
  * Recipient ZIP Code



The Service does not store recipient name and address information (except ZIP code), nor does it record the addresses of the mail you send. All information collected for USPS purposes is maintained in a secure environment in accordance with the provisions of this Statement. For more information on the USPS and the IBIP regulations please visit http://www.usps.com/common/docs/privpol.htm.
