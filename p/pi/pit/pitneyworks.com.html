									<div class="bodyText">
										<p>Effective July 1, 2004. The following describes Pitney Bowes' collection, use and disclosure of information gathered from online visitors to certain websites owned and operated by Pitney Bowes.</p>

<br>
<p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:webmaster@pb.com">webmaster@pb.com.</a></p>

<br>
<p>This web site is the responsibility of Pitney Bowes Inc. Pitney Bowes can be contacted by mail at 1 Elmcroft Road, Stamford, CT 06926-0700, attention Corporate Communications or by e-mail at webmaster@pb.com.

<br>
<p><strong>3. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</strong></p>

<br>
<p>We maintain a secured area on our Sites for transmission of personal data, and store all personal data in a private database which is not connected to the Internet. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the personal data you provide to us, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of such data due to errors in transmission or interception by unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>

<br>
<p>We may, from time to time, make certain contact information about our customers available to third parties for the following purposes: we may disclose information to vendors who facilitate and/or support our customer transactions; we may disclose information to entities to whom we are legally required to disclose information; and/or we may disclose information to third parties with whom we have relationships through which permission-based marketing is conducted.</p>

<br>
<p>Any third party with whom we have a relationship pursuant to which we provide, rent, sell or otherwise disclose data collected from visitors to our site will be carefully pre-screened, determined by us to be reputable, and will use the data provided solely for marketing products and services which we determine, in our sole judgment, that visitors to our Sites might find of interest.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>4. Opt-Out Rights</strong></p>

<br>
<p><strong>8. United States Postal Service Requirements</strong></p>

<br>
<p>We must comply with certain postage generation and PC Postage product user registration requirements, as set by the United States Postal Service (USPS) Information Based Indicia Program (IBIP). (The Information Based Indicia (IBI) is the item printed on an envelope that conveys evidence that postage has been paid and contains mail processing data requirements, including security-related data elements.) Under the program, we are required to provide particular information to USPS. This information is used for postage account licensing and postage payment activities. This information includes name, address and contact information as well as information about your mailing behavior such as estimated postage volume.</p>

<br>
<p>While not required by the United States Post Office, we also verify recipient addresses with the USPS' Address Matching System (AMS), a database containing all valid United States addresses. Recipient names and addresses are collected to compare them to the AMS database.</p>

<br>
<p>As required by USPS IBIP regulations, during the normal use of any internet-based postage delivery service ("Service"), you will provide mailing information for the generation of the postal indicia for the Service. In order to generate valid indicia, such Services may be required to collect and record the following information:</p>

<br>
<ul>
<li>Date and time of transaction</li>

<li>Ascending and Descending Register value of Postage Meter</li>

<li>Rate Category</li>

<li>Recipient ZIP Code</li>
</ul>

<p>The Service does not store recipient name and address information (except ZIP code), nor does it record the addresses of the mail you send. All information collected for USPS purposes is maintained in a secure environment in accordance with the provisions of this Statement. For more information on the USPS and the IBIP regulations please visit http://www.usps.com/common/docs/privpol.htm.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>9. Company's Right to Change Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<br>
<p>By using the Sites, you signify your assent to this Statement. If you do not agree with the terms of this Statement, please do not visit our Sites. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Statement at any time. Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes to these terms shall be deemed your consent to any such changes. Such changes will be evidenced by a change in the effective date for this Statement set forth above.</p>
