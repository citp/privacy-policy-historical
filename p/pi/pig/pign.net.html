<center><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></center>

<p><b>* We do not collect any personal or individually identifiable information, or email addresses. The only information that we have about our users is a record of their surfing through our service, contained in our proxy logs. In these logs, users are identifiable only by their IP number (network address). These logs contain a record of web access made to and through our service. These proxy logs are not revealed to anyone outside of our organization, except such small portions that may be needed to confirm abuse, and are deleted on a regular basis. Our rules about revealing IPs are described in our abuse policy above.</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* We do not share the email address of people who contact us with any third party.</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* Our site uses login cookies to store temporary login information. These cookies are not used for tracking users; they are used only to keep a login session open. Once a session is over, the login cookies are no longer used. We use non-persistent cookies that automatically expire and are deleted after you exit your browser. These cookies are not correlated with individual user identities. These cookies are technically necessary for using our service, and cannot be disabled. You may also elect to store your preferred settings in one or more persistent cookies.</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* Our site may also set some cookies to control what advertisements are shown. For example, we may use cookies to ensure that we do not repeatedly show you pop-up advertisements. The only information contained in these cookies is what time a particular user saw a particular advertisement. These cookies may persist for several days.</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* Our site is secure to the best of our abilities. We do our utmost to keep our site safe from unauthorized access, and to minimize the number of people who have access to sensitive information. We cannot absolutely guarantee the security of our site, and cannot be responsible for breaches of security.</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* All use of our site is confidential. We only reveal information if legally required to do so, or if there is clear evidence of abuse our system, as defined in our abuse policy (above) and terms and conditions (above).</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* You should assume that we will comply with court orders or subpoenas demanding log files entries, as we do not know our users and therefore cannot mount a legal challenge.</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* We keep records of accesses to our site for a short time (several days). We may use these records to pursue people who engage in an abuse of our services. Otherwise, we do not share these records with any third party, and we delete them after a short time (several days).</b></p>
<hr>
<b></b><p><b>* We may run advertisements on our site. Our advertisers have separate privacy policies. You are exposed to our advertisers at the onset and termination of surfing using our service.</b></p>
