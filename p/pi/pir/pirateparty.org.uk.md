# Privacy Policy - Pirate Party UK

VISITOR PRIVACY POLICY V2.0 for Pirate Party UK (pirateparty.org.uk)

Why We have a Policy, and How it Works.

The Party understands the importance of your privacy when using its services (including this website), or communicating with its officials. This Privacy Policy is designed to explain how we deal with any personal information we may get from you.

This Policy may be changed from time to time so if you are interested, do read through it, and check back every so often. When any substantial changes are made, we will send an email to all registered users of the website letting you know this has happened - unless you have opted out of such emails.

If you have any questions, comments, ideas or requests relating to this policy specifically, or your privacy whilst using our services, you can contact our Data Controller via: h.faggetter@pirateparty.org.uk

Information You Give Us Directly  
In order to run this website we need to collect, and in some cases process, some information about you. This includes information that you've given to us, such as details you've entered on forms during the signup / membership process or entered as part of commenting on the forums or blog. We may also need to collect details of any communications that you've sent to us.

Information You Give Us Indirectly  
We may gather and process information about your visits to the site that we get from you or your browser, such as which pages you go to, information and the resources that you've  used. We may also obtain limited information on your usage through third parties (such as through the Google Analytics service, discussed below).

We may also need to collect information from your computer so that we can run our services efficiently. This data can be used for statistical analysis about our website and to ensure certain parts, such as the forum, can function.

Any indirect information we get will not identify who you are, but will be numerical data about our visitors and what you do on publicly accessible areas of the site. This information will not contain or process any personal details.

We might use Cookies to store some of this non-identifiable information. Cookies are small files that are automatically downloaded to and stored on your computer. If you don't wish to allow Cookies to be used on your computer, you should be able to disable them through your browser:

  * In  **Firefox**  go to the  _Privacy_  tab in the  _Options  _panel, then select  _"Never remember history_ " from the dropdown menu.
  * In  **Internet Explorer  9** by going to  _Privacy_  tab in the  _Internet Options_  menu, then move the slider up to the top.
  * In  **Chrome**  going to  _Options >Under the Hood>Privacy>Content Settings_.



Do note that some functions on our website need Cookies to work, so you may have problems using our website with them disabled. If you have any problems with Cookies (or disabling them), let us know and we will try to help.

What We Do with Your Information

We will never give your information to a third party without your explicit permission, unless compelled to do so by law (for example, if you go over the donation limits and we are required to notify the Electoral Commission).

Any information about you that we do collect and store will be used to help us provide a better service. Much of this information is voluntary, we limit the information we require from our users to the minimum required by Law (in terms of  Membership of the Party) and to the minimum required to provide a service (in terms of website account for use of the Forums).

We may use any contact details you provide to give you information about our campaigns, services, and ongoing development. You are able to opt out of these messages at any time using the [ [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/accounts/subscriptions/](https://web.archive.org/accounts/subscriptions/) ] settings page.

We may use any information we collect to fulfull any commitments we've made to you, if the information is needed to do so.

Storing Your Information  
All information about you that we store will be kept on our secure servers, and any transfer of data will be encrypted to protect your privacy.  Sadly data transfer using the Internet is never completely secure, so we are unable to completely guarantee the security of your information, but will take all reasonable steps (and probably some unreasonable ones) to maintain your privacy.

Other Stuff  
This Policy only applies to services and websites under the control of the Party. It does not apply to any other websites or services that we, or users of our services, may link to.

The Data Protection Act 1998 gives you rights to access any information about you that we have stored. Such a request can be made through our Data Controller: h.faggetter@pirateparty.org.uk. We will only charge for this in exceptional circumstances, but we cannot guarantee a immediate response. We will aim to comply with your request as soon as is reasonable practical.

Google Analytics uses "cookies" alongside those we use, discussed above.  The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website  (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google  on servers in the United States.
