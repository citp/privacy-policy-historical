# Privacy Policy | Pirate101 Free Online Game

KingsIsle Entertainment, Inc. (“KingsIsle,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to protecting and safeguarding consumer privacy on the Internet, especially for children. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we handle the personal information provided to us on our websites and mobile applications, and collected through participation in, in-game play of, or any other use of our sites or environments, such as Wizard101, Pirate101 or any other games/environments that we may provide in the future (all collectively, the “Site”). The Site may include access to downloadable software or applications for use on personal computers, tablets, mobile devices or phones. When you submit data to the Site, you are submitting data to us in the United States and that data is collected and maintained in, and subject to the laws of, the United States. 

Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using this Site or submitting information to us. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of this Site constitutes acceptance of such changes, so please check this area periodically for updates to this Privacy Policy. 

**INFORMATION KINGSISLE COLLECTS FROM YOU**

KingsIsle may collect information through your active submission of information or passively through use of automated technologies. Please see the Section below titled “Special Notes About Children Under 13” for the process we use to limit information collected from children under the age of the 13. PLEASE NOTE: you may have a separate account for each environment or game of ours included in the Site that you register for, or you may be able to use a single account across all of our environments and games. In either case, this Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Site and each separate environment or component thereof. 

**Active Information Collection**

Much of the personally identifiable information we collect from our visitors is submitted by visitors in response to our requests, such as during the registration process, or in response to polls, forums, promotional offers or other interactivity incorporated into the Site. From time-to-time, visitors may also submit personally identifiable information directly to us via e-mail. The information we actively collect may include some or all of the following: 

\-- Name   
\-- Date of Birth   
\-- Address (including City, State, Country and/or Zip Code)   
\-- E-Mail Address   
\-- Username   
\-- Password   
\-- Gender   
\-- Information Regarding Your Computer Hardware and Network Connectivity

Finally, we may require you to submit billing information to pay any fees applicable to participation in the Site. Depending on the type of payment method, this billing information may include credit card or comparable payment account number, billing address, name on card/account, expiration date and security code. 

For some of our online activities - such as polls or surveys - we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence, favorite color or feedback or suggestions for the Site. 

**Passive Information Collection**

As you navigate through the Site and participate in the gaming environment, other information may be collected through use of technologies which are common among websites and online environments. For example, we may track IP addresses, use session, persistent and flash cookies, and evaluate access time and navigational data in connection with the Site. “Cookies” are small pieces of information or files that the Site puts on your computer which allow KingsIsle to accumulate data on your navigation of the Site and ease such navigation (e.g., by allowing your computer to save your username and password). We may also use web beacons and any other successor tracker technology used in the industry in connection with the Site. Within the gaming environment, we may also collect information on your in-game activities, character development and character interaction. 

We may also use technology to passively gather operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer, operating systems, Internet service providers and the domain name of the web site that linked you to the Site. 

In addition to the above information, when you access our Site on a mobile platform (e.g., iOS or Android), we may collect certain additional information such as your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, media access control ("MAC") address, international mobile equipment identity ("IMEI"), the version of your mobile operating system, the platform used to access or download the Site (e.g., Apple, Google, Amazon, Windows), and Internet Protocol address.

We may tie personally identifiable information actively collected from you to information collected passively as described above or from third parties. 

**Do Not Track:** Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates. The webserver for our Site does not currently respond to these signals.

**INTERACTION WITH SIGN-IN SERVICES AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS**

From time-to-time, the Site may allow you to log in using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, Apple’s Game Center, or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and may provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name, email address, and resume to pre-populate our sign up form. Once your identity has been authenticated, we may collect certain information such as the sign-in service used and a unique identification code associated with the sign-on service. 

From time-to-time, the Site may also contain functionality which enables you to import profile information or contacts from third party services (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, FourSquare, Instagram, Vine, etc.) (collectively, “Third Party Social Media Accounts”). If you choose to do this, you may have to log into the applicable Third Party Social Media Account, using such account’s user name and password. The copy of the information received by us shall be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any data maintained by such third party service and your use of that third party service will be subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policy. You may have the ability to post information from the Site to your Third Party Social Media Accounts (including, without limitation, by taking advantages of features such as the Facebook “like” button appearing on the Site). All such postings are also subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of the applicable third parties as well as the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**HOW KINGSISLE USES YOUR INFORMATION**

KingsIsle uses your personal information to enable you to register for the Site. We also use this information to manage your use of the Site and support operation of the Site generally. We use any billing information you provide to collect any fees due in connection with your use of the Site. We may also use your personal information to send you updates and information about the Site and KingsIsle’s products and services. 

Although we do not generally give your personal information to third parties, we may disclose your information to KingsIsle’s vendors that provide technical support or other services to KingsIsle related to the Site. For example, we may provide your information to companies that host the Site or process credit card information. However, these vendors may not use your personally identifiable information for any reason other than assisting KingsIsle and are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information. 

We reserve the right to disclose information if required to do so by law or by a regulatory authority. We may also disclose your information as part of an investigation or enforcement action relating to improper or illegal conduct in connection with our Site, including, without limitation, any situations that may potentially involve threats to the safety or privacy of any person, misuse of the Site or violation of the Terms of Use. 

If a third party acquires the assets of KingsIsle related to the Site, its products and services, or any component thereof (whether by sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy or otherwise), copies of your information may be transferred to the new owner(s). In such case, your information would remain subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy until you consent to the new owner’s applicable privacy policy. 

KingsIsle may maintain aggregate data or other non-personally identifiable information about our users, such as usage statistics, online traffic patterns and user feedback. In addition to using this information to support operation of the Site, KingsIsle may disclose this information to third parties without restriction. 

**SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT CHILDREN UNDER 13**

Except as described below, KingsIsle will not ask children under the age of 13 who register to use the Site hereafter to submit any personally identifiable information. The only information requested from children under 13 will be a username and a user password. We may also ask such users to answer one or more security questions that do not request personally identifiable information. PLEASE NOTE: it is critical that users under the age of 13 retain their passwords because KingsIsle may not be able to reset the passwords when we have not collected a user or parental e-mail address. 

If it becomes necessary to collect personal information from children under 13, KingsIsle will only do so after obtaining verifiable parental consent, as defined under COPPA, or as otherwise permitted under COPPA. For example, COPPA permits collection of personal information where (i) the sole purpose of collecting online contact information from a child is to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child, and where such information is not used to re-contact the child or for any other purpose; (ii) the purpose of collecting a child’s and a parent’s name and online contact information is to protect the safety of a child; or (iii) KingsIsle collects online contact information of the child’s parent or guardian to obtain parental consent or to provide voluntary notice and/or updates to the parent or guardian about participation in the Site. 

On our Site, we offer many features, such as the ability to view or download game content or images, news, or participate in forums, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. KingsIsle will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. We also may enable users to chat online through our Site, but we take measures to limit users’ ability to communicate personal information through this chat function. 

**Parental Review of Personally Identifiable Information**

In certain circumstances on some Sites, parents will have the ability to set up parental accounts to administer their children’s accounts and review the personally identifiable information maintained by KingsIsle from such accounts. Parents or guardians may establish a parental account during the initial registration process for the child’s account or, subsequently, through the account management features applicable to the child’s account. Although a child over the age of 13 may register without the electronic consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian may also submit a request to KingsIsle at the contact information below to review any personally identifiable information from such child. However, such requests will be subject to the parent or guardian demonstrating proper identification to KingsIsle’s satisfaction after reasonable investigation 

**CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW KINGSISLE USES YOUR INFORMATION**

You have the following choices regarding the personally identifiable information you provide for KingsIsle to use: 

You may send us an e-mail message at Privacy@KingsIsle.com to request access to review, correct or delete any personally identifiable information maintained on our systems that you or your child has provided to us through the Site registration process or other request. To protect your privacy, we will respond only to e-mail messages sent from the e-mail account that you specified (or was given by your child) during the account registration process. 

You may also opt out of receiving newsletters and other promotional materials from KingsIsle by notifying us at Privacy@KingsIsle.com. 

If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of this Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly. 

**HOW KINGSISLE PROTECTS YOUR INFORMATION**

We work hard to protect your personal information. We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including giving users a unique user name and password for access to the Site, SSL encryption for data transfer, firewalls, and restricted access to data. 

However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should never share your password with anyone else and you should always logoff before leaving your computer or device. You should also use password security on your device itself. If you believe someone has unauthorized access to your password or account, please contact us promptly. 

This Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties that may be of interest to you (including links embedded in advertising appearing on components of the Site or related applications). When you follow a link and leave this Site, you do so at your own risk because we do not control such third party websites. 

**YOUR CHOICE TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS**

This Site may also include forums, chat functionality or other features where you can exchange information or otherwise interact with other users of the Site. When you do so, you understand that all information transmitted will be made available to and accessible by the Company and applicable users. You have no expectation of privacy in connection with such communications. The Company is not responsible for whether or how such third parties utilize the information you post or share through such features.
