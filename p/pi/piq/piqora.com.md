# Piqora (Formerly Pinfluencer) - Complete Marketing Suite for Pinterest

Welcome to Piqora, the online and mobile service of Piqora, Inc. (“Piqora,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

### HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use www.piqora.com/terms.

We collect the following types of information about you:

**Information you provide us directly:** We ask for certain information such as your email address and Pinterest board URL when you register for a Piqora account. We may also collect any information you choose to provide if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. If you choose to sign up for a premium account, any payment information you provide will be collected and stored by our third party payment processor. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.

**Information we may receive from third parties:** We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you connect your User account to a third-party connection or log-in, for example, by linking your Facebook or Twitter account to the Piqora Service, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Piqora. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Piqora Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.

**Analytics information:** We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

**Cookies information:** When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Piqora help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.

However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**Clear gifs/web beacons information:** When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.
