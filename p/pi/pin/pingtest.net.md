We may collect, store and use non-personal data about your visits to and use of our websites. Additionally, when you use the services on speedtest.net or pingtest.net, we will collect the following anonymous data:

### Information About Visiting Our Websites

We may collect information about your computer and your visits to our websites such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of pageviews. We may use this information in the administration of our websites, to improve their usability, and for marketing purposes.

We use cookies on our websites. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We may send a cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of our websites, to improve their usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our websites, and to personalize our websites for you.

We may use anonymous cookies to record non-personal information such as website activity, date and time of visit, and domain type. We may use this information for retargeting purposes. 

For some of the ads served on our websites, Google uses a DoubleClick DART cookie to identify your past browsing history and then serve you relevant ads on any of their advertising partner websites. You can opt out of this kind of cookie tracking by using the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out Tool.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies overall and for specific websites. This can, however, impact the usability of many websites, including any of ours.

### Using Your Personal Data

Personal data submitted on our websites will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website in question. In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may use your personal information to:

* Improve your browsing experience by personalizing our websites
* Send information (other than marketing communications) to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email or similar technology

### Using Your Non-Personal Data

We use your non-personal and anonymous data in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:

#### Advertising Services

Non-personal data is collected and shared with the service AdRoll to provide relevant and targeted advertisements through retargeting. All data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify the visitor. Retargeting recognizes that the internet browser has visited any of our websites in the last 90 days. If you don’t want to participate in retargeting, you may opt-out of AdRoll’s services.

#### Broadband Performance Data Services

The information we collect via the broadband and mobile performance tests run on either speedtest.net or pingtest.net is done so anonymously and is then aggregated for a few different broadband performance data services. We do so with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for organizations around the world. This anonymous, aggregated data can be accessed via subscription services or via our publicly-available data repository, NetIndex.

### Other Disclosures

In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:

  * To the extent that we are required to do so by law
  * In connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings
  * In order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk)
  * To enforce our agreements, protect our application integrity and require or enforce our terms of use
  * To protect the rights, property or safety of Ookla, our employees, agents, customers and others



In connection with a merger, acquisition or other sale of significant assets of our company, we may transfer all of our data regarding broadband performance, including individual broadband test results, to the acquiring company. We commit to first get their binding assurance that they also abide by all privacy laws and generally accepted privacy policies.

### Security of Your Personal Data

We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. Of course, data transmission over the Internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.

We will store all the personal information you provide on our secure servers.

### Third Party Websites

Our websites contain links to other websites and some of our services are accessed through third party sites. They may send us information, including personal information to us as part of our arrangement with them to provide you with a better experience. We process that information under this Privacy Policy and do not store it unless you ask us to during Registration. In general, the information you provide to such sites will be governed by their privacy policies.

### Policy Amendments

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our websites. We’ll change the Last Updated date at the top of the page each time we change this policy, so please check back occasionally to review any updates.
