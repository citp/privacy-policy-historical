Last updated December 29, 2015.

The Pinot’s Palette name and reputation were built on a foundation of trust. This Pinot’s Palette Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how Pinot’s Palette Franchise LLC, its franchise studios, affiliated companies, and its authorized agents, employees, and assignees (collectively, “Pinot’s Palette”) collect, use, and disclose personal information through (i) PinotsPalette.com and other websites owned or operated by Pinot’s Palette, mobile applications, and online services that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Sites”), and (ii) Pinot’s Palette’s programs and physical stores (collectively, the “Services”). Each individual or entity that engages in Pinot’s Palette’s Sites or Services (each, a “Customer”) expressly agrees to the practices described in this Policy, and agrees that such Customer has read and understood this Policy.

This Policy does not apply to websites and services that display or link to different privacy statements. Websites and services co-branded with other partners may display or link to a joint privacy statement or separate privacy statements of Pinot’s Palette’s partners in addition to our Policy.

In addition, the Sites use targeting or advertising cookies to see which areas and features are popular.

These cookies are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission.

Examples include:

  * Allow “Like” and “Share” buttons to work; and

Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, Online Use Information can be tied to a Customer’s cookies.

The Customer may choose to remove or reject cookies, but doing so will affect many features or services on the Sites.
