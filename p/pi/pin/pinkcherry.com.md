Privacy & Security

At PinkCherry.com (a division of TBMBM, Inc.), we know that your privacy and security while shopping online is very important. Below, please find the top privacy and security-related questions and answers.

What do you do with the information that you collect from me when I purchase a product?

All sales information is kept confidential and is used only for reporting purposes at PinkCherry.com. We DO NOT sell or distribute this information in any form to 3rd parties.

Why do you need my email address?

Your email address is used only to communicate with you directly and efficiently. It will be used to let you know that your order has been processed, your product(s) have been shipped, and about updates to our product lines or web site. You can remove yourself permanently from the email list at any time, simply contact us.

What about cookies?

Cookies are a method used to track a customer through their sales process for statistical and shopping cart purposes. We use this information to help us provide you with a better shopping experience; it is never shared with any 3rd parties. For example, it has helped us create a system where you can purchase a product with fewer clicks thus saving you time.

How do you make sure my credit card information is secure?

We use SSL (Secured Socket Layer) which encrypts the information that you input. This is the same level of protection used by the banks and financial institutions to ensure that your bank account information can be viewed online.

How do you keep my information discreet on my credit card statement and shipping box?

We use a plain box and ship under our parent company TBMBM. Your credit card statement will also show TBMBM.
