			<div class="p">
				<b>Our Commitment to Privacy</b>
				<p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine 
				the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in 
				dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in 
				understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you 
				provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site
				 and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed 
				 against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>
				
				<b>What Information Do We Collect?</b>
				<p>When you visit 
				<a href="http://www.pinnaclecart.com">www.pinnaclecart.com</a> 
				you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you 
				knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web 
				site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse 
				our Web site.</p>
				
				
				<b>ADDITIONAL FEES</b>
				<p>Based upon the Pinnacle Cart Software Service package, additional costs 
				will be charged as follows: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Pinnacle Cart Software</b> – Pinnacle Cart Software 
							Service packages include a base amount of hard disk space 
							(200 megabytes) and a base amount of bandwidth (5 gigabytes). 
							The following costs are incurred for any overage beyond the 
							Pinnacle Cart Software Service.
							<ul>
								<li>$10/month for each additional 1-100 megabytes 
								over base amount.</li>
								<li>$4.50 for each additional gigabyte over base amount. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<b>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</b>
				<p><b>Credit Card Information</b></p>
				<p>If you choose to purchase products or services from our partners, 
				or us you may need to give personal information and authorization to 
				obtain information from various credit services. For example, you may 
				need to provide the following information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Mailing address</li>
						<li>Email address</li>
						<li>Credit card number</li>
						<li>Home and business phone number</li>
						<li>Other personal information (i.e. mother’s maiden name)</li>
					</ul>
				<b>Email Information</b>
				<p>In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, 
				if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain 
				the content of your email messages together with your email address and 
				our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic 
				communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received 
				by mail and telephone.</p>
			
				<b>2.	Web Site Use Information</b>
				<p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard 
				technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) 
				and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. 
				Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the 
				date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and 
				the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information 
				is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with 
				you as an individual.</p>
			
				<b>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</b>
				<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering 
				our business activities, providing customer service and making available other 
				products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, 
				we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes 
				to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. 
				The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed 
				under our traditional business standards designed to safeguard the security and 
				privacy of our customers’ personal information. As a customer, you will always be 
				given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.</p>
				<p><b>What Are Cookies?</b> Cookies are a feature of Web browser 
				software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. 
				Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the 
				user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one 
				Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user 
				or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. 
				This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete 
				commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience 
				easier and more personalized.</p>
			
				<b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</b>
				<p>We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to 
				gather information about our Web site users’ browsing activities, in order to 
				constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This information 
				assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the user-friendliest manner and 
				to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and 
				prospective customers.</p>
				<p>Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The 
				information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web 
				site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how 
				many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site’s visitor capacity. We do 
				not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally 
				identifying information about you.</p>
			
				<b>Sharing Information with Strategic Partners</b>
				<p>We may enter into strategic alliances or partnerships to provide you with additional 
				shopping cart related services and they may be given access to personal information 
				including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing 
				you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you.  
				In connection with strategic alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership 
				rights to the information, and we will not share information regarding your social 
				security number or other personal financial data. </p>
				
				<b>Notice of New Services and Changes</b>
				<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about 
				important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will 
				find valuable.  As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your 
				desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you receive such 
				an offer or by sending us an email request at 
				<a href="mailto:unsubscribe@pinnaclecart.com">unsubscribe@pinnaclecart.com</a>. 
				</p>
			
				<b>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</b>
				<p>When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Web site, secure 
				server software, which we have licensed, encrypts all information you input before it is sent 
				to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Web site.</p>
				<p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security
				 measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, 
				 we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account 
				 numbers to us through an unsecured email. </p>
			
				<b>How Do We Protect Your Information?</b>
				<p><b>Information Security.</b>  We utilize encryption/security software to 
				safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access 
				or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
				<p><b>Evaluation of Information Protection Practices</b>. Periodically, our 
				operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies 
				and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.</p>
				<p><b>Employee Access, Training and Expectations.</b> Our corporate values, 
				ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer 
				information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential 
				information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, 
				processes and transactions.</p>
			
				<b>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information? </b>
				<p>You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect 
				online and maintain in our database by emailing <a href="mailto:customerservice@pinnaclecart.com">customerservice@pinnaclecart.com</a>.
				</p>
			
				<b>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</b>
				<p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, 
				in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.
				</p>
				
			
				<b>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</b>
				<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from neither 
				our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites 
				are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users 
				of our Web site.</p>
				<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, 
				our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web 
				site, including Web sites, which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site’s 
				own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
				
				<b>Your Consent</b>
				<p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information 
				as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, 
				we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, 
				how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>
