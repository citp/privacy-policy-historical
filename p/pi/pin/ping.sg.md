# Privacy Policy

## Privacy policy

This site is owned and operated by PingDotSG (53105762C) (“Ping.sg”). Ping.sg aims to make your experience online satisfying and secure. This statement governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this web site and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information.

Traditionally, the process goes through 2 stages.

#### Types of Collected Data 

Ping.sg gathers two types of information about this website’s users:

  * Personal information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email, survey information, and online registration forms to Ping.sg. Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, company name, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity.
  * Ping.sg also gathers non-personal information through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This non-personal information collected includes click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data. This non-personal information allows us to better tailor our content to site users’ needs.



#### Usage Tracking

We track product usage data and user traffic patterns throughout our site to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service. In addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to our site from the reports and emails we sent to our customers. This is done to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to discourage fraud.

#### Cookies and Web Beacons

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are required to use the Ping.sg service. We use cookies to record current session information. Additionally, if you choose the “remember me” option, you are issued a permanent cookie. A permanent cookie is one that remains on the hard drive after the browser application has been closed.

We also use third party advertisements on Ping.sg to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out some, but not all, of this ad servings at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

#### Use of Collected Data 

We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. We use the personal information collected to provide you with our products and services. In addition, the personal information collected is used for identification and authentication, billing, and to contact you. Finally, information we gather may be used to otherwise improve our services.

#### Transfer and Information Sharing Policy 

We do not share personal information collected on this web site with third parties for their direct marketing. We provide personal information to trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.

We does not otherwise share personal information about site users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Ping.sg's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others.

If Ping.sg should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information Ping.sg receives from this Site is a Ping.sg asset and may be transferred.
