Pinger processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. We process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners, but only when you have provided your express consent to allow us to do so.</p>

App Data can include: IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system information, unique device identifier (UDID), date/time stamp, clickstream data, messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages, type of device, location information, user age and gender demographics, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier information. “Share Data” is data and information you provide for use with Pinger’s products or services and which may be made available to third parties by your actions when using Pinger products or services which constitute your consent for Pinger’s use of Share Data as so directed by you.</p>

	<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
		<p>Pinger uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the Pinger services by processing such information for various purposes, including improving and providing Pinger’s products and services, product notifications, delivering advertisements and related links, for sending, sharing and storing your Share Data as you direct through use of Pinger products and services, and other purposes relating to offering you Pinger products and services.</p>

	<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information unless we have your express consent and in the following circumstances:</h2>
		<p>(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail, SMS, MMS, and voice communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.</p>

	<br>

		<p>(ii) Pinger may share with third parties App Data and certain aggregated, non-personal information, but such information does not identify you individually.</p>

		<p>(iv) Pinger may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Pinger products, services, computing systems, or website, or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public.</p>

	<br>

	<br>

		<p>(vi) Pinger may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through Pinger products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and privacy policies. You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. If Pinger desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use for those other purposes.</p>
