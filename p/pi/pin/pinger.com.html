"Contact Data" is contact information you've developed that you may provide to Pinger to enhance your use of Pinger's products and services. "Message Data" includes the messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages, and your account activity, such as log-in times and message storage capacity.  "Traffic Data" is anonymous information about the nature of your usage of Pinger's website and products and services and can include:  IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, type of computer or mobile phone, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier information.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
		<p>Pinger uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the Pinger services by processing such information for various purposes, including providing information to you about Pinger's products and services, formatting and displaying elements of Contact Data and Message Data to you and to those whom you send messages, delivering advertisements and related links, storing your messages, and other purposes relating to offering you Pinger products and services.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information unless we have your express consent and in the following circumstances:</h2>
		<p>
		(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail and SMS communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.<br><br>

		(ii)&nbsp; Pinger may share with third parties certain aggregated, non-personal information and Traffic Data, but such information does not identify you individually.<br><br>

		(iii)&nbsp; Pinger does not share any Contact Data or Message Data with any third party, except that certain Contact Data and Message Data, such as a contact name and message subject header, may be included in messages you send using Pinger services.&nbsp; <br><br>

		(v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization.<br><br>

		(vi) Pinger may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through registration from a co-branded version of the Pinger service operated with a third party or through a communication or promotional program of a third party that is enabled by the Pinger service.  Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and privacy policies.  You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto<br><br>
