# Privacy policy | Pinterest Policy

  * Our mission is to help you discover and do what you love. To do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and third parties. We only use that information where we have a proper legal basis for doing so. 

We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. Because we’re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your [questions and comments](https://help.pinterest.com/contact) on this policy.




  * ##  1\. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it 

When you sign up for or use Pinterest, you give us certain information voluntarily. This includes your name, email address, phone number, profile photo, Pins, comments, and any other information you give us. You can also choose to share with us location data or photos. If you buy something on Pinterest, we collect payment information, contact information (address and phone number) and details of what you bought. If you buy something for someone else on Pinterest, we collect their delivery details and contact information.

If you link your Facebook or Google account or accounts from other third party services to Pinterest, we also get information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.  
 

  * ##  2\. We also get technical information when you use Pinterest 

Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you use Pinterest. Here are some of the types of information we collect:

    * **Log data.** When you use Pinterest, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address, the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the “Save” button—more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Pinterest, cookie data and device data. If you’d like, you can [get more details](https://web.archive.org/technical-information-we-collect-when-you-use-our-service) on the types of information we collect in our logs.
    * **Cookie data.**  We also use “cookies” (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser) or similar technologies to capture log data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. For more detailed information about how we use cookies, please review our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies).
    * **Device information.** In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using Pinterest on, including type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.  
 

  * ##  3\. Our partners and advertisers share information with us 

We also get information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with, or other publicly available sources. For example:

    * Some websites or apps use Pinterest features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/personalization-and-data) about these features.
    * Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you. This includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third party service, which we might use to help show you ads. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/personalized-ads-pinterest) about the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us.




  * We use the information we collect to provide the Service to you. We commit to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. In order to do that, it’s necessary for us to use your information to: 

    * Identify you when you use Pinterest, and process your transactions.
    * Recommend Pins, boards, topics or categories you might like based on your activity on Pinterest. For example, if we see you’re into cooking, we may suggest food-related Pins, boards or people that we think you might like or show you food-related ads.
    * Respond to your questions or comments.

In addition and for similar reasons, we have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the Service we provide. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make the Service relevant, interesting and personal to you like we promised, and it’s in both of our interests for us to do that.

We also have a legitimate interest to improve Pinterest, maintain our relationship with you, and protect users. We both benefit when we use your information to: 

    * Suggest other people who have similar interests. For example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like.

    * Help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest, if you agree to this in your settings. For example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we can help your Facebook friends find you on Pinterest when they first sign up for Pinterest. Or, people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email.

    * Conduct analytics on who is using Pinterest and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better.

    * Improve Pinterest and offer new features.

    * Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like saves or comments, happens on Pinterest) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings. For example, we send weekly updates that include Pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting these notifications by [updating your settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/) .

    * Work with law enforcement and keep Pinterest safe. We may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/law-enforcement-guidelines).

We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you in order to generate revenue (providing this Service is expensive!) To further these interests we use the information we collect to: 

    * Decide which ads to show you. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. We customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we will obtain consent where required as described in more detail below. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they have obtained.

    * Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Promoted Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site. In other instances, this information isn’t aggregated. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Promoted Pin has been saved by certain people. To find out more about reporting on Promoted Pins, please [visit the Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/ads-performance-reporting-pinterest).

    * Tell our ad partners the types of products you might be interested in. For example, if you create a board dedicated to sneakers, we can tell a retailer that you’re more interested in sneakers than, say, sweaters. This helps us and our ad partners to make sure that the content and ads you see are relevant to you.

We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your Pinterest experience based on your offsite behavior. For example, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you. When we identify your interests based on your offsite behavior with cookies, we will obtain any consent we may need. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies).

In addition to the specific circumstances above, we’ll only use your information with your consent in order to:

    * Send you marketing materials by email, text or push notification, depending on your account or operating system settings. Each time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe.

    * Identify your location and customize the content we show you. For example, if we know that you are based in San Francisco, we could show you Pins of local products. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.

    * Allow searching with photos. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.

    * Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the Pinterest tag. The Pinterest tag (a piece of code) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on Pinterest. To learn more about the Pinterest tag, please [visit the Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/personalized-ads-pinterest).

We’ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:

    * Identify you across different browser sessions. This means if you log into Pinterest from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit Pinterest.

    * Show you ads you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite behavior. We do this for existing users and for new users, and it helps us customize the new user experience.

To find out more about how we use cookies, and your choices about how we use them, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180623210226id_/https://policy.pinterest.com/en/cookies).




  * Pinterest is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.

For all transfers of your information from the EEA to the US, Pinterest is certified under Privacy Shield and follows its principles. [Learn more](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list) about Privacy Shield and the principles.

Where we share information we receive under Privacy Shield with third parties, we're responsible for making sure those third parties also comply with Privacy Shield, unless we can prove we're not responsible for the damaging event.

If you are a user in the EEA and have a question or a complaint about Pinterest and Privacy Shield, please [contact us](https://help.pinterest.com/contact). If we're not able to resolve the issue, Pinterest will cooperate with the JAMS Arbitration and Mediation Service. This provides an independent dispute resolution service for Privacy Shield complaints in the US. In certain circumstances, and if the dispute resolution process still doesn’t resolve the problem, users in the EEA may pursue binding arbitration. Pinterest is also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

Where we transfer information from the EEA to a country that doesn't provide an adequate level of protection, we’ll only do so under appropriate safeguards to protect your information, like standard contractual clauses, or Privacy Shield certification.




  * Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a Pinterest account, many of the choices you have on Pinterest are built directly into Pinterest or your settings. For example, you can:

    * Edit information in [your profile](https://www.pinterest.com/me/) at any time, decide whether your profile is available to search engines, or choose whether others can find your Pinterest account using your email address.

    * Link or unlink your Pinterest account from other services (like Facebook, Google or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also decide whether or not to publish your Pinterest activity to that service.

    * Create or be added to a secret board. Secret boards are visible to you and other collaborators in the board, and any collaborator may choose to make the board available to anyone else. For example, another collaborator can invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends. For more information about secret boards, please [visit our Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/all-about-boards).

    * Choose whether Pinterest will be customized for you using information from other websites or apps. If you have a Pinterest account and want to control how your offsite data is used to tailor your experience, you can visit [your settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/) and update your “Personalization” preferences. If you don’t have a Pinterest account or don’t want us to customize Pinterest for you when you’re signed out, you can [opt out](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/personalization-and-data).

    * Choose whether your purchases on Pinterest will be used to customize recommendations and ads for you. You can view and manage your purchase history by going to “Order history” in [your settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/) and if you hide a purchase from your history, we won’t use it to customize Pinterest for you.

    * Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we’ll deactivate it and remove your Pins and boards from Pinterest.

Also, we support the Do Not Track browser setting and you can [learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/we-support-do-not-track) about how it affects our collection and use of offsite data.

In addition to the examples provided above, we offer other choices that you can learn more about in our [Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/).

You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest. For example:

    * The browser you use lets you control cookies or other types of local data storage.

    * Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your location, photos, advertising identifiers and other data is shared with us.

To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by your device or software provider.




  * Anyone can see the public boards and Pins you create and the profile information you give us. We also make this public information available through what are called APIs (basically a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. Some of the ways we use your information require us to share information with third parties, so we can provide your Pinterest experience, make sure our customization is effective and comply with laws that apply to us. We share your information with:

    * Other services (like Facebook or Google) when you decide to link your Pinterest account to those services or publish your activity on Pinterest to them. For example, you can choose to publish your Pins to Facebook or Twitter.

    * Merchants you purchase from on Pinterest. When you buy something on Pinterest using your payment card, we share information necessary for you to make your purchase, such as your payment card information, contact information, and other information about the transaction with the merchant you’re buying from. For example, if you buy something on Pinterest using Apple Pay, your card number isn’t shared with the merchant, but we still share contact and transaction information. We share this information because it’s necessary to make the purchase. The merchants treat this information in the same way as if you had made a purchase from their website directly, which means that their privacy policies and marketing policies apply to the information we share with them. For more information on what we share with merchants, [see our Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/seller-privacy-policies).

    * Online advertisers and third party companies that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps (for example, through Google Analytics). This includes what Pins or ads you were shown on Pinterest and whether or how you engaged with those Pins or ads, or other information about your activity on Pinterest. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/personalized-ads-pinterest) about how we share information with online advertisers. To learn more about third party companies that analyze ad performance, please [see our Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/third-party-analytics-or-advertising-providers-pinterest-uses-or-allows).

    * Third party companies or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we share payment card information with the payment companies we use to store your payment information. We also share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. 

    * Law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

    * Our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganisation, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).




  * We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you. 




  * Children under 13 are not allowed to use Pinterest. If you are based in the EEA you may only use Pinterest if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country or if verifiable parental consent for your use of Pinterest has been provided to us. If you are a parent and you learn that your child is using Pinterest and you don't want them to, [please contact us](https://help.pinterest.com/contact).




  * You have options in relation to the information that we have about you described below. To exercise these options, please [contact us](https://help.pinterest.com/contact). If you're an EEA user, you can:

    * Access the information we hold about you. We'll usually share this with you within 30 days of you asking us for it.

    * Have your information corrected or deleted. You can update your information in your settings. If you have problems updating the information or if you would like us to delete it, [contact us](https://help.pinterest.com/contact).

    * Object to us processing your information. You can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your information to send you marketing emails or push notifications. If you opt out of receiving marketing messages from us, we may still send you newsletters and updates about your account, such as when another user comments on one of your Pins. We only send you marketing material if you've agreed to it, but if you'd rather we don't, you can easily [unsubscribe at any time](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/notifications#Web).

    * Have the information you provided to us sent to another organization, where we hold this information with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, where it's technically feasible.

    * Complain to a regulator. If you're based in the EEA and think that we haven't complied with data protection laws, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the [Data Protection Commission in Ireland](https://dataprotection.ie/) or with your local supervisory authority.




  * We may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Pinterest after those changes are in effect, you agree to the new policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or get your consent, as required by law.




  * The best way to get in touch is through the [Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/contact). If you live in the United States, Pinterest, Inc. is responsible for your information. You can contact Pinterest Inc. at 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.

If you live outside the United States, the data controller you should contact is Pinterest Europe Ltd., an Irish company with its registered office at Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.

You can also contact our [Data Protection Officer](https://help.pinterest.com/data-protection-officer-contact-form).
