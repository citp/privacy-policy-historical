<img src="_Img/headers_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy Policy" width="750" height="60" border="0"><br>
This Privacy Policy (referred to as this "Policy") discloses the privacy practices for Pinnacle Health  (referred to as "us" or "we") with respect to its pinhealth.com Web site and various related services (together referred to as the "Site"). 
As a provider of medical content, we understand the sensitive nature of each communication and transaction that we have with you. As such, we give you the power to determine how much information you provide us, as well as the ability to cancel your relationship with us at any time.
<p>
You acknowledge that this Policy is part of our Site Terms and Conditions of Use, and by accessing or using our Site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions.  If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this Site.  
</p><p>
We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time.  Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to issuing an email to the email address listed by registered users and posting the revised Policy on this page.  You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid email address as a registered user, review this Site and this Policy periodically and be aware of any modifications.  Your continued use of the Site after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy.
</p><p>
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information users reveal to us outside of the Site via e-mail or by other methods. Any information that is provided as part of normal patient-physician communications is governed by applicable patient confidentiality law. 
</p><p>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
Pinnacle Health is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any third party in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Information is collected from our users at several different points on our Site.
</p><p>
We may collect information from users including personal profile information as well as personal interest information. This includes name, address, e-mail address, zip code, gender, date of birth, health/fitness interests, current exercise or activity programs, age (range), and password. We do not collect financial information on the profile.
</p><p>
Additionally, we will from time-to-time collect information in surveys and questionnaires via e-mails or forms. Participation in these surveys or completion of a form is completely voluntary and each user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level), and in the case of practice surveys, the information may be medical information. Medical information will be used by the practice for follow-up care and outcomes assessment and is considered to be part of normal patient-physician communications and is governed by applicable patient confidentiality law. 
</p><p>
<b>Registration</b><br>
In order to have a more personalized experience on this Site, a user may elect to complete the online registration form to create a user profile. During registration, a user is required to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our Site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as gender) and personal interest information (such as preferred sports). However, we encourage each user to provide such information so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Site. During the registration process, we will also ask users for permission to send them information such as newsletters, online surveys and assessments, and product information (some of which will come from other parties).
</p><p>
<b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
A user may correct or update user profile information at any time by accessing the profile page and providing the personal password that was set at registration. However, a user cannot change or delete their user-id, unless they make a request to the us.
</p><p>
You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by writing us as:  Pinnacle Health, 33 Boston Post Road West, Suite 270 · Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752
</p><p>
Please include your name, address, and/or email address when you contact us.
</p><p>
We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes.  You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Site.  In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups. 
</p><p>
<b>Disclosure Of Information</b><br>
Unless otherwise identified in this paragraph, we will not disclose, without a user's prior consent, any medical or other identifiable information gathered from our users on this site that could be used to identify or contact our users (personal information). In limited circumstances, we may release personal information to third parties (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order, or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to our users or others. We do have third party relationships with vendors that operate and maintain our Site, that may result in them having access to user information. We require that each of our vendors not use or disclose user information beyond what is reasonably necessary to perform the functions and operations on behalf of Pinnacle Health. Third-party vendors are forbidden from disclosing a user's personal information to other entities without authorization from us and/or the user. 
</p><p>
We may share aggregate information with other third parties. For example, we might share information regarding the number of users of our Site and the type of activities they conduct while using our Site. We would potentially share composite demographic information about our users as a whole, but not personal information that can identify any user. Depending upon the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this information.
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing user session information. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Site, but this information does allow us to dynamically generate content on web pages specifically for the user. We may use information provided by users to create a personalized user experience. Other sites that users might link to from our Site may also use cookies when a user accesses their site. We are unable to control their use of cookies or how they manage the information they gather. We have no control over, nor have we endorsed their privacy policies. 
</p><p> 
<b>Links On Our Site</b><br>
This Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.
</p><p>
<b>Security</b><br>
Our Site takes every precaution to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of users information under our control. Information provided during the registration process is password-protected. Our Site is hosted by a third party organization that uses  encryption to protect sensitive information online. The servers that are used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, no date transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
</p><p>
If a user has any concerns regarding the security of information, the user should not provide any information until the user is comfortable with our security measures.
