        <p><b>We take your right to privacy seriously and want you to feel comfortable 
          using our web site. This Privacy Policy deals with personally identifiable 
          information that may be collected by us on our site. This Policy does 
          not apply to other entities that we do not own or control or persons 
          that are not our employees, agents or within our control. Our Privacy 
          Policy is as follows: </b></p>
        <p><b>1. Collection of Data.<br>
          Our registration process requires only a valid e-mail address and a 
          unique user ID and password. Providing us with other information is 
          at your option. Please take note that your user name, e-mail address, 
          or other submissions that you make on this site may contain your real 
          name or other personally identifiable information and, as a result, 
          may appear on this site. Like many web sites, we may also automatically 
          receive general information that is contained in our server log files 
          such as your IP address and cookie information. Information about how 
          advertising may be served on this site is set forth below.</b></p>
        <p><b>2. Use of Data.<br>
          We may use personal information to customize and improve your user experience 
          on this site. We will make efforts so that your personal information 
          will not be provided to third parties. In the event you choose to use 
          links that appear on our site to visit other web sites, you are advised 
          to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites.</b></p>
        <p><b>3. Cookies.<br>
          Like many web sites, we set and use cookies to enhance your user experience, 
          such as retaining your personal settings. </b></p>
        <p><b>4. Editing or Deleting Your Account Information.<br>
          We provide you with the ability to edit the information in your user 
          account information that you provided to us in registration. You may 
          request deletion of your user account by contacting us. Content or other 
          data that you may have provided to us and that is not contained within 
          your user account, such as posts that may appear within our forums, 
          may continue to remain on our site at our discretion even though your 
          user account is deleted. </b></p>
        <p><b>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy.<br>
          We may make changes to this Policy from time to time. We will notify 
          you of substantial changes to this Policy either by posting a prominent 
          announcement on our site and/or by sending a message to the e-mail address 
          you have provided to us that is contained within your user settings.</b></p>
        <p><b>6. NO GUARANTEES.<br>
          While this Privacy Policy states our standards for maintenance of personal 
          information and we will make efforts to meet them, we are not in a position 
          to guarantee these standards. There may be factors beyond our control 
          that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, we disclaim 
          any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure 
          of personal information.</b></p>
