										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Through your use of Mobile Apps:</b>

											diagnose server problems, administering the Property and determining your approximate geographic location.

										<li>
											<b>Using cookies: </b>

											the Property users, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about the Property usage and response rates.
										</li>

										<li>
											If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure on most devices through which the Properties are

										<li>
											If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Property, you can adjust the
											settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also

											instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia
											site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that
											are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of
											Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the
											Property or our content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we
											cannot guarantee that they will do so.

										<li>
											<b>Geographic location information:</b>

										</li>
										<li>
