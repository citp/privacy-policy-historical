# Privacy Policy - Pinkberry

Effective August 2017

## The Pinkberry Franchise System

The Pinkberry franchise system is a restaurant network made up of company-operated, franchised, and licensed Pinkberry restaurant businesses. Pinkberry franchisees (“Franchised Operators” or “Operators”) own and operate their own individual franchised businesses. Pinkberry licensees (“Licensees”) are granted a license to use Pinkberry’s trade name and marks in the sale of Pinkberry products at Pinkberry licensed locations. Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee, or to any Pinkberry operations outside of the United States. Please see the Franchised Operator and Licensee Online Services section below for more information regarding a Franchised Operator’s or Licensee’s applicable policies.

## Information Covered by This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to information, including Personal Information, collected about you by Pinkberry and its third-party service providers. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that personally identifies you.

## Information Collected Automatically

We and our third-party service providers use tracking technologies such as Traffic Data, Cookies, Web Beacons, and others to automatically collect certain information from you when you use Pinkberry U.S. Online Services.

We also use cookies, which are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and allow websites to remember information about users (“Cookies”). We use Cookies to monitor how Pinkberry U.S. Online Services are used, for marketing purposes, and to help personalize and improve Pinkberry U.S. Online Services. Most browsers automatically accept Cookies. You have the choice to set your browser to accept or reject Cookies.

Certain pages on Pinkberry U.S. Online Services and Social Media Pages may contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs), which are small bits of code embedded in pages or images on Pinkberry U.S. Online Services and Social Media Pages (“Web Beacons”).

We and our third-party service providers may also utilize other tracking technologies. For example, if permitted by applicable law, we may collect “referrers” and various environmental variables. A “referrer” is information the web browser passes along to our or our third-party service provider web servers, which refers to the URL from which you accessed Pinkberry U.S. Online Services. Environmental variables may include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed Pinkberry U.S. Online Services or Social Media Pages, the type of web browsers and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the website you left to visit Pinkberry U.S. Online Services or Social Media Pages, the names of the web pages you visit, and the Internet address of the website you visit next. These environmental variables are collected by many websites. We use these technologies for marketing purposes and to optimize user’s experience with Pinkberry U.S. Online Services.

We treat information automatically collected as non-personally identifying information. Such information may be combined with your Personal Information so that we can improve and customize Pinkberry U.S. Online Services and our communications and Promotions. To the extent that information automatically collected is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
