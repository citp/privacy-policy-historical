** Children's Online Privacy Protection Act**  
  
PinkMonkey.com is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which became effective April 21, 2000.

 **In compliance with the Childrens Online Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. section 6501 - 6506 and 16 C.F.R.312.1-312.12, this site does not permit children under 13 years of age to become users. If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to access the site.**

PinkMonkey.com is also in compliance with the initiative and spirit of the guidelines set forth by the [Children's Advertising Review Unit](http://www.caru.org/) (CARU). We have made appropriate changes to our site to ensure compliance even though this is a voluntary action. We considered it a primary goal to remain a "G" rated site. We make every attempt to exclude content that is adult in language or content or contains sexual innuendo. Other teen and student targeted sites view this type of material as an attraction and we do not want to be included in that group. If you find objectionable material on this site or on a site for which we have provided an external link, please let us know [support@pinkmonkey.com](mailto:support@pinkmonkey.com).

**Access to the Internet:** The PinkMonkey.com website is only available to persons with access to the Internet. To reach the site, you must have the proper equipment and connecting devices. The overall Internet contains websites containing material which is not appropriate for all viewers, particularly minors. PinkMonkey recommends that each parent take responsibility for the activity of their children to install effective filtering/blocking mechanisms on each computer a child may access to protect your children from inappropriate content. If you install an effective means of filtering/blocking on each computer, you greatly reduce the ability of your children to access inappropriate content.
