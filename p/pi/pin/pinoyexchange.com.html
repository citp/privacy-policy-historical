This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site.
</p>
<p>
We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Information Collection And Use</h2>
<p>
While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you.
Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to name, email address, username, facebook photo, and contact number for the purpose of moderating your participation in the forum and for processing promo-related activities including promo claims within the site.
</p>
<p>
We may occasionally contact you to obtain feedback on the forum to improve user experience which may include data on your usage habits, preferences and other demographic details such as gender, age among other things.
As part of using our platform, we may have to share your contact information with third parties in order to improve your use of our online platform.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Information Shared With Third Parties</h2>
<p>
In addition, as a necessary part of providing the Services, we may disclose information collected from you to certain third parties.
For example, we may disclose certain Personal Information about you to our third-party service providers (e.g., our third party website service providers), so long as they are only using the Personal Information to provide services to us.
We may also share your information to Advertisers for processing promo-related activities.
</p>
<p>
If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
Under certain limited circumstances, we may cooperate with legal investigations and/or we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose information collected through the Site or the Services,
such as, by way of example, to a court or a governmental agency, and our policy is to provide such cooperation and comply fully with all such legal requirements.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Log Data</h2>
<p>
Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data").
</p>
<p>
This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze the collected data.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Communications</h2>
<p>
For those who have submitted their forms with us or for those who sent in queries, we may use your Personal Information to contact you for any marketing or promotional materials.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Cookies</h2>
<p>
Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive.
</p>
<p>
Like many sites, we use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Site.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Security</h2>
<p>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Data retention</h2>
<p>
We retain information you provide to us and which we collect about you, including Personal Information and Personal Data,

</p>
<h2 class="content-header tertiary">Data transfers</h2>
<p>
PEX's corporate headquarter is located in Philippines, and so your information may be transferred to, and/or stored in, Philippines.
In addition, we sometimes transfer or disclose information to third parties including to persons and businesses outside Philippines including in the United States of America, and Canada.
</p>
<p>
These transfers are made in order to assist us to provide you with the products and services, and/or to improve the products and services we offer you.
Where we transfer information to persons outside of Philippines, that information will be treated according to similar (but not lesser) standards imposed by the requirements of the Privacy Act (and where appropriate the GDPR) in relation to that information by PEX's entry into binding contractual arrangements with such third parties.
