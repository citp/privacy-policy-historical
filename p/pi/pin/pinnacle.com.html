<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Pinnacle (otherwise referred to herein as "we" or "us") adheres to the Personal Data Protection Act of Curacao (2013) and the EU Electronic Communications Privacy Directive (EC Directive/2002/58/EC as amended by the Directive 2009/136/EC) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) can be contacted at dpo@pinnacle.com.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy please contact the DPO.

<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">Changes to the privacy notice and your duty to inform us of changes</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph"><this version="" was="" last="" updated="" on="" may="" 24="" 2018="" and="" historic="" versions="" can="" be="" obtained="" by="" contacting="" the="" dpo="" div="">
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">This version was last updated on May 24, 2018 and historic versions can be obtained by contacting the DPO.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</div>
</this></div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">1. How we use your data</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via email, phone, post or text message, if and when applicable. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@pinnacle.com">customerservice@pinnacle.com</a>.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">By providing your personal information and registering with us or logging on with us when you enter our Website, you explicitly consent to us processing and disclosing your personal information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise provided in accordance with the Terms &amp; Conditions.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">Third-party links</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">2. The data we collect about you</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Personal data (or personal information) means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Identity Data</b> includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, date of birth and gender.</li>
<li><b>Contact Data</b> includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.</li>

</ul>
</div>

Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">On rare occasions, we may collect health data from you when you forward us specific medical reports. Outside this scenario, we do not collect any special categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your genetic and biometric data). For the avoidance of doubt, data pertaining to self-exclusion requests are not considered to be data related to health.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">If you fail to provide personal data</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or provide you with the service requested.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Please note that any information which you transmit to us by email is not encrypted and is transmitted at your own risk.</div>

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">a. For anti-money laundering, fraud detection and/or control purposes, Pinnacle has the right to transfer your personal data to third parties, including but not limited to third-party suppliers such as the police, financial integrity units, banks, ID and address verification system providers, payment service providers and financial institutions, however, only where we have assurance that they are meeting the same standards on the processing of data and security. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of our third-party suppliers.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">b. Furthermore, we reserve the right to disclose your personal data to relevant third parties, such as other Pinnacle group companies, our regulators, financial integrity units, notably when Pinnacle has reasonable grounds to suspect irregularities involving your account.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">c. Your data will also be shared for regular operational purposes with entities such as cloud services, data centres, payment services, banks, ID verification tools, customer communication tools, game suppliers etc.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">d. We are entitled to share the information we hold on you which includes personal data and/or betting history with sporting bodies in order to investigate fraud, money laundering or sports integrity issues and to comply with our regulatory duties.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">e. Some of the data processors engaged to process your personal data may be based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) where data protection laws are not as protective as EU law. In such cases the information will continue to be subject to one or more appropriate safeguards set out in the law. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and is processed with appropriate care and protection and in line with applicable legal requirements.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">5. How long we keep your information</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">In order to comply with our legal, financial and regulatory requirements we will maintain your information for the minimum length of time required to meet those requirements.

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">If there has been no Account Activity (as defined in our <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/termsandconditions">Terms and Conditions</a>) and we have maintained your data for the minimum time required to meet our legal and regulatory requirements, your account will be closed and pseudonymised.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Accounts where there has been an instance of fraud, notification of gambling addiction and/or permanent self-exclusion, will not be anonymised so that we may continue to monitor these customers in adherence to our legal and regulatory requirements.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">6. Keeping you informed about our products and services</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">We’d love to send you offers, competitions &amp; exclusive content through our various marketing channels.

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Subject to certain limitations on certain rights you have the following rights in relation to your information. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting <a href="mailto:customerservice@pinnacle.com">customerservice@pinnacle.com</a> naming the right you are exercising along with the reason for your request, if applicable.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph"><b>Right of Access:</b> you have the right to request access to your personal data and supplementary information.</div>

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph"><b>Right to Erasure:</b> you have the right to request erasure of your information where there is no longer a good reason for us to continue processing it. Please ensure that you withdraw your Account Balance prior to sending us the request. The rules enacted under the section 8 of our <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/termsandconditions">Terms and Conditions</a> related to the Withdrawal of funds apply. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. It should be noted that this right is not absolute and may be subject to our compelling reasons to maintain that information such as our adherence to legal and regulatory obligations. Please see the section “How long we keep your information” above. In the event we are unable to comply with this request you will be notified.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph"><b>Right to Restrict Processing:</b> this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful (i.e. where it does not fall under a legal reason for processing as outlined under section 3. or your information has otherwise been obtained illegally by a third party) but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph"><b>Right to Data Portability:</b> you have the right to request the personal data you have provided to us. You may make a data portability request by contacting <a href="mailto:customerservice@pinnacle.com">customerservice@pinnacle.com</a>.</div>

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">It should be noted that the ability to perform our services relies on the processing of certain information, therefore, exercising certain rights may result in a loss of the service or part of it.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">No fee usually required</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-section-title">What we may need from you</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In the event you did not provide all your verification information upon registering with us, this information may be requested to complete your profile. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph"><b>What is a web cookie?</b></div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Cookies are text files containing a small amount of information that are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. They are generally used by most websites to improve your online experience and to ensure that content and functions are delivered and used more effectively.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Cookies perform various different functions. For example, some cookies are downloaded to your device temporarily for the period that you browse a particular website; these cookies might allow you to navigate between pages more efficiently or enable websites to remember the preferences you select. Other cookies can be used to help websites remember you as a returning visitor or ensure the online adverts you receive are more relevant to your specific needs and interests.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">You can amend your browser settings to block some or all cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser provider. Please be aware, if you block cookies from Pinnacle’s website some or all the website's functions may not perform as intended.</div>
<div class="privacy-policy-paragraph">For example, you may not actually be able to place any bets. If you would like to amend your browser settings see “manage your cookies”. If you would like more information about cookies see “further information”.</div>
