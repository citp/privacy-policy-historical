											<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
											<p>We at Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. (PDSi) are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (Personal Information) you share with us.</p>
											<p>PDSi has developed this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
											<p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address, an e-mail address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit PDSi's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.</p>
											<p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that information, within PDSi or to PDSi's third party service providers.</p>
											<h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
											<p>Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.</p>
											<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site.</p>
											<p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.</p>
											<p>To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:</p>
											<h3>Notice</h3>
											<p>Where PDSi collects Personal Information on the Web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information is collected and whether we plan to share such Personal Information outside of PDSi or with those working on PDSi's behalf. PDSi does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not acting on PDSi's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. PDSi will take reasonable steps to ensure third parties acting on PDSi's behalf are obligated to protect Personal Information in the same manner as PDSi agrees to protect Personal Information.</p>
											<h3>Choice</h3>
											<p>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to PDSi. The notice we intend to provide on the Web site where PDSi collects Personal Information should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of PDSi's Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services that involve our interaction with you.</p>
											<h3>Correct/Update Personal Information</h3>
											<p>PDSi wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide you with a means of contacting PDSi should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to privacyonline@pinnacle.com, and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable.</p>
											<h3>Security</h3>
											<p>Wherever your Personal Information may be held by PDSi or by those acting on PDSi's behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
											<h3>Children's Guidelines</h3>
											<p>We do not collect, use or disclose any online contact information or identifiable off-line contact information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. The PDSi Web site is not directed to children.</p>
											<h3>Your Consent</h3>
											<p>By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to PDSi's processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above as well as those explained where PDSi collects Personal Information on the Web. Should the Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes prominently on our Web site for a reasonable period of time.</p>
											<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
											<p>The PDSi Web site contains links to other Web sites. PDSi is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites.</p>

We are also committed to complying with requirements of other applicable current or future environmental laws, where PDSi does business.

										<p>Labeling is not required by the RoHS Directive and no industry or regulatory standard for RoHS labeling exists. Currently, PDSi does not intend to label products as RoHS-compliant.</p>
										<p>PDSi's RoHS compliance planning is based on conformance to the RoHS Directive issued by the EU, and not on any specific Member State legislation or legislation from any other countries. As other environmental regulations are passed by the U.S. or other countries in which PDSi does business, PDSi's compliance planning will respond accordingly.</p>
