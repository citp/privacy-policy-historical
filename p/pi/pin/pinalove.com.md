Privacy Policy

We are committed to keeping secure the privacy of our members details.

This privacy policy applies to our websites and apps.

**Best Practices for Privacy and Safety**

  * **Use a unique password when registering for the site**. The password should be at least 8 characters long and not be a dictionary word or name. Using a password manager may be helpful providing it is trustworthy
  * **Do not use your real full name or address anywhere on the site** including your username, in your profile, or in any message you send to another user.
  * **Do use your real and valid email**. If you use a fake or temporary email we may have no means to verify that you are the owner of the profile should you lose access and want to delete it.
  * **Do not put your contact details on your profile** \- it is easy for the details to be farmed by spammers in this way. Only give contact details to other members after you have talked to them for a while and are comfortable doing so
  * **Do not show any private pieces of data in photos you upload**. This includes photos of your home or your office. Especially important is not to upload photos of children (which is also against our terms of use)
  * **If you plan to meet any member from this site it is recommended that you meet them in a public place such as a busy restaurant or mall and that you bring a friend.**
  * **Do not for any reason ever send money to any person on this site**. If anyone ever asks for money either innocently (eg. to help pay their personal expenses) or in a suspicious way (eg. to help pay for hospital bills for a sick relative) DO NOT send any money and immediately report their profile using the report profile functionality so we can protect other members

**Data sharing**

To be able to provide you a service companies other than ourselves may be employed to process or store your data. We endeavour to share only what is necessary to provide service and for legal purposes. We use hosting providers to host our website and database as well as to provide notifications and other functionality. We employ moderation and phone verification providers to protect our site from criminal activity, fraud and abuse and ensure our terms of service are being followed. We may share your data where we are compelled to do so such as a court order. **Third party data collection and tracking**

* Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this website.  
* You have the option to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).  
Alternatively you can opt out - opt out of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Google Analytics is used to track anonymous user data such as browser resolution, access times, and which pages have been accessed. This helps us develop our site to provide more relevant content for our users

**Data security**  
We respect your personal information with the highest regard. Our services are regularly penetration tested and kept up to date with the latest software and operating system patches. We comply with standard security procedures such as password hashing and our site and apps are only available over an encrypted connection. New security vunerabilities are found in underlying software and operating systems daily and no matter how large an organization it is unreasonable to expect data posted online to remain 100% secure and it is always vunerable to loss or theft. For example another provider may be compromised and you used the same password and email as on this site. This would allow anyone with access to that data to access your information here without any fault of this organization. We recommend you use a unique password for each website for this reason. Profiles are not indexed by search engines and although an account is needed to log in and view profiles it is trivial for someone to create an account and then see your photos and profile information so this site an app should be considered public domain. Please do not submit any information that you are not comfortable sharing with strangers.

**Cookies and tracking**  
Cookies: traditional web cookies, local storage objects, tracking pixels, and other technologies are employed to ensure the security of your account and provide functionality. For example your browser saves a cookie that removes the requirement to log in with a username and password each visit. They are also used to ensure your account is secure to help block unauthorised log in attempts or to protect against multiple duplicate accounts (spam/abuse). Third party cookies from other services are also stored in order to help with site development and provide new services. You can disable cookies and tracking in your browser or with separate software however it will impact your experience of our service.

**Acceptance of agreements**  
Your continued use of this website/app indicates your acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to either our Privacy Policy or Terms and Conditions then you may delete any information we hold on you by using our **[Data Removal Tool](https://web.archive.org/deletedata/)**.

We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time so please visit this page regularly.
