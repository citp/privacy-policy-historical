**How We Use It.**

We are part of Pinnacle Systems, Inc., which is based in the United States. In order to manage the information you give to us, we will transfer your information for storage and processing purposes to servers located in the United States--but only to be used in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

Pinnacle does not rent or sell any user-provided personally-identifiable information to third parties. If we plan to share personally-identifiable information with another company, we will inform you at the time we ask for the information. Pinnacle does not share user-provided personally-identifiable information with third parties if the user has opted not to receive information from other third parties or not to allow such disclosure. Pinnacle does not share any demographic information in a way that is personally identifiable. Pinnacle uses the data collected through cookies in aggregate form only and does not collect any personally identifiable information through cookies.

Pinnacle may share your information with its third party service providers. We require our third party service providers to use your information in accordance with this privacy statement and to disclose your information only to their service providers. 

Pinnacle may disclose your personal information if necessary, in Pinnacle's good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant or order or to protect the rights of Pinnacle or others. 

Pinnacle protects users' personal information by storing the information in a controlled, secure environment. Pinnacle occasionally hires other companies to provide services on our behalf, including order fulfillment, rebate administration, and returns management. Pinnacle only provides those companies with the information they require to deliver the service and they are not permitted to use the information for any other purpose without your permission.

**Your Options.**

When you provide contact information and you do not opt out of receiving information from Pinnacle, Pinnacle and its representatives and affiliates may use such information to inform you of product updates and upgrades, special offers, new services and products, and other Pinnacle information. If you do not want Pinnacle or Pinnacle's affiliates to contact you, you may "opt out" at any time. Our emails and newsletters contain instructions for unsubscribing or opting out. You may also elect to "opt in" at a later point if you would like to have Pinnacle or its affiliates contact you. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you will still be able to view most Pinnacle websites, but you will not be able to access areas that require personal identification.

If you participate in our web forums, please remember that any information you disclose in a posting will become public information.
