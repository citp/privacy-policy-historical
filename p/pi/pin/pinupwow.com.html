                <p>                  Although we will attempt to notify you when major  changes are made to this Privacy Policy via email or the Site News section, you  should periodically review the most up-to-date version.

                <p> <strong>Personal Information Collected</strong></p>
                <p>                  We may collect, use or store the following types of  personal information: <br>

                <p> <strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
                <p>Information collected when registering as a Member  on the Site may be used for all the purposes set out within this Privacy Policy  or any further purposes which may be specified throughout the Site. <br>
                  In particular, your Personal Information may be  used for the following purposes:<br>
                  a) To enable us to improve the site design,  navigation, settings and overall experience of the Site by monitoring and  evaluating how the Site is used and interacted with. <br>
                  b) We may monitor the geographical location of our  Users and the Inbound links they have used to originally visit the Site, in  order to monitor where website traffic is coming from and to evaluate the  success of any promotions or work done which was intended to increase traffic. <br>
                  c) We may use information related to your browsing  history on the Site, including but not limited to the types of pages visited  and how frequent, the photos and videos downloaded or viewed, forum posts,  messages to us or other users, length of time on each page and the types of  services and features used.<br>
                  d) Google Analytics is used on our Site to enable  us to monitor information related to your browsing history and navigation  through the Site. Please see our ‘Cookies’ section below for further details.<br>
  e) Private Information which is provided when  registering on the Site, such as First name, Last name, Age (over 18), are  treated confidentially and are never shared with other users of the Site or  unauthorised 3rd parties. Please see 'Protection and Use of Private  Information' below for further information on how this information might be used. <br>
                  f) To enable us to monitor the behaviour of Users  and to properly ensure that the Site is being used responsibly, legally,  appropriately and within the site's standard Terms of Service.</p>
                <p><strong>Age</strong></p>
                <p>                  g) We request that all new Users confirm that they  are eligible and legally permitted to Register on to the Site by being 18 years  old and above in accordance with our Terms of Service.</p>
                <p><strong>Email Address</strong></p>
                <p>h) We will never share your email address (or any  other identifiable personal information) with Unauthorised 3rd parties, such as  a mailing list or direct marketing company. <br>
                  i) When you Register you are automatically included  in our Mailing List for Newsletters and Updates relating to the Site. You can  opt-out of receiving these emails at any time by following the ‘Unsubscribe’  from one of the emails. Once removed from our mailing list you will no longer  receive newsletters or updates related to the Site. You may however, very  rarely, receive emails of highly significant importance, either related to your  account or highly significant news related to us, our company or the Site.<br>
                  j) We will send you an email when you Register in  order to verify that you are the actual owner of the email address provided.  This helps to prevent people from registering multiple accounts too easily or  operating spamming practices.<br>
                  k) Your email address will also be used to send you  your password if you request to have it sent through our 'Forgotten password'  procedure. <br>
                  l) We reserve the right to license email addresses  only to authorised and approved 3rd parties, provided that you have opted-in to  receive newsletters.Â&nbsp; We will never  license email addresses for users that have opted-out of receiving  newsletters.Â&nbsp; You can opt-out at any  time.</p>
                <p><strong>Protection and Use of Confidential and Private Information</strong></p>
                <p>During the Registration Process we request various  forms of Private information such as Name, Email Address, Age (over 18). This  information is always treated as confidential and is never shared with other  any other users on the Site, nor is any information available to persons  outside the immediate group of trusted employees or agents operating the Site.  Such trusted employees or agents will only very rarely ever need to access such  Information, for reasons in accordance with this Privacy Policy or to the  extent required by law, and such access would always be made under strictly  confidential conditions. <br>
                  a) No Private Information will ever be utilised for  direct marketing or profit purposes by selling, exchanging or through agreement  with any unauthorised 3rd party and we would always be sure to receive such  User’s authorisation and confirmation before using any Private Information for  these purposes.<br>
                  b) Private Information may, however, be collated in  order to collect and store statistics or overall data related to the use of the  Site and to our Registered Users (eg We may wish to measure how many users are  based in a certain country or calculate the average age of all the users on the  site). As well as being used for our own strategic purposes, such data may be  shared or exchanged with 3rd parties, however it will always be presented in a  way that individual users are not identifiable and any possibly exploitable  personal information is not displayed. <br>
                  c) We reserve the right to notify any relevant Protective  or Governmental authorities (eg Police) using any provided Private Information  if we suspect or determine, in our own discretion, that a User may have or  there is a significant risk that a User has, engaged in actions relating to or  in the course of using the Site or associated services that may be illegal or  potentially harmful to themselves or others. We will always disclose any  Private Information required to any Relevant Protective Authority when  requested to do so to the extent required by law. <br>
                  d) We will take all reasonable technical and  organisational precautions to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of  any of the Personal Information we gather through the Site and we will only  ever store Private Information that we gather on our secure (Password &amp;  Firewall-Protected) Servers. Note however; Data transmission over the web is  inherently insecure so we can never completely guarantee the security of any  data sent to our Servers. <br>
                  e) You are responsible for keeping your password  and User Account details confidential. Only when signing in to the Site will we  ever request your password from you and all Users' passwords are stored on our  Servers in a securely-encrypted and indecipherable format.</p>
                <p><strong>Information posted on the Site</strong></p>
                <p>We can in no way prevent the use or misuse of any  Information which is posted, submitted or displayed by our Users in the course  of using or visiting the Site and are under no obligation to remove any  personal or confidential data which may be shared or published by Users. We  will where possible however try to remove any content displayed in relation to  the Site that might be considered confidential or private where such  information is reported to us.</p>
                <p><strong>Cookies Policy</strong></p>
                <p>A cookie is information which is sent to your web  browser from our server and is stored there - either for the duration only of  your visit to the Site (using "Session Cookies") or for a fixed  period of time (using "Persistent Cookies") - in order to send  communication and information from your browser to our Server, or indeed to the  server of any other 3rd party who may send you cookies. Such communication  between Browser and Server enables a web server to identify, analyse, track or  otherwise make use of certain data from your web browser. <br>
                  a) We use a Session Cookie whenever you visit the  site in order to properly identify you as you move throughout the site. More  specifically, this Session Cookie is used so that you are recognised as 'Logged  in' as you navigate from page to page and so do not have to log in each time  you visit a new page. Session Cookies are always deleted as soon as you close  your web browser. <br>
                  b) We may also need to use a Session Cookie on the  Site when a User is shopping or purchasing items (eg site credit or site  membership packages) so that any items added into the ‘basket’ are all  available at the end of the session within the ‘Checkout’ Section.<br>
                  c) Users who directly stream a video through the  Site may require having a "Sticky Session Cookie" installed on their  web browser. This Cookie is in place to improve security and the protection of  any streams from unauthorised access, enabling Users to access the stream even  when navigating away from the Site temporarily.<br>
                  d) We use Google Analytics on the Site. Through the  use of cookies installed on your browser by Google when you visit the Site,  Google Analytics allows us to analyse and assess statistical data relating your  use of the Site, which is vital in helping us to monitor and improve various  aspects of the Site. An example of the kind of information Google Analytics  tracks include Number of Pages Visited, Bounce Rate of Pages, Geographical  Location of Visitors, Daily or Monthly Unique Visitors to the Site and so on.  Google Analytics does not share personal information from your web browser or  any information which could allow us to personally identify you.

                  e) Any Payment Processors which you can access  through the site may also send cookies to your browser in order to properly  track and identify you when you use their services. These cookies are used only  to ensure secure and reliable identification while you follow any payment or  money-related procedures or services.<br>
                  f) Through our Site’s Affiliate Programme, any  Users who access our Site through an Affiliate link (or Affiliate advert) on  the web will have a Persistent Cookie installed on their browser. This Cookie  will automatically expire and be deleted a pre-determined period, usually 1 to  30 days. Using this Cookie we can identify if any specific users - who have  accessed our Site through an Affiliate advert - make any purchases or complete  any significant transactions on the Site, thereby enabling us to calculate the  payment amounts due to the Members of our Affiliate Programme.<br>
                  g) Web browsers all have various settings on how  you can handle Cookies. You can always delete all Cookies stored on your  browser through its History Settings. You can also change the Options so that  the browser can refuse access to All or Certain types of Cookies. Refusing  access to Cookies through your browser however is likely to reduce the amount  of services and sites you are able to access over the web and impact on your  browsing experience.</p>

                <p>Certain aspects of the Site, including but without  limitation to, the credit card payment processors or Adobeâ„¢ Flash Video playing  software, are not associated with our Service and are classed as 3rd party  applications. These applications may require Users to download and install  additional software onto their computers or may require users to agree to a  separate Terms of Service or Privacy Policy before using or installing such  applications.<br>
