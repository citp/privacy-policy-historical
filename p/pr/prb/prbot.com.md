The user must provide her email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used to inform the recipient regarding who sent the email.

### Children

### Usage Tracking

We track user traffic patterns throughout our sites; however, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do categorize overall usage statistics according to user's domain name, browser type, refering page, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). We compile the number of unique visitors for each press release to display the most popular press releases on top.

We sometimes track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users prefer based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but how well each page performs. This assists in continuing to build a better service.

### Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal Information, although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal data a cookie contains is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other websites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns, as described above.

## Use and/or Sharing of Information

We may use any information voluntarily provided by our users to enhance their experience using our network of sites, whether providing interactive or personalized elements on the sites, or to prepare better future content based on our users' interests.

As stated above, we use information voluntarily provide by our users to send out electronic newsletters and to allow our users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users prefer, based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but how well each page performs. This assists us in continuing to build a better service. We track search terms entered in our search function as one of many means of determining what interests our users. We do not track which terms a particular user enters.

We compile aggregated reports regarding our user demographic and traffic patterns for our advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and lets our users receive advertisements that are more pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked its ad. We will not disclose any information about individual users except to comply with applicable laws or valid legal processes, or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

We may share limited aggregate reports with our users so that they may learn how their content is performing.

We permit third party advertisements on our site to support our site's function. Some advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information, including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. Generally, this is used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). You can view their privacy policy by [clicking here](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.
  * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.



We do not share voluntary or non-voluntary information gathered by us by means other than explained above.

## Opt-Out Policy
