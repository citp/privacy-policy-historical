# Privacy Policy

| 

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

## Information We Gather and Track

We gather two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to contact a press release author, to receive our electronic newsletters, to email a friend, etc.
  * Information we gather through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs. Under no circumstances do we divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 



We Gather User Information In The Following Processes:

### Optional Voluntary Information

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

  1. #### Electronic Newsletter

We offer an optional [free electronic newsletter](https://web.archive.org/newsletter-subscription.html) to users. We gather the email address and other information of users who voluntarily subscribe. Such information is used to send customized electronic newsletter to the subscribers and is not shared with any third parties. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. 

  2. #### Press Release Submission

We offer an optional [free press release submission](https://web.archive.org/submit-free-press-release.html) facility to users. Any information (except "Admin Email" if different from "Contact Email") such gathered may be automatically published on our website and made available to our website visitors, search engines, other websites through our RSS feeds, our electronic newsletter subscribers and by any other means not mentioned here. We may send a one time confirmation email at the email address provided.

  3. #### Press Release Account

We offer an optional [free press release account](https://web.archive.org/pub/pr-account.html) to users interested in advance features. Any information such gathered is used to customize the user's experience and is not shared with any third parties. We may send a one time confirmation email at the email address provided.

  4. #### "E-mail this to a friend"

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used to let the recipient know who sent the email. The user's IP address is also sent to the recipient for security purposes (Most of the online as well as offline email programs have the same behavior). Your information is not used for any other purpose.

  5. #### "Contact Author"

Our site users can choose to electronically contact a press release author by clicking "Contact Author". The user must provide their email address. This information is used to let the recipient know who sent the email. The user's IP address is also sent to the recipient for security purposes (Most of the online as well as offline email programs have the same behavior). Your information is not used for any other purpose.

  6. #### Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. We may use a system so that users can vote only once on a particular question. Opinions or any other information to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. 

  7. #### Surveys

We may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience and to improve our services. Any information such gathered will not be shared with any third parties.

  8. #### Preferences

Users may voluntarily provide personal preferences like timezone. Any information such gathered is used to customize user experience and will not be shared with any third parties.




### Children

We never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

### Usage Tracking

We track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). We track number of unique visitors for each press release to display the most popular press releases on top.

We sometimes track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

### Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).

## Use of Information

We use any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.

We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

## Sharing of the Information

We don't share any voluntary or non-voluntary information gathered by us by means other than explained above.

We have third party web service providers to display ads on our website. You can view their privacy policy by [clicking here](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

## Security

Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

## Opt-Out Policy

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  * Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.
  * Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users. 



## Your Consent

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by us. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
