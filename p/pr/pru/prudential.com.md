  * The number of visitors to our site
  * The pages visited on our site
  * The features used
  * How long a visitor stays
  * The domain name of the site from which visitors connect to our site
  * Browser and device information
  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies
  * Information that has been aggregated in a manner such that it no longer reveals your identity



We may also collect Other Information when you download and use an App. We may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of other ways, including: through a browser or device; using cookies, pixel tags or other similar technologies; and through IP addresses.

A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive.  It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally.  Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked. For registered customers, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences.

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Websites but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

Prudential uses cookies and pixel tags to provide better customer service, and to analyze how visitors use and navigate our websites, so we can improve our Websites.  Cookies also help us enhance navigation and the functionality of our Websites, to securely maintain a session for existing clients accessing password-protected areas, and to personalize aspects of a visitor's experience.

We collect information from cookies and pixel tags to evaluate responses to surveys and our advertisements on other websites and to provide you with specific or relevant content such as articles and educational material when you visit our Websites.  

Some of our Websites use cookies to better serve you when you return to the website. For example, a cookie may remember your user ID to simplify your login to a password-protected page.

Prudential may also use cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies to track your use of certain partner websites.  In addition, Prudential arranges for advertisements with links to Prudential Websites to be placed on third-party websites and web pages and may contract with other companies that use cookies, pixel tags, and other online technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with Prudential advertisements and your use of both Prudential and third-party websites.  These other companies may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.  This information may be used to show you Prudential advertisements and other advertisements that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites.  For more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please visit. <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> and <http://www.aboutads.info/> or the Ad Choices link at the bottom of our Websites.

  Each browser version works in a slightly different way, but you generally have the ability to accept all cookies, be notified before accepting a cookie, block or restrict cookies from certain sites, or reject all cookies. Because many websites use cookies to allow visitors to navigate easily, you may find that some websites or pages do not work well if you reject the cookies associated with them. At this time, Prudential does not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals.

We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information we receive from other sources. We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as personal information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information as detailed in this Statement. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with personal information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.
