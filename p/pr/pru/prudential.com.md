  * Interact with us on social media or websites and applications maintained by other parties



**Websites Covered by This Privacy Statement**  
This privacy statement applies to the Prudential websites and online communications that contain a link to this statement.  It does not apply to those websites or communications that have their own privacy statements or to websites of other companies or entities that are linked to our website.  To learn about the privacy policy of another website, please refer to the privacy statement for that website.  By using this website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy statement. 

This website is controlled and operated by Prudential from the United States and is intended for residents of the United States.  It is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.  If you are visiting from outside the United States, it may not necessarily be consistent with the laws and regulations of your home country.

**Kinds of Information We Collect**  
If you choose to take advantage of some of the website’s features or services, we may ask you to provide certain personal information about you or that may be used to personally identify you or to contact you.  

There are times when you may choose to give us your personal information.  For example, you may provide us with your name, telephone number, policy or account number, mailing address, email address, or date of birth when you:

  * Request a quote for insurance;
  * Request that a Prudential representative contact you; 
  * Register for a service;

You may provide us with your financial information and goals when you use certain services, features, and tools on our websites. 

We also collect information about visitors to our websites. The kind of information we may collect includes:

  * Information from the browser and device you use to visit our websites or to use our mobile applications (such as the type of device, the operating system name and version, and the browser version);
  * The IP address and information related to the IP address (such as domain information, the Internet provider, and your geographic location);
  * Website and app visitor data (such as the number of visitors to our websites, the pages visited, the features used, browsing history, and how long you stay on our websites); and
  * How you search for our websites or applications (such as the domain name of the website from which you connect), what websites you click on from our website or emails, and your browsing activities across other websites (provided to us through a third party).



To do this, a unique cookie or pixel tag is placed on your browser. 

A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally. Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked. For registered customers, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences.

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our websites but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

We also collect information through emails. From time to time, we may send you emails about our products and services. Prudential and third parties with which we contract may collect information regarding your interaction with these emails, including whether you opened the email, how long you viewed the email, and whether you opened any links in the email.  

To access online information about your Prudential account, you may register for access through [https://www.prudential.com/clientenroll](https://www.prudential.com/wps/portal/production/prudential/links/privacy-statement/!ut/p/z1/lZDLDsIgEEW_xS9gpAFhSRsCDSKmTR-yMawaEq0ujN8vcWfVWu9uknNmJhd51CM_hnscwi1exnBK88HTo2Faaq1gqyouQWhqsc3zjDUEdROgVgmQFacNlZnZEOSX-FxAuWZFAlydgaCFpbglGNi_PuwdA2Fxa-zOYYVhmQ9fIhb6M4CfX98hPznx3uATmKvoFfjQwa8vrucmpYdYDqsHlElyZw!!/?1dmy&pswid=Z7_K8HEHHG0LGR9E0AH6M2MBB38H4&urile=wcm%3apath%3a/wps/wcm/connect/portal+site/z6_000000000000000000000000a0/z6_k8hehhg0lgmu70aut3q5lo18a2/z6_9a0i18c0lgc790aerib8goih95).

Prudential uses cookies and pixel tags to provide better customer service, and to analyze how visitors use and navigate our websites, so we can improve our websites. Cookies also help us enhance navigation and the functionality of our websites, to securely maintain a session for existing clients accessing password-protected areas, and to personalize aspects of a visitor's experience.

Some of our websites use cookies to better serve you when you return to the website. For example, a cookie may remember your user ID to simplify your login to a password-protected page.

Prudential may use cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies to track your use of certain partner websites.  In addition, Prudential arranges for advertisements with links to Prudential websites to be placed on third party web sites and web pages and may contract with other companies that use cookies, pixel tags, and other online technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with Prudential advertisements and your use of both Prudential and third-party websites. These other companies may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. This information may be used to show you Prudential advertisements and other advertisements that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites.

Each browser version works in a slightly different way, but you generally have the ability to accept all cookies, be notified before accepting a cookie, block or restrict cookies from certain sites, or reject all cookies.
