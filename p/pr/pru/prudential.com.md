# Prudential: Directory

At Prudential, we understand that privacy is an important issue for visitors to the Prudential Web site (www.prudential.com). The following information is designed to help visitors understand what information we gather from our site, and how we handle the information once we gather it. 

  * Personal Information Collected on this Web Site
  * Site Visitorship Data Collected on this Web Site
  * Prudential's Use of Cookies
  * Security
  * Hyperlinks
  * Changes to Prudential's Internet Privacy Policy

**Personal Information Collected on this Web Site**  
Prudential collects personal information that site visitors provide when they complete any online form, application, survey, or when they request a quote for insurance. 

Information provided in a request for service or information is forwarded to the Prudential affiliate or business that will respond to the request. Requests for information or service relating to buying or selling a home are forwarded to the independently owned and operated Prudential real estate franchisee able to respond to the request, along with the information provided by the site visitor. 

Any information a site visitor submits to obtain an insurance quotation will be provided to a Prudential agent if the visitor uses the online application to request an appointment with an agent. The agent may be a Prudential employee or a non-employee agent. Site visitors who don't want quote information provided to agents this way can avoid it by using our Office Locator tool to contact agents directly. 

Prudential may contact visitors who have submitted a request for additional information about the request. 

Prudential may use information submitted in one of our online forms to ask site visitors to complete a voluntary customer satisfaction survey. In order to understand consumer preferences, Prudential may combine survey response information with information about customers who recently purchased products. 

Prudential does not rent or sell visitors' personal information to non-Prudential companies. 

**Site Visitorship Data Collected on this Site**  
Prudential uses aggregated site visitorship data to improve the content and services offered to its site visitors. Prudential reports site visitorship data on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means no personal information is associated with it. This data can include: 

  * how many people visit our site; 
  * the pages they visit; 
  * how long they stay on our site; and 
  * the domain name of the site visitors are connecting from (aol.com for example). 



**Prudential's Use of Cookies**  
"Cookies" are small text files that a Web site transfers to a site visitor's hard disk or browser for added functionality, or for tracking Web site usage. We do not use cookies to gather personal information like a person's name or e-mail address. In order to measure the effectiveness of our online presence, Prudential uses cookies to identify repeat visitors to our Web site, to determine the path visitors take on our site, and to identify visitors who came to Prudential as the result of a banner ad on a third party Web site. Any information gathered by the use of cookies is compiled on an aggregate, anonymous basis. 

**Security**  
When visitors submit information in one of our online forms, Prudential uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to protect the information they submit. This technology protects visitors from having their information intercepted by anyone other than Prudential while it is being transmitted. 

Prudential works hard to ensure that our systems are secure and that they meet industry standards. Where appropriate, we employ firewalls, encryption technology, user authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers) and access control mechanisms to control access to systems and data. 

**Hyperlinks**

Web sites linking to and from this site may have different privacy practices from the ones described here for www.prudential.com. Visitors to our site should read the privacy statements of other Web sites they visit. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. See our [Internet Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/universal/unzzz1019.html) for more information about Hyperlinks.
