<br><br>
<b>Personal data collection</b>
<br><br>

Personal information can be required, i.e. name, birth date, name of the company or firm, e-mail address and office telephone number, home or office address, information related to the profession, the firm or information related to a credit card. 
<br><br>

<b>Use of the personal information</b>

These companies will be only provided with the necessary information for the supply of the service and will be imposed to respect the privacy, by forbidding the use of provided data for a different purpose than the agreed one. 
<br><br>

<br><br>

Some services offered by PRAMAC.com include the contact with the customer. In this case the client will not have the chance to cancel the subscription to such mailing lists because the contact with the client represents an essential service. 
<br><br>
<b>Access to personal information</b>
<br><br>
The "technical support centre" allows modifying and updating personal information and preferences expressed on the Site regarding the methods in which you wish to be contacted. For viewing your own personal data, it is necessary to enter your own access name and password.

<br><br>
<b>Protection of personal information</b>
<br><br>
PRAMAC is committed to protect unconditionally the privacy of personal information. The various used technologies and procedures of protection are finalized to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosing. For instance, personal information is stored on computer systems with limited access, placed in controlled structures. Moreover, when highly reserved personal data are transmitted on the Internet (like credit card number), they are protected through cryptography, e.g. with SSL protocol (Secure Sockets Layer). 
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br><br>
PRAMAC.com uses cookies for assuring the integrity of the registration procedure and for customizing the Site. A cookie is a small sized text file saved in the hard disk of the user from a web page. Cookies cannot be used for executing programs or sending viruses to the computer of the user. Cookies are assigned to the user in a univocal way and can be only read by the Web server of the domain which sent them. 
<br><br>
One of the main purposes of cookies is to make the user save time. For instance, if you customize a Web page or visit a website, a cookie will allow the visited site to recall specific information about the user in the following visits. The use of cookies allows providing the user with customized contents and simplifies the visit of the websites. At the following visit to the website, the previously provided information may be retrieved thus simplifying the use of customized features for the user. 
<br><br>
For the sending of cookies in PRAMAC website, a Web technology based on beaconing, also known as "clear gif" or action tag technology, may be used. Such technology allows PRAMAC to compile aggregated statistics related to the use of PRAMAC.com website, like for instance the links or the pictures. PRAMAC can provide its own partners with aggregated statistical data. 
<br><br>
User can accept or refuse cookies. Most of Web browses automatically accept cookies. Anyway the user can change the browser settings so that cookies are refused. If you decide to refuse cookies, it is possible that interactive features offered by the website could not be used anymore. 
<br><br>
<b>Use of Web Beacons</b>
<br><br>
PRAMAC.com web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, sometimes named as "pixel gif", which allow PRAMAC to count the number of users who visited those pages and to offer services, also in collaboration with other companies. PRAMAC.com may include Web beacon in e-mail messages or promotional newsletter for detecting whether the messages have been opened or the users performed any action after receiving them. 
<br><br>
Some Web beacons can be put by service providers of third parties for allowing detecting the efficacy of our advertising campaigns or of the e-mail communications. Such Web beacon may be used by user providers for putting a persistent cookie in the user's computer. That allows the service provider to recognize the computer every time the user visits certain Web pages or e-mail messages and compile anonymous information related to viewing these pages. PRAMAC forbids the use of Web beacon targeted to the access or collection of personal information of the user. 
<br><br>
<b>Changes to this informative report about privacy</b>
<br><br>
PRAMAC will be able to update, occasionally, this informative report about privacy. In these cases the date at the beginning of the informative report will be changed, at the "latest update" item. In case of substantial changes in the contents of the informative report, PRAMAC will inform the customers by publishing notices related to it in the homepage of the website PRAMAC.com or, in alternative, by directly sending notices to the users. PRAMAC suggests reading periodically this informative report about privacy so that you can always be up-to-dated about the initiatives performed by PRAMAC for protecting the privacy of collected personal information. 
<br><br>
