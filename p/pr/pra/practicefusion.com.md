# Practice Fusion | Privacy Policy

## Our Policy

Practice Fusion addresses the complexities and critical needs of today's healthcare environment by providing a free, web-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) application to physicians and a personal health record (PHR) to their patients. Practice Fusion is dedicated to protecting the privacy of the users of any of our products or services. Practice Fusion’s Electronic Health Record and Personal Health Record are developed for the highest levels of performance. Our world-class data centers are equipped with modern technology to securely house sensitive data.

Practice Fusion has numerous security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information within the system. These measures include encryption of communications using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) system, and using a secure messaging system when you transmit personal information or requests to your medical providers or patients through the PHR.

If you are a user of our On Demand services for physicians or our patient PHR, you sign a user agreement that explains how we use and disclose health information, and we have additional privacy policies for users of these services. The user agreements and additional privacy policies take precedence over this policy. You can find the user agreement and privacy policy for our physician portal here, and for our patient portal here. Please read these carefully before you use these services.
