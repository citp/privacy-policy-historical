##### B. How prAna Uses Your Information for Interest-Based Advertising

We and others may use information collected using third-party cookies, clear gifs, web beacons, or other technologies on our Site and in our emails to deliver prAna-branded advertising displayed to you on the Site, on other third-party websites, mobile apps, social media, or other online services and across the computers or devices you use. We and others also may use cookie information to know when you return to our website after visiting these third-party websites. We and others use this and other information about you to try to understand your interests and show you relevant advertising about products and services that may interest you. 

We also may display interest-based ads through digital advertising partners, like Facebook, Google, or other social media platforms or websites. For example, we may use these digital advertising partners to personalize ads you see on other websites or apps based on your shopping experience or other interactions with us. We do this only by sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of serving advertisements. The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted, and are not used for any other purpose. 

We also may use information we collect to deliver advertising that is targeted to individuals with similar interests. These tools allow us to create groups based on actual or assumed shared interests and/or factual characteristics based on anonymous and/or de-identified information to help us figure out what advertising may be most relevant. We also do this without having to share personal information with these third-party partners.   
For more information about this practice and your choices with respect to interest-based ads, see the “Your Rights, Choices and Opt-Outs” section below.
