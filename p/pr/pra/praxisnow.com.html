<p>
	Last Update: September 8, 2011
</p>
<p>
	Praxis Now, LLC ("we" or "us" or "Praxis") has established this Privacy Policy<br>
	to explain how it protects and manages the personal information that it collects from you online.
</p>
<p>
	1. Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure
</p>
<p>
	Your use of the www.PraxisNow.com website ("Website") and/or your registration for Website products<br>
	and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms<br>
	of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or services.
</p>
<p>
	We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, we will also revise the "last update"<br>
	date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Praxis may make new uses or disclosures of information collected from users,<br>
	such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the<br>
	life, health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request<br>
	of a law enforcement agency or a court order, and in such circumstances, this Website will not inform and obtain the<br>
	consent of the user prior to such change.
</p>
<p>
	A user may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe.<br>
	Please note that, if you do, this Website may suspend its provision of products and services to you.
</p>
<p>
	2. Accountability
</p>
<p>
	Praxis  collects certain "personal information" (information that personally identifies you) which may include,<br>
	but is not limited to, your name, email address, home or work address, telephone number, and information about your<br>
	computer hardware and software (e.g., IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and<br>
	referring web site addresses).
</p>
<p>
	We have implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its users, and to respond to any<br>
	inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that we will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level<br>
	of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
	Praxis has designated responsibility for your personal information to its operations manager, Rebecca London, who ensures<br>
	compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy. Other Praxis individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the<br>
	operations manager.
</p>
<p>
	3. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information
</p>
<p>
	Praxis collects and uses personal information for the following Identified Purposes:
</p>
<p>
	(a)  to understand user needs regarding Website  services;
</p>
<p>
	(b) to develop and provide our website and our products and services for our users;
</p>
<p>
	(c) to fulfill your requests for products, services or information;
</p>
<p>
	(d) to communicate with users and site visitors, when necessary, and to inform users of upgrades, as well<br>
	as of other products and services available from Praxis, its affiliates and third parties;
</p>
<p>
	(e) to allow users to access limited-entry areas of the Website;
</p>
<p>
	(f) to personalize some of our services and products for you and to deliver targeted advertisements and<br>
	offers from the Website and third parties;
</p>
<p>
	(g) to bill accounts and maintain payment records;
</p>
<p>
	(h) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request;
</p>
<p>
	(i) to respond to a legitimate claim, or to address our reasonable belief, that you are violating the rights<br>
	of any third party or any of the agreements or policies that govern your use of the Website or any product<br>
	or service on the Website;
</p>
<p>
	(j) to protect the services, products, information, or rights of the Website, including but not limited to<br>
	the security or integrity of the site; and
</p>
<p>
	(k) to identify and resolve technical problems concerning the Website, its information, products and services.
</p>
<p>
	The Website also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not individually attributable to you)<br>
	for its business analysis, operational, marketing and other promotional purposes.
</p>
<p>
	If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide<br>
	those companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their<br>
	rights to use and further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their work for us.
</p>
<p>
	4. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information
</p>
<p>
	Praxis limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the<br>
	Identified Purposes. Praxis does not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information<br>
	from children under the age of thirteen.
</p>
<p>
	When you visit the Website, a cookie may be placed on your computer or the cookie may be read if you have<br>
	visited the Website previously. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the Website, you<br>
	may not be able to view all the text on the screens, or to experience a personalized visit, or to subscribe<br>
	to certain service and product offerings on the Website.
</p>
<p>
	5. Disclosure, Processing and Retention
</p>
<p>
	We do not sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to anyone else, except:
</p>
<p>
	(a) to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes<br>
	(listed in Section 3, above);
</p>
<p>
	(b) to Praxis' employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, joint venturers, affiliates, consultants,<br>
	business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on our  behalf for any of the<br>
	Identified Purposes;
</p>
<p>
	(c)  as necessary if Praxis has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or<br>
	bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or<br>
	unintentionally) with Praxis' rights or property, other users of the Website, products or services, or<br>
	anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
</p>
<p>
	(d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with<br>
	an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities,<br>
	or we may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred<br>
	business assets. Also, in the event that Praxis or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal<br>
	information may be one of the transferred assets.
</p>
<p>
	Your information may be stored and processed in the United States, or in any other country in which Praxis or its<br>
	affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer<br>
	of information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
	6. Accuracy of Personal Information
</p>
<p>
	We will use reasonable efforts to keep personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing<br>
	the possibility of making inappropriate user decisions based on such information. Users are responsible for informing<br>
	Praxis about changes to their personal information. Praxis will use new or updated personal information it receives<br>
	from users to update its own records.
</p>
<p>
	7. Security Safeguards
</p>
<p>
	Praxis will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user's personal information.
</p>
<p>
	8. Access to Personal Information
</p>
<p>
	Praxis will afford you a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in your file only, upon request<br>
	to the operations manager at <a href="mailto:info@praxisnow.com">info@praxisnow.com</a> or by writing to:
</p>
<p>
	Praxis Now, LLC<br>
	PO Box 5020 PMB 1101<br>
	Rancho Santa Fe, CA 92067
</p>
<p>
	If Praxis  is not able to provide access to some aspect of a user's personal information, it will provide<br>
	reasons for denying access such as: that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party,<br>
	or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney-client privileged communications, or that the<br>
	information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably<br>
	be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.
</p>
<p>
	Users have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate,<br>
	by contacting Praxis at <a href="mailto:info@praxisnow.com">info@praxisnow.com</a>. Praxis will promptly<br>
	correct such personal information.
