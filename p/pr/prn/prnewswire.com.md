# PR Newswire Privacy Policy

Welcome to our website, prnewswire.com. 

  PR Newswire Association LLC (“PR Newswire” or “we”) is the global leader in news and information distribution services for professional communicators. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information about you, an individual person, as you visit the public pages available through this website, prnewswire.com or use the website to access restricted areas available only to members or journalists, including:

  * PR Newswire for Journalists (<http://media.prnewswire.com/en/jsp/main.jsp>), 
  *  ProfNet (<https://profnet.prnewswire.com/>), 
  * Online Member Center (<https://portal.prnewswire.com/>),
  * MultiVu (<http://www.multivu.com/>),
  * eWatch and its reporting capabilities (<http://ewatch.prnewswire.com/rs/login.jsp>), 
  * MEDIAtlas ([http://mediatlas.prnewswire.com/mediatlas/Login.aspx?LanguageID=1033&RedirectLink](http://mediatlas.prnewswire.com/mediatlas/Login.aspx?LanguageID=1033&RedirectLink)), 
  * Vintage Filings (<http://www.vfilings.com/>), and
  * The PR ToolKit for Small Business (<http://prtoolkit.prnewswire.com/index.php?s=19>).



This policy does not, however, cover the websites for Virtual Press Office (VPO), Notilog, Hispanic PR Wire, Hispanic Digital Network, LatinClips, or the websites listed [under “Regional Sites” on the left hand side of the home page.]

  News and journalism are public activities. Your name, business contact details, and professional interests and affiliations may well already be publicly available, particularly if you are a journalist, a recognized expert, or a PR professional.   We have created this privacy policy because we recognize that even in a business context you may have a need and expectation that your identity and interests be kept anonymous or private in certain circumstances. We want to be clear about when and how we protect that expectation. 

  **Information We Collect About You    
**   
You may visit a number of pages throughout the website without registration. We collect the information you or the member company you represent gives us:

  * When you register, providing your name, company, user id and password, and professional information.
  * When you contact us with questions or comments.
  * When a member company authorizes you to manage its account or use our web-based services on its behalf. On occasion, for example, for the experts listed in ProfNet, we may combine data collected from other sources and add it to the information you or the member company has provided  We may also compile your contact data from other sources, including public sources, to contact companies that may be interested in our products and services. 



We use cookies to gather and record information about visits, to make logging on easier for you, and, if you fill out a form requesting more information about our products and services, to understand your interests in more detail.  A cookie is a small file of information which is placed on your browser. That cookie then communicates with servers, ours or other companies we authorize to collect data for us, and allows  recognition of your personal computer. We associate a cookie with information that identifies you if you use the automatic recognition capabilities on restricted areas or if you ask us to contact you with additional marketing information.  We may use the resulting information in ways described below.     Our log servers collect standard web information about visits and system capabilities as you access and use the web pages covered by this policy. 

  **How We Use Information About You  
**   
How we use information about you depends upon the capacity in which you visit our sites. For example, if you simply visit our pages for news and do not register, we will not know who you are and will not collect information which identifies you. But if you are using the member-only areas routinely to represent a member company, we may note how the service is being used. 

  We may use the information about you in any of the following ways:

  * To provide the services you or the member company you represent requests.
  * To provide information you request.
  * To evaluate and improve our websites and services.
  * To contact you directly about your use of an account or service for which you are registered. 
  * To let you know about offerings, from us or from third parties, that may be of interest to you.
  * To create reports for member companies, including both aggregate trends and the media organizations that are viewing their releases.
  * To protect the integrity of our services and secured areas of our sites.
  * For any other purpose we tell you about when you submit information to us.



**  
Choice and Access  
**   
You may disable or block any cookies by using the tools available in your browser. If you are registering for a service, you may choose whether to activate automatic recognition when you register or after registration, you may disable the persistent cookie that supports recognition using the tools in your browser. If you choose to disable the cookies that support automatic recognition, you will need to re-enter your user ID and password each time you access a gated portion of the website.

Third party ad servers:  We may ask or authorize third parties to serve cookies on our web sites or pages and include web beacons in email marketing campaigns.  These cookies and web beacons may be used to track your responses and your interests in our offerings and web pages.  You may use the controls in your browser to disable the tracking functions or these cookie-based technologies. 

  You may choose not to receive marketing emails from us by following the directions at the bottom of the marketing emails we send you. Journalists and others who use ProfNet Experts may choose not to disclose their identity when in direct communication with experts and company information officers by following the directions on that website to "cloak" their identity.

  We value the accuracy of the information we have about you. Journalists, registered users, and experts and resources may update their information at any time by following directions available at registration for the particular service.

  **Disclosure to Third Parties  
**   
We reserve the right to disclose your name and information about you 

  * to investigate potential unauthorized access or misuse of our services,
  * to protect our assets or rights,
  * to the member company you represent if that company requests us to do so,
  * in response to valid legal process, or
  * as part of a merger or an acquisition by or other transfer to a third party of some or all of our business assets.  
 



**Children Under 13  
**   
Our services are directed to media and public relations professions. Our website and services are not intended for children 13 or under.

  **Security  
**   
PR Newswire uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information against theft, loss, or misuse.   Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage can be guaranteed to be 100 per cent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PR Newswire cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You remain responsible for protecting your user name and passwords and for the security of information in transit to us over the Internet. 

  **Changes to This Policy  
**   
We may change the provisions of this policy from time to time and urge you to check back here periodically. Your continued use of any of the websites or pages within the scope of this policy will be your acceptance of the version of the policy in place at the time of your visit.
