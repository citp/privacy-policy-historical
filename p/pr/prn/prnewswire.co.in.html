<p><em>Effective April 4, 2013 </em></p>

<p>Welcome to our websites.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
PR Newswire Association LLC (“PR Newswire” or “we”) is the global leader in news and information distribution services for professional communicators. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information about you, an individual person, as you&nbsp;visit certain of our websites: prnewswire.co.uk; www.prnewswire.se; www.prnewswire.co.in; www.prnewswire.co.il; <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com.br/">www.prnewswire.com.br</a> (our “corporate” sites).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certain services and pages listed above may be available via mobile app. This privacy policy governs the collection and use of data about you and your use of any PR Newswire mobile website or app.&nbsp; We may provide additional notice and choice options within the app itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to visit our corporate apps/websites or send us your contact data through them, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

<p>For additional information about how we collect and use information on other sites and for our services, please see the PR Newswire Privacy Policy [http://prnewswire.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=29532]</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect About You&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>For the corporate sites listed above, we only collect information that identifies you when you choose to give it to us, for example, if you contact us with questions or comments.</p>

<p>We may also add data compiled from other sources to contact you if we think you or the company you represent would be interested in our products and services.</p>

<p>We collect standard web information about visits and system capabilities as you access and use the web pages covered by this policy.&nbsp; We do not associate this data with you to identify you in the routine course of business.</p>

<p><strong>Website Usage and Cookies</strong></p>

<p><i>What are cookies?</i> A cookie is a small file of information which is placed on your browser. That cookie then communicates with servers, ours or those of other companies that we authorize to collect data for us, and allows recognition of your personal computer or other device you are using to access our apps or websites.</p>

<p><em>How do we use cookies on our corporate sites</em>? We allow a third party to set analytics, or performance cookies to collect and report aggregate information.&nbsp; These cookies provide reporting to us on an aggregate basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>How you can control cookies.&nbsp; </em>Most modern browsers offer you ways to control or block cookies.&nbsp; These browser controls will usually be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu in your toolbar.&nbsp; The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop or manage cookies.&nbsp; More information is available here, <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Information About You</strong></p>

<p>How we use information about you depends upon the capacity in which you visit our sites. For example, if you simply visit our pages for news and do not register, we will not know who you are and will not collect information that identifies you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you share content on our sites with your social network, some public information from that network may be included in our reports to the client that created that content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may use the information that we collect about you from our corporate sites in any of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To provide information you request.</li>
	<li>To evaluate and improve our websites and services.</li>
	<li>To let you know about offerings, from us or from third parties, that may be of interest to you.</li>
	<li>To provide information and reports regarding website activity to customers.</li>
	<li>For any other purpose we tell you about when you submit information to us.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<strong>Choice and Access</strong></p>

<p>You may choose not to receive marketing emails from us by following the directions at the bottom of the marketing emails we send you. &nbsp;<br>
We value the accuracy of the information we have about you. You may update or correct the information you submitted to us at any time by</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure to Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your name and information about you</p>

<ul>
	<li>to investigate potential unauthorized access or misuse of our services,</li>
	<li>to protect our assets or rights,</li>
	<li>in response to valid legal process, or</li>
	<li>as part of a merger or an acquisition by or other transfer to a third party of some or all of our business assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong></p>

<p>Our services are directed to media and public relations professions. Our website and services are not intended for children 12 or under.</p>

<p><strong>Security </strong></p>

<p>PR Newswire uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information against theft, loss, or misuse. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PR Newswire cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You remain responsible for protecting your user name and passwords and for the security of information in transit to us over the Internet.&nbsp;<br>
