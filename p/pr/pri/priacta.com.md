# Privacy Policy - Priacta

**Updated 27 May 2017**

Protecting your private information is our priority. This “Privacy Policy” applies to the Priacta.com web site at http://priacta.com managed by Priacta, Inc. (Kevin Crenshaw, CEO) and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Priacta, Inc. (“Priacta”) include Priacta.com and its officers. The Priacta.com website is an educational services site. By using the Priacta.com website, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Collection of your Personal Information

We oppose spam and make every effort to ensure that any communications from us inspire, add value, and improve the quality of your life, as well as being CAN-SPAM and CASL compliant.

While not required to use Priacta.com, you may choose to share and Priacta may then collect limited personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address, and in the case of our discussion boards, your birthday and social media alias and any general situations, experiences, insights, and biography you choose to share. Priacta may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your age or gender. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future. If you contact us outside of the website (e.g., by phone or email) we will, of course, gather personal and confidential information for use in assessing and advising you and your company.

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Priacta.com. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Priacta.com website.

Please keep in mind that if you publicly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Priacta’s public message boards or social commenting, this information may be collected and used by others.

Priacta encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Priacta so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Priacta is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Priacta.com website.

## Use of your Personal Information

Priacta collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s), to deliver the information, consultation, coaching, training, and other services you have requested (“Services”), and may use it to customize your experience on the website(s) by presenting the most pertinent information for your needs and interests. Priacta also collects and uses aggregated or NON-personally-identifiable information in the form of aggregated, generalized or anonymized experiences, insights, survey results and situations to improve its expertise and ability to assist all of its clients, to create case studies, and to teach and train.

If you opt in and have not since opted out to a specific mailing list, Priacta may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the specific information you requested or information directly related to it, possibly including products and services from Priacta and its affiliates, and Priacta may also contact you via surveys (which you may similarly opt out of) to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Priacta may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Priacta.com and its affiliated websites in order to determine what Priacta services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Priacta.com to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Priacta is a consulting firm that gathers and draws on a wide range of experiences with many firms and individuals worldwide. If you contact us for consulting advice, including outside the website (i.e., phone, email, in person) or use private online tools on Priacta.com, then the survey results, experiences, insights, situations, and other information you choose to share with us will be treated as confidential for the purposes of delivering the information, consultation, and other services you have requested, even if the consultation is free. However, Priacta reserves the right use aggregated, generalized or anonymized, non-personally identifiable, non-trade secret information from these discussions for purposes of studying and teaching leadership and related principles. In these cases, information will be aggregated or all identifying details randomly modified, obscured, or removed. If you have specifically consented to the disclosure of personally-identifiable information (i.e., a “testimonial” or via a separate contract) then that restriction will not apply to you.

Except as set forth herein, Priacta will not otherwise disclose your personal information, without notice, except when required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Priacta or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Priacta or its workers; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Priacta, its workers, its users, or the public.

## Use of Cookies

The Priacta.com website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Priacta.com pages, or register with Priacta.com site or services, a cookie helps Priacta.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Priacta.com website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Priacta.com features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Priacta.com services or websites you visit.
