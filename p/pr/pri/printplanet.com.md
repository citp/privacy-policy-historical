Aggregated usage and demographic information regarding users may be disclosed to third-party advertisers. In such circumstances, no information will be disclosed that could be decompiled to identify you. PrintPlanet does not intend to rent, lease, or sell any of your personally identifiable information to any third party. However, PrintPlanet may transfer such information to a third-party successor to PrintPlanet's business in connection with a merger, sale of assets, consolidation, reorganization, or other similar transaction.

PrintPlanet may disclose information about its users to third-party auditors as necessary to allow such third-party auditors to determine the accuracy of payments made to or received by our business partners. PrintPlanet may periodically employ third parties to perform various functions on its behalf. Such functions may include, for example, Web site hosting, data analysis, marketing research, customer service, and shipment of products. The third parties performing such functions will have access to your information solely as may be necessary for them to perform such functions.

PrintPlanet will disclose information about you as may be requested by law enforcement authorities, in order to protect the rights or property of PrintPlanet or when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to comply with the law or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or the violation of the Terms of Use. 

Due to the evolving regulatory environment, PrintPlanet cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other sensitive information will never be disclosed in a manner not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, but not by way of limitation, PrintPlanet may be forced to disclose information about you to governmental agencies; third parties may also unlawfully access such information. While PrintPlanet employs careful security measures, you should not expect that your sensitive information or private communications will always remain private.

Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that we use to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can not read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

You do not need to have cookies turned on to use PrintPlanet at this time, but that may change without notice in the future.
