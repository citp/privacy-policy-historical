# Privacy Statement

## Privacy statement

This privacy policy covers only the Primark website; links within this site to other websites are not covered by this policy. 

Primark's site does not store or capture personal information but merely logs the user's IP address which is automatically recognised by the web server. We use IP addresses contained in the web server's log files to analyse trends, administer the site, track user movements through the site as an aid to future development. 

### Cookies

We only use cookies for collecting information relating to the users' countries of viewing. We will not collect any information about you except that required for system administration of the web server. 

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer. It's stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the website to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. 

During the course of a visit to primark.co.uk, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit. 

How does Primark use cookies? When you first visit the Primark site you will be asked to tell us from which country you are accessing the site. Your input to this question is stored in a cookie and the country selection page is skipped the next time you access so that you do not have to answer the question again. 

This question is asked so that we can direct more relevant content to you. If you clear all cookies from your computer or have set your browser to not accept cookies then you will see the country selection page when you next access the site.

### Notification of Changes 

If we need to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes in this document so that users are always aware of which information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a chance to inform us not to use their information in a different manner. 

We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy in place when the information was collected.
