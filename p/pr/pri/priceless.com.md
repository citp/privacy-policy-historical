##  Personal Data We Collect Automatically 

We may collect certain information by automated means (e.g., cookies, log-file, web beacons) when you visit the Sites. The data collected automatically are processed in order to improve the Program and to provide you with the best information and services. The information we collect in this way tells us, for example, how many users visited our website and the pages accessed, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and helps us to identify features in which you may have the greatest interest. This information also allows us to make improvements and to enhance your experience.

_Log files and IP addresses:_  Log files are web server files (containing information such as the domain name or IP address, URL, the http response code, the website from where you visit us or the date and duration of your visit) that are automatically created when an Internet user visits a site. An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit the Site(s), we may collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. For example, when you request a page from the Site(s), our servers log your IP address. In combination with other data, this information helps us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what types of offers our customers like to see. In addition, log files help us to detect disruptions to telecommunication equipment and to detect abuse of our telecommunication services.

_Information collection from mobile devices_ : If you access our Site(s), on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, we also may collect your unique device identifier and mobile device IP address (e.g. MAC address), as well as information about your device’s operating system, mobile carrier, mobile Internet browsers, and other information described in this Privacy Notice.  In some regions, we may also have a Priceless Cities mobile application ( **“App”** ).  Note that the App has a separate privacy notice that will apply to the data collection and privacy practices and this Privacy Notice shall not apply to the App. 

_Cookies, web beacons and tracking links:_  We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site(s). The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze how visitors use our Site(s). The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these analytics providers, who use the information to evaluate use of our Site(s). We may offer users of our Site(s) choices to manage their preferences via our Cookie Consent Tool accessible via our AdChoices icon or via the Cookie Consent icon on our Sites.  Otherwise, you can opt out at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. To learn more about Cookies, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> or <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html> or our [Cookies Notice](https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/4754?v=1) available on the Site(s) in the European Economic Region, Turkey, Switzerland and Canada.

_Interest-Based Advertising:_ In some regions, we may collect information about your online activities on our Site(s) for use in providing you with advertising about materials and services tailored to your individual interests. We may also use your personal data and other information obtained about you from companies that use or facilitate the use of other MasterCard products or services and from publicly available information systems to deliver advertising and offers that may be of interest to you. You may see certain ads on other websites because we (and our partners) use data collected on our Site(s) to customize advertisements to you on third-party websites. This collection and use allows us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. In connection with providing you customized advertisements, third parties on our websites may track your online activities over time and across third-party websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The information collected includes information about your visits to certain websites, the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on those websites. This data collection takes place both on our Site(s) and on third-party websites. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

Examples include our operating platform providers, platform hosting providers, redemption fulfillment providers and customer service providers. When we use third party service providers, we take all necessary steps to ensure that our service providers maintain a high level of data protection.

##  Data Security 

We may hold your personal data in a variety of ways, including in electronic form.

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the personal data in our possession.

When you provide personal data online, we use the industry standard for encryption on the Internet – Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology – to help protect the information that you provide. This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your device to our server. You will know that you are in a secure area of the Site(s) when a lock icon appears on your screen that the “http” prefix of our URL address changes to “https”. The “s” represents “secure”. We also use digital certificates to ensure that you are connected to the authentic Site(s).

Please note however that no collection or data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any data transmission.

We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence, such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).
