<p>Like most website operators, Print Friendly &amp; PDF collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Print Friendly &amp; PDF's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Print Friendly &amp; PDF's visitors use its services. From time to time, Print Friendly &amp; PDF's may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.</p>
