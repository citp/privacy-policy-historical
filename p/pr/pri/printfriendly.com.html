	<ul>
	<li>We don’t ask for personal information unless it's needed to provide a service or develop our products.</li>
	<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
	<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="http://support.printfriendly.com/">support team</a>.</p>
	<p>It is <strong>Print Friendly &amp; PDF</strong>'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
	<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
	<p>Like most website operators, Print Friendly &amp; PDF collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Print Friendly &amp; PDF's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Print Friendly &amp; PDF's visitors use its services. From time to time, Print Friendly &amp; PDF's may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.</p>
	<!--<p>Print Friendly & PDF's also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Print Friendly & PDF only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>-->
	<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Certain visitors to Print Friendly &amp; PDF's websites choose to interact with Print Friendly &amp; PDF in ways that require Print Friendly &amp; PDF to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Print Friendly &amp; PDF gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors that purchase Print Friendly &amp; PDF Ad-Free service to provide the necessary personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Print Friendly &amp; PDF collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Print Friendly &amp; PDF. Print Friendly &amp; PDF does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

	<p>Print Friendly &amp; PDF may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Print Friendly &amp; PDF may monitor the most popular pages being printed to ensure the service is working properly. Print Friendly &amp; PDF may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Print Friendly &amp; PDF does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
	<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Print Friendly &amp; PDF discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Print Friendly &amp; PDF’s behalf or to provide services available at Print Friendly &amp; PDF’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Print Friendly &amp; PDF’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Print Friendly &amp; PDF will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Print Friendly &amp; PDF discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Print Friendly &amp; PDF believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Print Friendly &amp; PDF, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of  Print Friendly &amp; PDF and have supplied your email address, Print Friendly &amp; PDF may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Print Friendly &amp; PDF and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Print Friendly &amp; PDF takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

	<p>If Print Friendly &amp; PDF, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Print Friendly &amp; PDF goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Print Friendly &amp; PDF may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
	<h3>Ads</h3>
