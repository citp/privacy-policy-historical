You can withdraw your consent at any time by emailing [privacy@printify.com](mailto:privacy@printify.com) or by navigating to your profile page and managing your data settings.

**Contract:**

Processing your data is necessary for a contract you have with us, or because we have asked you to take specific steps before entering into that contract.

**Legitimate interests:**

Processing your data is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests.

**These legitimate interests are:**

  * gaining insights from your behaviour on our website or in our app
  * delivering, developing and improving the Printify service
  * enabling us to enhance, customise or modify our services and communication
  * determining whether marketing campaigns are effective
  * enhancing data security



In each case, these legitimate interests are only valid if they are not outweighed by your rights and interests.

> Summary: When it comes to your data and privacy, you have a lot of control for what Printify can do. All of your data settings can be managed from your Printify account page, or by emailing us at [privacy@printify.com](mailto:privacy@printify.com). These include your rights to review, correct and delete your data.

Your rights

You can exercise your rights at any time by sending us an email at [privacy@printify.com](mailto:privacy@printify.com) or by navigating to your Printify account page.

**You have the right to access information we hold about you**

This includes the right to ask us supplementary information about:

  * the categories of data we’re processing
  * the purposes of data processing
  * the categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed
  * how long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period)
  * your other rights regarding our use of your data



We will provide you with the information within one month of your request, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other (e.g. another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights). We’ll tell you if we can’t meet your request for that reason.

**You have a right to see what personal information has been shared with third parties.**

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 allows users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you would like to make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@printify.com](mailto:privacy@printify.com).

**You have the right to make us correct any inaccurate personal data about you**

If after accessing your information, you believe that we have incorrect or inaccurate data, you can request us to change or correct it.

**You can object to us using your data for profiling you or making automated decisions about you**

We may use your data to determine whether we should let you know information that might be relevant to you (for example, tailoring emails to you based on your behaviour). Otherwise, the only circumstances in which we will do this is to provide the Printify service to you.

**You have the right to port your data to another service**

We will give you a copy of your data in CSV or JSON so that you can provide it to another service. If you ask us and it is technically possible, we will directly transfer the data to the other service for you. We will not do so to the extent that this involves disclosing data about any other individual.

**You have the right to be ‘forgotten’ by us**

You can do this by asking us to delete any personal data we hold about you, if it is no longer necessary for us to hold the data for purposes of your use of Printify.  
You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our use of your data  
Please tell us first, so we have a chance to address your concerns. If we fail in this, EU residents can address any complaint to the relevant data authority from this list: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>

The US does not view privacy in the same way and has not established processes for lodging complaints for the type of data we are collecting. If you have a complaint about our use of your data, reach out to us at [privacy@printify.com](mailto:privacy@printify.com) and we will address your concerns as best we can.

**Our Infrastructure**

Printify operates on servers and cloud components that comply with strict international standards. Access to infrastructure at Printify is securely controlled and available from specific locations only. This access is limited to specific employees only and protected by 2-factor authentication.

Data is stored in the US region by default on AWS/Azure servers and is continuously backed up. Our infrastructure’s data centres and cloud services from providers are protected by physical access controls, intrusion and fire detection systems and 24/7 professional security staff.

**Document security**

All documents and information are version controlled by Atlassian services by defaults, so there’s a permanent trail not only on the database level but also on the storage level.

**Monitoring**

We have continuous resource and infrastructure access monitoring in operation 24/7, 365 days a year. Any alerts generated by our monitoring system are sent to team members immediately and actioned. Printify uses both third parties and in-house scans for vulnerability testing and app protection (WAF).

**Training and audits**

Regular third party audits are conducted at Printify to ensure we use the latest technologies and best practices to protect data. All employees at Printify are trained in data security and are bound by strict confidentiality provisions.

**And please remember:**

  * You provide personal data at your own risk: unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure
  * You are responsible for the security of your username and password: keep them secret and safe.
  * If you believe your privacy has been breached, please change your password as soon as possible and contact us immediately on [customercare@printify.com](mailto:customercare@printify.com) or via Intercom using the chat icon.



The personal data we collect is processed at our offices in San Francisco and Riga and in any data processing facilities operated by the third parties identified below.

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing by us. If we transfer or store your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

We will archive and stop actively using any personal identifiable information about you within 6 months from the last time you used Printify. We will delete your personal data from our archives no later than 6 years from the last time you used Printify or upon your request.

> Summary: To effectively run Printify we need to partner with various third parties around the world. These include our print providers that work with us to offer and fulfill products and services and also tools like Google Apps and Intercom that allow us to communicate and deliver our service to you. This section outlines who we work, for what purposes and where you can find more information about their privacy policies.

To deliver the best possible Printify experience we often have to partner with third parties to deliver services that we cannot. These include our print partners that we work with to offer products and fulfill orders, services that support our communications, both internal for our team and external when we communicate with you, tools that keep our web platform and API running, as well as services that allow us to study the use of our platform and learn how best to develop and design new features, messages and offers. 

When we do this, sometimes it is necessary for us to share your data with them in order to get these services to work well. Your data is shared only when strictly necessary and according to the safeguards and good practices detailed in this Privacy Policy.

Here are the details of our main third-party service providers, the data being collected or shared and the reason sharing is necessary.
