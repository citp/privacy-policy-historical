# Privacy Policy | Primo® Purely Amazing Water and Water Dispensers

#### EFFECTIVE DECEMBER, 2016

Primo Water Corporation (“Primo”) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “we” and “our”) are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information you provide to us when you visit this website. Our Privacy Policy sets out our practices for collecting, maintaining, using, sharing, and protecting the information you provide to us. 

#### Information We Collect and How We Use It

You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information (“PII”) to visit this website. When you choose to place an order for Primo® product for your home or business (the “Service”), the PII necessary to complete your order will be collected by us or by a third-party vendor retained for this purpose. This PII may include your name, email address, street address, and payment information (which may include credit card name and number, security code, and expiration date or debit card information or checking account information). If applicable, your company name may be collected for your order. We may also ask how you heard about Primo®. This same information is collected when you place an order for the Service by telephone. Similar information may be collected as necessary to address any customer service issues you report to us, either through this website or through our customer service telephone line. Calls may be recorded for training and quality purposes. We will not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. If you contact us by telephone or by email, your telephone number and/or email are automatically saved and stored by us for training and quality purposes. This information may be used should follow up communications be necessary. We may use the information you provide to us to fulfill orders you place with us, to give you personalized service, including customer service, and to respond to your inquiries or requests for information. If you authorize us to do so, we may contact you for other purposes, such as improving our products and services to you and providing information that may be targeted to your interests, including, for example, special product and service offerings. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you may inform us by using **[Contact Us](https://primowater.com/contact-us/)** or by calling (866) 429-7566. This opt-out procedure does not apply to warranty replacement order updates. Either we or a company we retain to assist with maintaining our website may collect additional information from you as a visitor to the site, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser version and type, and any referring website address. This information may be logged by us or our hosting company to help diagnose technical problems and to administer the website to improve the quality of our service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying information and aggregate usage and volume statistical information and provide this anonymous statistical information to third parties. It may not be readily apparent that this information is being collected. If you would like to find out more about the privacy practices of our hosting company, please contact us at the address below and we will give you the name and contact information for our current hosting company. We may use a browser feature known as “cookies,” which are small files sent from our website to your computer. Cookies are used for a variety of reasons, such as remembering user names and passwords and preferences and tracking click streams. Cookies allow us to provide better service and a more personalized experience on our website. Your browser gives you the option to reject cookies, but doing so generally hinders the browser’s performance and will adversely affect your experience when using our website. We also track information about where you go on our website. This helps us determine the most-used areas of our website so that we can provide the best website possible. This information is only gathered collectively; it is not associated with any specific individual. It may not be readily apparent that this information is being collected. This type of information may occasionally be provided to third parties to demonstrate interest in our website and to help us administer the website. 

#### How We Protect Your PII

We are committed to protecting the PII you choose to provide to us by protecting against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the PII and protecting against unauthorized access to or use of the PII. Accordingly, the PII you provide to us will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access. We do not collect or store credit card information, and we use third-party services such as Authorize.NET and BrainTree for completing all transactions. We will not share or sell your PII to any third party for its use in marketing, but we may share your PII with third parties we have hired to perform work related to provision of the Service to you. 

#### How you May Change Your PII

You may review, update, modify or remove your PII at any time, either by modifying any account you have created with us online or informing us by using **[Contact Us](https://primowater.com/contact-us/)** or by phone at (866) 429-7566. 

#### Children’s Privacy

This website is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly or intentionally collect PII from children through our website under any circumstance. Please do not allow children to provide such information or participate in our website programs. If you become aware that this has occurred, please contact us at the address below to request the deletion of that information. 

#### Third-Party Websites

Our website may contain links to third-party websites. Any information you provide when accessing a third party’s website is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We do not control the use of the information you provide there, and we assume no responsibility for your sharing of information there. 

#### When We May Disclose Information

We may disclose PII when we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to protect others, or to protect the rights, property, and best interests of our business and our affiliates. If ownership of your account for the Service is transferred, the party acquiring the account will receive access to the PII you provided to us. Finally, if we sell or transfer part or all of our business assets, consumer information may be one of the assets transferred as part of the transaction. 

#### We May Revise this Policy at Any Time

This Privacy Policy is effective as of May, 2016. We may update this Privacy Policy whenever new developments in business, technology, law, or regulation call for changes. Any updates will be made by posting a revised policy on the website, with an effective date for the revision.
