# Privacy Policy

Australian Pharmaceutical Industries Limited ‘API’ ABN 57 000 004 320 recognises the importance of privacy issues. This Privacy Policy briefly tells you how we manage the personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if you have any queries. This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information collected or held by us about our employees and is to be read subject to any overriding provisions of law or contract. 

**Background**

API provides pharmaceutical and other health related products and services to retail pharmacies and the health market generally. In providing these products and services to you, we handle information about you. In doing so we have adopted the handling requirements set down in the Commonwealth Privacy Act including the National Privacy Principles. 

API from 21 December 2001, complied with the law and the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs") (subject to the other provisions of law). The NPPs are contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and regulate the manner in which personal information is managed. 

API is committed to ensuring an individual's right to keep their personal information private and we strive to ensure privacy, accuracy and security of your personal and financial information. 

Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion. 

There are further special provisions which apply to the collection of some personal information which is known as sensitive information. This includes health information and information about a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal history. 

**Collection of personal information by us**

We are required to collect personal information to be able to provide requested products or services. 

The kinds of personal information we collect and store will depend on what products and services you request from us. However, it may include (amongst other things): 

  * personal information you give us when you request a product or service from us. This information may include your opinion/preferences about specific products and services, your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, credit card details;
  * communications between you and us; and
  * transactional information about your use of our products and service. 



**How your personal information will be used**

We collect your personal information so that we can use it for our functions and activities which include, amongst other things: 

  * processing your orders;
  * being aware of any special product and service requirements you may have;
  * providing you with electronic confirmation of your orders (where applicable) and advising you of any changes to our products and services;
  * confirming your identity when you contact us;
  * addressing any feedback or complaints you may have;
  * any purposes for which it was requested and directly related purposes, and developing, improving and marketing our products and services. 



If you do not provide us with your personal information, we will be unable to do one or more of the above (including being unable to accept any orders and service requests). 

We will assume you consent to management of your personal information in the manner specified in this Privacy Policy (which may change from time to time) until you tell us to the contrary by contacting us using our contact details below. 

**Exchange of personal information with third parties**

Personal information we collect from you may be disclosed: 

  * to any entity to which we are required or authorised by or under law to disclose such information (for instance, Federal or State law enforcement agencies and investigative agencies, courts, various other Federal or State government bodies);
  * to others that you have been informed of at the time any personal information is collected from you;
  * to our business associates and others for purposes directly related to the purpose for which the personal information is collected;
  * to API management and personnel;
  * to our professional advisors and other contractors (for example IT consultants and mailing houses); or
  * with your consent (express or implied), to others. 



We may also obtain personal and other information from some or all of the above to enable us to provide our services or products to you. When we obtain personal and other information from third parties whom we are referred to by you, we will assume and you will ensure that you have made that third party aware of the referral of the persons and purposes involved in the collection, use and disclosure of the relevant personal or other information. 

**Use and disclosure of personal information by us**

If we use or disclose your personal information for a purpose (the "secondary purpose") other than the main reason for which it was originally collected (the "primary purpose"), to the extent required by law, we will ensure that: 

  * the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection (and directly related in the case of sensitive information), and you would reasonably expect that we would use or disclose your information in that way; or
  * you have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information for the secondary purpose; or
  * the use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or
  * the use or disclosure is otherwise permitted by law (for example, as a necessary part of an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).
