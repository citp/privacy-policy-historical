<br><br>

<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong>

<br><br>

Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.

<br><br>

<h3>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h3>

<h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>

<br>

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.

<br><br>

<h3>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h3>

<br>

As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.

<br><br>

<h3>IP Addresses</h3>

<br>

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.

<br><br>

<h3>Sharing and Selling Information</h3>

<br><br>

We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.

<br><br>

<h3>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h3>

<br>

You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual address.

<br><br>

<h3>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</h3>

<br>

We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.

<br><br>

<h3>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</h3>

<br>

We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.

Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

<br><br>

<h3>Your Consent</h3>

<br>

By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.

<br><br>

<h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>

<br>

Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship.

<br>

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so.

	We are very happy with the course and videos that we bought from the website.
	<br><br>
	We actually used the account for our son (who is upper level) and our daughter (who is lower level) so it was a real bargain for us. The cost was the same as sending the kids to a tutor for just one lesson.

	I thought I'd send a quick email that you can use on your site if you want to.
	<br><br>	
	This system is excellent, full of practice questions and even videos with actual tutors.
	<br><br>
	If anyone is on the fence they should really consider buying it, it is great value.

	We spent about $2000 on tutoring for our boy before the exam, which was a lot of money.
	<br><br>
Just came across your website and bought the package, so much great information. I'm sure he will get a lot of help from this and it is so cheap in comparison.

	After 3 months of spending $85/hour for a private tutor, my son was still not ready.
	<br><br>
	We are so glad that we bought your program. My son enjoyed doing the practice questions and watched the videos instead of TV. He really felt confident when he tested. Thank you.
