This Privacy Policy governs your use of this web site, located at www.PrincetonReview.com (this "Web Site"), which is made available by The Princeton Review, Inc. ("The Princeton Review" or "we" or "us").

Your privacy is a serious matter to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of Personal Information and other information that is collected through this Web Site and how that information is used and protected.

By visiting this Web Site, and/or using the services offered on or through this Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our Web Site Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy may change, so check back to this page from time to time. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, The Princeton Review [Web Site Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.aspx) which govern your use of this Web Site in general. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our on–line customers as well as to visitors of our free Web sites.

We may from time to time ask you for Personal Information, and we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit our Web Site.

For example, on this Web Site, you may be able to elect to or not to receive correspondence from us or have your Personal Information shared with other entities for their marketing purposes. You may also make this request by visiting our Manage Your Subscriptions web page and indicating which correspondence you would like to receive. If you do not want to receive any promotional correspondence, simply uncheck all of the boxes of the [My Communication Preferences](https://web.archive.org/mycommpreferences.aspx).

User–Provided Information

We may collect Personal Information from users, for example, through such user's activities, transactions and completion of surveys and other online forms on our Web Site.

WE COMPLY WITH U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS WITH REGARD TO THOSE PAGES OF OUR SITE USED TO FURNISH INVESTOR RELATIONS MATERIALS SUCH AS ELECTRONIC PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL REPORTS (THE " **INVESTOR RELATIONS PAGES** ").

Clear GIFs

We may use "clear GIFs" (a/k/a "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, on the Web Site and/or in our communications (e.g., in our HTML–based e–mails) which enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received or opened a message. This allows us to know the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

IP Address and Clickstream Data

Our server may automatically collect data about your server's Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. In addition to logging your IP Address and sometimes your domain name, our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; how long you stay on this Web Site, the Web site you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about your computer and its settings; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data.

Matching Web Site Usage Information and Personal Information

Web Site Usage Information may be tracked in both aggregate form and at an individual user level. We may also match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. We may also analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e–mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

We may use your Personal Information, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings (for example, to process your orders and respond to your requests and inquiries). We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping. In addition, we may send you e–mail notices and offers and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt–out of receiving such notices and offers from us, at any time, by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above

Short Message Service

We may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your cell phone or other wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). If you subscribe to one of our SMS Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS Service messages from us at the address you provide for such purposes (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above).

You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the SMS Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. To use the SMS Service, you must be 18 years of age or older, or otherwise be authorized to accept the applicable charges on your carrier bill, and reside in the United States. You must first register and provide all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS address, wireless carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS Service you subscribe to, billing information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.

You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/or service–related complaints.

Third Party Offers

We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other third parties who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you.

Business Transfer

In the event that The Princeton Review or all or a portion of its business, or one or more of its divisions, is acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.

The Princeton Review will take steps to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive Personal Information provided to us.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e–mail address, we may notify you by e–mail. **You consent to our use of e–mail as a means of such notification.
