In general, our service automatically gathers aggregate usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Pridenation to allow us to determine the most popular portions of Pridenation's website and to improve the site. At present, Pridenation does not use "cookies" which can collect individual usage information, nor do we normally track activity by any specific email or IP address. The only time we may seek out an email or IP address is when a contributor to our site has caused harm, or if required to do so by court order or law. We may provide statistical "ratings" information, but not personal usage information, to our associates, affiliates, prospective advertisers, etc. for the purpose of demonstrating usage and/or traffic volume.
