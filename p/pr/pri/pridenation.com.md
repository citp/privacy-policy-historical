Pridenation/ PNN ("Pridenation"), a division of AEU Media Group, wants to protect the privacy of its patrons and users of its entertainment products and services and protect the privacy of children who may use this website.  Please check back to this page frequently to learn of any changes or updates to this policy.  Please also read the Terms of Service before using this website. The services promoted by this website are intended for adults ages 18 and up.  This website may not be used by children under the age of 18 years old without the guidiance and participation of a parent or guardian.  This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you, a visitor to this website, of the type of information we may collect about you when you visit, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and your choices regarding our use of your information.  This policy applies only to the pages within Pridenation's website in which the Pridenation / PNN logo appears, and not to the pages and/or website of any companies, individuals or other organizations that may link to our site or that we may link to. 

**information about visitors**

In general, our service automatically gathers aggregate usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Pridenation to allow us to determine the most popular portions of Pridenation's website and to improve the site. At present, Pridenation does not use "cookies" which can collect individual usage information, nor do we normally track activity by any specific email or IP address. The only time we may seek out an email or IP address is when a contributor to our site has caused harm, or if required to do so by court order or law. We may provide statistical "ratings" information, but not personal usage information, to our associates, affiliates, prospective advertisers, etc. for the purpose of demonstrating usage and/or traffic volume. 

We specifically ask for personal information when you sign up for membership, when you place any type of order, when you request an "Instant Invite," and you sign up for our mailing list, and when you utilize our "Community Forums."  Other areas of the site, such as the Chat room, allow you to voluntarily include information about yourself (e.g. such as a screen name and/or profile). We will need certain information, such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, credit card number and phone number, in order to providethe requested service and/or product. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested from Pridenation.  Occasionally, we may allow a third-party company to access relevant portions of such information to contact you with an offer or information that we determine to be particularly appropriate for our email and/or mailing lists. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know by emailing us at [info@pridenation.com](mailto:info@pridenation.com)with enough identifying informaiton to locate your record.

We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies except as mentioned above.

Pridenation.com is concerned about the safety and privacy of young people using our services. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use our site without the guidance and/or participation of a parent or guardian. Pridenation.com has made the commitment to not include any pornography or any adult website material on our main pages.  We encourage parents to participate in your child's online experience and to use web filtering software to prevent access to any unwanted areas of the web. Pridenation does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to use any of our media services including radio programming, tv programming and after-hours pay-per-view programming. These services require a subscription sign-up which is limited to members 18 years of age or older (21 years of age in some states), and requires a password.
