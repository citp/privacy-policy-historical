**Our Commitment to Privacy**

Prison Fellowship values your privacy.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**Web Sites This Policy Covers**

This policy applies to the following sites:  Prison Fellowship ([www.pfm.org](http://www.pfm.org/)), BreakPoint ([www.breakpoint.org](http://www.breakpoint.org/)), Angel Tree ([www.angeltree.org](http://www.angeltree.org/)), Justice Fellowship ([www.justicefellowship.org](http://www.justicefellowship.org/)), The Wilberforce Forum ([www.wilberforce.org](http://www.wilberforce.org/)), Council for Biotechnology Policy ([www.biotechpolicy.org](http://www.biotechpolicy.org/)), and Operation Starting Line ([www.operationstartingline.net](http://www.operationstartingline.net/)).

**Personal Information We Collect**

On some areas of our site, you are prompted to provide us with personal information when you, for example, make a donation, order products, register to receive newsletters, register for an online course, apply to be a volunteer, or fill out a petition.  Also, some areas of our site require personal information before access is granted (for example, the BreakPoint commentary archive).  The types of personal information collected at these pages vary, but may include the following kinds of general information:

> Name  
>  Address  
>  Email address  
>  Phone number  
>  Credit/Debit Card Information  
>  (etc.)

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:

> Name  
>  Address  
>  Phone Number  
>  (etc.)

We may from time to time give users the opportunity to participate in online surveys to provide feedback on aspects of our ministry.  These surveys are always optional, and data collected in them will only be used in aggregate, to better understand how people respond to our ministry efforts and how those efforts might be improved.

**The Way We Use Personal Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order.

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order to ship the product and to confirm delivery.

We use email addresses to fulfill your requests for newsletter subscriptions and to answer the email we receive.

We also use email addresses and mailing addresses to send updates about various ministry activities.  To exclude yourself from any of these mailings, electronic or postal, please call us at (877) 478-0100, email us at [info@pfm.org](mailto:info@pfm.org), or write to us at 1856 Old Reston Ave., Reston, VA  20190.  (You may also opt out of electronic mailings by clicking the unsubscribe link included in each mailing.)

Back to top.

**Cookies and Other Automatic Information**

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site.  For example, we analyze how many people visit each area of the site, how long they stay, the type of browsers that are being used, how many people click on various Web promotions.

Our email newsletter software tracks people subscribing or unsubscribing from each email newsletter, who opens email messages we send (if your computer supports such capabilities), and who clicks on which links in the email.  In general, we use this information only in aggregate to analyze the success of email campaigns.  However, we may at times target email newsletters based on this activity.

Like many sites, we use “cookies” to help analyze our Web site traffic.  Cookies are small identifying tags that we transfer to your computer through your Web browser.  They do not provide us with any personal information about you.  We use them to track how many times people visit our sites – whether most people come once / week, once / month, or are first-time visitors.  We analyze this data in aggregate, not at an individual level.  If you choose not to accept cookies, it will not affect your experience at our site.

**Agents**

We contract with companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include sending email newsletters, shipping products, maintaining databases, and sending mail.  These third parties use your information only to fulfill the task we have hired them to perform.

Back to top.

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**

Occasionally, we share the addresses of donors who have not given to the ministry in over two years with other like-minded ministries.  To exclude your information from ever being shared, please call us at (877) 478-0100, email us at [info@pfm.org](mailto:info@pfm.org) or write to us at 1856 Old Reston Ave., Reston, VA  20190.

Also, from time to time we acquire details about people who are in our database from third parties to enhance the data we already have. 

Back to top.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  PF uses Internet Encryption Software, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. Any information you enter is encrypted at your browser, sent over the public Internet in encrypted form, and then de-encrypted at our server. Once we receive your credit card information, it is accessible only to a small number of trusted PF staff that have been specially trained in processing this information.

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we know are under 13, and no part of our website is designed to attract anyone under 13.

Back to top.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

You can access your personally identifiable information, make corrections, or request that this information be removed from our system by calling us at (877) 478-0100.
