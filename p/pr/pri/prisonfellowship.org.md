#### Cookies and Other Automatic Information

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site. For example, we analyze how many people visit each area of the site, how long they stay, the type of browsers that are being used, certain demographic and affinity information, how many people click on various Web promotions. This information is collected primarily through Google Analytics. If you do not wish for this information to be captured, please sign out of all Google accounts prior to visiting the website. You can also opt-out of all Google Analytics features, for all sites, via their [opt-out tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

Our email newsletter software tracks people subscribing or unsubscribing from each email newsletter, who opens email messages we send (if your computer supports such capabilities), and who clicks on which links in the email. In general, we use this information only in aggregate to analyze the success of email campaigns. However, we may at times target email newsletters based on this activity.

Like many sites, we use “cookies” to help analyze our Web site traffic. Cookies are small identifying tags that we transfer to your computer through your Web browser. They do not provide us with any personal information about you. We use them to track how many times people visit our sites – whether most people come once / week, once / month, or are first-time visitors. We analyze this data in aggregate, not at an individual level. If you choose not to accept cookies, it will not affect your experience at our site.
