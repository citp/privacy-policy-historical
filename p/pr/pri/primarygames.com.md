We care about children and understand that they have special privacy needs. Therefore, we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children:

We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent.

When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, the virtual worlds we partner with will only use the online contact information (such as email) to: 

  1. Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes. Once we have responded to such request we will delete the information provided immediately.

  2. Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification.

  3. Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the child for other purposes. We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity.
