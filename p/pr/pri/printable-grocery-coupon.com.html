<p><strong>Effective and Last Updated: </strong>5/28/2011</p>
<p>This website is owned and operated by GCF Web Holdings, LLC<strong>. </strong> We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site (the “Site”).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link.&nbsp; Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp; Information Collected</strong></p>
<p>We collect two types of information from you: i) information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or emails); and ii) information that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntary Registration Information.</p>
<p>In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete the registration process, during which we will collect personal information about you. The information will include your name, address, and email address and any other personal or detailed information about yourself that will be shown in your personal profile. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide such information to us on a voluntary basis such as through our opt in newsletter.</p>
<p>By registering with us (submitting your name, email address, and zip code), you consent to the use and method of disclosure as described in this Privacy&nbsp;Policy.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntary Information for Services and Features</p>

When you choose to use these additional features, we require you to provide your “Contact Information” in addition to other personal information that may be required to complete a transaction such as your phone number, billing and shipping addresses and credit card information.&nbsp; Occasionally, we may also request information such as your shopping preferences and demographics which will help us better serve you and our others users in the future. We will not sell, rent, or share your personal information for marketing purposes without your consent.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies</p>
<p>Our site uses “cookies” and other tracking technologies.&nbsp; Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.&nbsp; Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user’s system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user’s information while they are away from their computer.</p>
<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.</p>
