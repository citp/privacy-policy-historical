In 2016, Printerland.co.uk renewed its partnership with Sale Sharks Rugby Union Club by sponsoring the Family Stand at the AJ Bell Stadium. As long-time supporters of Sale Sharks the company sponsored the famous Cheadle end of the club's previous home ground Edgely Park and were part of the corporate family that helped to build sell-out crowds and a premiership winning team in 2006.

Printerland.co.uk co-owner Graham Vickers commented, "It's great to be back involved with Sale Sharks. We do a lot of work with our local community and schools in the region and we look forward to extending our partnership with the Sharks to support these projects and introduce Rugby to a new audience that may not previously have had the chance to attend a match."
