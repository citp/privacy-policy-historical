# Privacy Policy

Effective July 13, 2013 

This document is our Privacy Policy, which describes the information we collect and how it is used. This Privacy Policy applies to all interactions with PriceZombie.com. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with PriceZombie will constitute your agreement to our policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use our services. Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User Agreement, and by using the site you agree to both. 

##### Privacy is a Right

Privacy is not a gift we give to you. You have a right to privacy. We take that right seriously here at PriceZombie. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Some price tracking and comparison sites serve two masters - they provide users with the information they want, while tracking the users shopping habits and selling that information to merchants. YOU are PriceZombie's only customer. PriceZombie has a strict policy not to share, rent or sell data to anyone without your electronic consent. 

##### Your Private Information is Never For Sale

Unless compelled by law to divulge information, we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information collected about our users to any third party. Anonymous, aggregated information that cannot be linked back to an individual user may be made available to third parties in order to provide better services. For example, if data shows an increase in visitors from a special interest site, we may use that information to invite the participation of more stores that would interest that demographic. 

##### The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the PriceZombie.com website, our extensions and bookmarklet.

##### Information Collection

PriceZombie requests personally identifiable information from you, including contact information such as your e-mail address, if you register to opt in to services such as our WatchList and Price Protection Notification. We need your email address to send you a notification if the product you are watching has dropped in price. We do not spam your email or sell your email address. Our extensions work by identifying products when you connect to our supported retailers. For that reason our extensions need to "see" the web pages you visit. If the url does not match that of a supported retailer, the program ignores that page. It does not save or transmit any information. If the url is the same as a product page on a supported retailer, our indexer will check if we have price history for the product. We publish the results in the form of price history graphs and price comparisons for you to view. 

##### Our Supported Retailers.

PriceZombie helps you find deals. PriceZombie does not sell products. If you click a link on PriceZombie and want to purchase an item from a supported retailer, please take the time to carefully review their Privacy Policy. Transactions occur between you and the retailer. PriceZombie is not responsible for information you provide retailers or what they do with that information. 

##### Promotional Communications

PriceZombie uses Twitter and Facebook to send communications on products, services, special deals, promotions and news. You can also find us on GooglePlus and Reddit.com. Just click on the link icons at the bottom of our home page, and unfriend us when you no longer wish to see our communications. 

##### Customer Service

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming e-mail to verify your signup. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, and when the items in your watchlist or price protection list meet price drop criteria. 

##### Email Address Verification

When you register we will send you an email in order to verify your email address really is yours. If you lose your password and want to reset it, we will send an email with instructions to the verified email you used at registration. 

##### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our sites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. 

##### Analytics Cookies

We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our website. It tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as how the site was accessed, how long visitors stayed, and the number of first-time visitors to the site. By knowing how people use the site, we can make it better. No personal information is transmitted to Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics and how it uses your data, please visit <http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html>. 

##### Disabling Cookies

Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones. However, if you do this, portions of the PriceZombie website may not function as intended. 

##### Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

##### Children Under 13

Although we welcome users from all walks of life, our site is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us. 

##### Changes To This Policy

We reserve the right to change this policy to meet the changing needs of PriceZombie, or for any other reason. If we make changes, we will notify our users. Where the changes substantially alters your rights, notice will appear prominently on your front page. More minor changes may only be highlighted by the privacy policy link in the footer of our website.
