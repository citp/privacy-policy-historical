# privacy policy

Your privacy is important to us. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998). 

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service. This may include passing your details to our vendors for them to send your order to you, and also passing your details to delivery companies so that they can deliver your parcel. 

The type of information we will collect about you includes: 

  * your name
  * address
  * phone number
  * e-mail address
  * credit/debit card details



We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by visiting our "Accounts Settings" page once you login or by emailing us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly. The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law and the Safebuy Code of Practice. If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first. 

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way cannot be used to identify you. If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should e-mail us at [contactus@printerinks.com](mailto:contactus@printerinks.com). 

**UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL EMAIL / SPAM**

We will not send any unsolicited commercial email (also known as spam) to personal email addresses and all marketing emails will include details of how to opt-out / unsubscribe. You may also send e-mails to contactus@printerinks.com with a request to be removed. 

**SECURITY**

Printerinks.com takes precautions to protect its customers' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. 

When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software currently available in the industry - SSL. Printerinks.com uses the most advanced form of SSL software available: 128-bit encryption by VeriSign. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/ "PayPal"). 

Access to all of our users' information is restricted. Printerinks.com operates in a secured and locked facility that requires all employees to check in and wear valid ID badges. Security cameras are positioned throughout the building in conjunction with multiple alarm systems. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We do not store your financial information in our system. 

All Printerinks.com servers, including web servers and database servers, are housed and maintained in secure locations. Access to the database is strictly monitored and protected from outside access. Internet access is restricted and protected by multiple Checkpoint and Cisco firewalls and password protection. The servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secured environment, inside a secured and locked room. All backups are stored and locked in a high-level security room. Only personnel with proper security clearance have access to these restricted areas. Tape backups are not permitted to leave the premises without prior authorization. 

All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, in addition to any time a new policy is added, Printerinks.com employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of privacy and what they can do to ensure that customers' information remains protected at all times. 

If you have any questions or concerns about Printerinks.com's security practices, you can send us an email at contactus@printerinks.com.
