**SECURITY**

PrinterPix takes precautions to protect its customers' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.   


When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software currently available in the industry - SSL. Printerpix.com uses the most advanced form of SSL software available: 128-bit encryption by VeriSign. To learn more about SSL, follow this link www.verisign.com.   


Access to all of our users' information is restricted. PrinterPix operates in a secured and locked facility that requires all employees to check in. Security cameras are positioned throughout the building in conjunction with multiple alarm systems. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We do not store your financial information in our system so for future transactions, you will be required to re-enter your information.   


All PrinterPix servers, including web servers and database servers, are housed and maintained in secure locations. Access to the database is strictly monitored and protected from outside access. Internet access is restricted and protected by multiple Checkpoint and Cisco firewalls and password protection. The servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secured environment, inside a secured and locked room. All backups are stored and locked in a high-level security room. Only personnel with proper security clearance have access to these restricted areas. Tape backups are not permitted to leave the premises without prior authorization.   


All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, in addition to any time a new policy is added, PrinterPix employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of privacy and what they can do to ensure that customers' information remains protected at all times.
