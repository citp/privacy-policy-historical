Printroom.com has a firm commitment to ensuring the privacy of our customers. This page will provide you with Printroom's (www.printroom.com) information gathering and dissemination practices. 

Printroom has adopted this Privacy Statement to explain what personal information we need, why we need it and how we protect it. The information we collect about you is used to process your order efficiently and to provide you with a personalized and enjoyable online experience. Details about our privacy policy are described below. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

Security  
Printroom utilizes technology, security features, and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of our customer information. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server and secure server software (SSL)-based encryption of all information you input. In addition, all customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

Your Printroom Account  
When you sign up with Printroom, you establish a password-protected personal account for storing your digital images and managing print orders and other services. You and you alone control who may view the images stored in your Printroom account.

Information Collection and Use  
When you create a new customer profile, we ask for your name, company, mailing address, and e-mail address. When you place an order, we ask for your credit card number and card expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. Once an online order has been confirmed, credit card information is not reused.

We may use the information we collect to periodically notify you about important changes to the Web site, new Printroom products and services, and special offers that may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us at support@printroom.com.. 

Protecting your photos  
Only you decide if and when your photographs are shared. We are committed to keeping your photographs private and secure. Your photographs are never made publicly accessible, and are shared only by your explicit action. 

Use of "Cookies"  
Printroom uses cookies (small pieces of information that are stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive) to recall your email address and other information stored in your customer profile. For example, our Online Store uses cookies to remember the contents of your shopping cart as you make your selections, and to recall your billing address. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features of our site.

Disclosure  
Printroom does not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to others (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process). If Printroom decides to change this practice we will ask for your express permission prior to conveying your personal information to a third-party. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

Children under 13  
Printroom takes children's privacy seriously. Printroom does not seek to collect personal information about children through any of its web sites. If a child submits information through any part of our website and we know that the person submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. 

Surveys and Contests  
From time to time, you may have the opportunity to enter a contest or fill out a customer survey. We may ask you for personal or demographic information such as your name, gender, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify the winner. We may also ask questions about your camera such as you camera's make and model, and your use of digital images.
