For example, you may establish criteria for the types of marketing communications and offers you wish to receive (i.e., Travel & Hotels, Dining, Shopping, Sports, Attractions, Entertainment).  

In order to send you these marketing communications, we use your personal data such as your name, e-mail address, and preferences.  You can, at any time and free of charge, choose not to receive any notifications by utilizing the unsubscribe functionality within the e-mail or SMS sent to you, or by e-mailing us using: [pricelessarabia@mastercard.com](mailto:pricelessarabia@mastercard.com).

We may collect certain information by automated means (e.g., cookies, log-file, web beacons) when you participate in Priceless Arabia.  The data collected automatically are processed in order to improve Priceless Arabia, perform data analyses to assess the use of Priceless Arabia and any interaction with other sites (e.g. social media sites), and to provide you with the best information and services.  The information we collect in this way tells us, for example, how many users visited our website and the pages accessed, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and helps us to identify features in which you may have the greatest interest.  This information also allows us to make improvements and to enhance your experience.

 _Log files and IP addresses_

:  Log files are web server files (containing information such as the domain name or IP address, URL, the http response code, the website from where you visit us or the date and duration of your visit) that are automatically created when an Internet user visits a site.  An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.  When you visit the Site, we may collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.  For example, when you request a page from the Site, our servers log your IP address.  In combination with other data, this information helps us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what types of offers our customers like to see.  In addition, log files help us to detect disruptions to telecommunication equipment and to detect abuse of our services.

We have engaged The Entertainer FZ LLC to source for offers and experiences. When you select an offer and experience, you may be brought to The Entertainer FZ LLC’s website to redeem the offer and experience. The Entertainer FZ LLC will be processing personal data for its own purposes under the terms of the agreement MasterCard has with The Entertainer FZ LLC in the context of Priceless Arabia, and we invite you to read [The Entertainer’s Privacy Notice](http://www.theentertainerme.com/privacy-and-cookies) for more information on its privacy practices. In addition, other merchants may provide offers and experiences to you directly, and any collection or use of personal data by those merchants will be subject to those merchants’ privacy notice.

If you have an enquiry or complaint in relation to a particular offer or experience, we may route your enquiry or complaint (and hence personal data contained in the enquiry or complaint e.g., name, email address, phone number, the subject of your complaint) to the relevant merchant or The Entertainer FZ LLC (where The Entertainer FZ LLC had sourced for the offer or experience) in order for them to respond to the enquiry or complaint.

In addition, we may disclose personal data about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, (ii) in response to a request from a court, law enforcement authorities or government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual criminal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any data we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will endeavor to use reasonable efforts to seek that the transferee uses the personal data you have provided through Priceless Arabia in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

The transfer of personal data outside of your country may be subject to restrictions.  If we transfer personal data outside of your country, we take all the necessary steps to ensure compliance with applicable data protection law, in particular, the legal requirements on adequate protection for data transfers to countries outside of your country.

**5.  Links to Other Websites**

On the Site, we provide links to other websites for your convenience.  In particular, Priceless Arabia offers you the possibility to share, link to or mention on social media outlets, such as Facebook or Twitter, anything you may find of interest.   These sites operate independently from Priceless Arabia and are not under our control.  These sites may have their own privacy policies in place, which we strongly suggest you review when you visit them.  We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, the data processing activities that are conducted via those sites, or any other use of these sites.

**6.  Data Security**

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the personal data in our possession.  

When you provide personal data online, we use the industry standard for encryption on the Internet  – Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology – to help protect the information that you provide.  This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your device to our server.  You will know that you are in a secure area of the Site when a lock icon appears on your screen that the “http” prefix of our URL address changes to “https. ”  The “s” represents “secure”.  We also use digital certificates to ensure that you are connected to the authentic Site.

Please note however that no collection or data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any data transmission.

We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence, such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).  If you believe your user name and password have been compromised, please contact us by following the instructions provided in the section "How to Contact Us" below.
