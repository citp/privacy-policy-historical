We will not share your personal data with anyone else unless you agree to this, or such sharing is necessary to fulfil our contract with you, or we are legally allowed or required to do so. Moreover, your personal data will only be shared with selected organisations which comply with our security procedures and policies. Organisations we may share your personal data with include: 

  * Another member of our group of companies where they help provide or improve our services to you; 
  * Our service providers and subcontractors, where they us help provide our services to you;

  * A regulating body or other authority where we need to comply with a regulatory or legal obligation;

Where your Priority Pass membership is a benefit of your payment card issuer (such as your bank), we may share your personal data with that card issuer and the payment card brand associated with that card. 

Some of those organisations may be based in a country outside the European Economic Area or where different data privacy laws apply. We will only transfer your personal data to that country if they ensure an adequate level of protection of your rights and freedoms, or you have given us your consent, or that organisation is contractually bound to meet European Economic Area data protection law. We will not sell your personal data to anyone.

  4. **Personal data protection and storage**



We handle your personal data in accordance with adequate and reasonable procedures and technologies in order to maintain and protect its security, availability, confidentiality and integrity, and prevent its unlawful or unauthorised processing, accidental loss or damage, from its collection until its destruction. Where personal data is transmitted across the internet, it will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of your personal data, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

  5. **Personal data disposal and retention**



We will only keep your personal data for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected and we will remove from our systems all personal data which is no longer required. We will only retain your personal data after this time where we are required to do so, in order to meet a regulatory or legal obligation.
