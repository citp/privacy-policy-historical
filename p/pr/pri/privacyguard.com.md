**OUR OBJECTIVE**  
Your Personal Information is important to our business and vital in serving your needs. We are committed to the responsible collection, management, disclosure, safekeeping, and use of such information. This Privacy Policy guides us in achieving that commitment and applies to all of our members and other customers in the United States. In order to remind you of our commitment, we will send you a copy of our Privacy Policy at least annually following our initial notice. 

**PERSONAL INFORMATION COVERED BY POLICY**  
By "Personal Information," we mean information we possess about you that identifies you personally and is not otherwise available to the public. This information may include general information (such as your name, address, phone number, birth date and Social Security number), transaction information (such as your service usage and products purchased through us) and financial information (such as income). 

**COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We may obtain your Personal Information from you or from third parties. We may collect such information from applications or other forms submitted by you, from your transactions with us, our affiliates or other parties, or from other sources. 

**OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We use Personal Information to help us serve our members and other customers and to conduct our business. We use such information to perform business functions, such as servicing our members and other customers, paying claims and benefit amounts, advising our members and other customers of our existing products and services, and developing new products and services. 

**SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH AFFILIATES**  
We may provide Personal Information relating to your transactions with us or our experience with you to our affiliates (including those existing currently or in the future).

We may also share Personal Information with (x) unaffiliated third parties, including marketing partners, printers, billing agents, insurance companies, administrators and service providers, that assist us in performing our business functions and marketing our products, and as otherwise permitted or required by law, and (y) unaffiliated financial institutions under joint marketing agreements with us; in any such case, we will require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of Personal Information disclosed to them. 

We may also share Personal Information with certain other unaffiliated third parties, including non-financial service providers (such as retailers, airlines, and publishers), so that they may offer you products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. You have the opportunity to direct that your Personal Information not be disclosed to these third parties by completing and returning the form presented below.

**MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**  
We have implemented security procedures which use reasonable measures to ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Information in our possession and guard against unauthorized access or use. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to safeguard Personal Information. We grant access to Personal Information only to those employees who need to use it in performing their job related duties and as otherwise set forth herein. Employees who violate our security procedures will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination. 

**TREATMENT OF INFORMATION OF FORMER MEMBERS AND CUSTOMERS**  
We will continue to follow our Privacy Policy for your Personal Information even when you are no longer a member or other customer of our business. 

**CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY**  
This Privacy Policy supersedes all privacy policies and other similar standards previously issued by us. This Privacy Policy is subject to updates and other changes from time to time. In the event of any such changes, we will notify all of our members and other customers of such changes in the manner and to the extent required by law.
