# PriceSCAN Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**  
PriceSCAN is committed to keeping any information we receive from our users private and secure. We believe that you have a right to know what information we collect, how we intend to use that information, whom we intend to share it with, and what measures we take to keep that information secure.   
**PriceSCAN Newsletter**  
PriceSCAN will not sell or publish any e-mail addresses submitted by subscribers to the PriceSCAN Newsletter. All e-mail addresses will be kept strictly confidential.   
**Type of Information Collected**  
PriceSCAN users may submit their e-mail addresses to request that an e-mail message be sent to them when an item reaches a specified target price. These addresses are maintained in our database until the one-time message is sent, and for some time afterwards (not more than 60 days).   
E-mail addresses submitted to "Recommend This Product" via forms provided on the PriceSCAN website are maintained in the database for a short period of time (not more than 60 days) and are also displayed in the e-mail message which is sent out (to discourage "spamming").   
PriceSCAN uses cookies to monitor traffic on our website. ([More about cookies here](https://web.archive.org/cookies.asp)) PriceSCAN’s webserver also uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems and for other tasks associated with routine website administration, but this information is not collated for identification purposes.  
**Uses and Sharing of Information**  
PriceSCAN uses e-mail addresses solely for the purposes specified by the users submitting them, that is, to accompany a review submitted for positing on PriceSCAN, to address an e-mail message (by request) when an item reaches a target price, or to address an e-mail message to recommend a certain product. PriceSCAN never shares e-mail addresses with any third parties, including advertisers or partners.  
**Security Measures**  
PriceSCAN has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Access to computer data and files at PriceSCAN is secured by password coding, and our network is designed to prevent unauthorized access.  
**Questions?**  
PriceSCAN welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure. Any revisions to our policy will be posted to this site. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [feedback@pricescan.com](mailto:feedback@pricescan.com).
