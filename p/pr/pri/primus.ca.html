      <p class="bold">PRIVACY POLICY</p>

      <p class="boldblue">This Policy describes Primus Canada's collection, use 

        and/or disclosure of personal information. It governs the behavior of 

        employees and agents acting on Primus Canada's behalf when dealing with 

        personal information. It provides procedures for an individual's access 

        to and correction of personal information.</p>

      <p>Personal information includes information about an identifiable individual, 

        presented in any form, such as: age, name, ID number(s), income, ethnic 

        origin, opinions, evaluations, social status, disciplinary actions, credit 

        records, loan records, medical records.</p>

      <p>Personal information does not include the name, title or business address 

        <br>

        or telephone number of an employee of an organization.</p>

      <p>Primus Canada's Privacy Policy is enacted pursuant to the Personal Information 

        Protection and Electronic Documents Act*, and is effective as of January 

        1, 2001.</p>

      <p>This Primus Canada Privacy Policy is organized along ten privacy principles**, 

        which are:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p class="bold">&nbsp;1. Accountability<br>

          &nbsp;2. Identifying Purposes<br>

          &nbsp;3. Consent<br>

          &nbsp;4. Limiting Collection<br>

          &nbsp;5. Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention<br>

          &nbsp;6. Accuracy<br>

          &nbsp;7. Safeguards<br>

          &nbsp;8. Openness<br>

          &nbsp;9. Individual Access<br>

          10. Challenging Compliance</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #1 -- ACCOUNTABILITY</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Primus Canada is responsible for personal information 

        under its control and shall designate an individual or individuals who 

        are accountable for the organization's compliance with the following principles.</p>

      <p>1.1 Accountability for Primus Canada's compliance with the principles 

        rests with the senior management of Primus Canada and the person or persons 

        designated by senior management as Privacy Officer, even though other 

        individuals within the organization may be responsible for the day-to-day 

        collection and processing of personal information. In addition, other 

        individuals within the organization may be delegated to act on behalf 

        of senior management or the Privacy Officer.</p>

      <p>1.2 Primus Canada's senior management has designated the following person 

        to act as Privacy Officer to oversee the organization's compliance with 

        the principles:</p>

      
<blockquote> 

        
<p class="boldblue">Attention: <br>

          Primus Canada's Legal Department<br>

          Fax (416) 207-7754</p>

        </blockquote>

      <p>1.3 Primus Canada is responsible for personal information in its possession 

        or custody, including information that has been transferred to a third 

        party for processing. Primus Canada shall use contractual or other means 

        to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being 

        processed by a third party.</p>

      <p>1.4 Primus Canada shall implement policies and practices to give effect 

        to the principles, including:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>(a) implementing procedures to protect personal information;<br>

          (b) establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and 

          inquiries;<br>

          (c) training staff and communicating to staff information about Primus 

          Canada's policies and practices; and<br>

          (d) developing information to explain Primus Canada's policies and procedures.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #2 - IDENTIFYING PURPOSES</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Primus Canada shall identify the purposes for which 

        personal information is collected at or before the time the information 

        is collected.</p>

      <p>2.1 Primus Canada collects personal information only for the following 

        purposes ("identified purposes"):</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>(a) to provide service(s) and/or products to its customers;<br>

          (b) to maintain commercial relations and to communicate with its customers 

          (which shall include, but not be limited to: billing, collection, advertising, 

          promotion, account verification);<br>

          (c) to identify customer needs and/or preferences;<br>

          (d) to meet legal and regulatory requirements;<br>

          (e) to administer and manage its business operations</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>2.2 Primus Canada will provide notice of the identified purposes either 

        orally, electronically or writing prior to or at the time of collection 

        of the personal information. </p>

      <p>2.3 Persons collecting personal information shall be able to explain 

        to individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected, 

        or shall refer the individual to a designated person at Primus Canada 

        who shall explain the purposes.</p>

      <p>2.4 When personal information that has been collected is to be used for 

        a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose shall be identified 

        prior to use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, Primus Canada 

        shall obtain the consent of the individual before information is used 

        for that new purpose.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #3 - CONSENT</p>

      <p class="boldblue">The knowledge and consent of the individual are required 

        for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except 

        where inappropriate.</p>

      <p>3.1 In certain circumstances, personal information can be collected, 

        used, or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. 

        For example, legal, medical or security reasons may make it impossible 

        or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for 

        the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking 

        the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the 

        information. Seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when there 

        is an emergency threatening the individual's life, health or security, 

        or where the individual is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated. 

        In other instances, information may be publicly available. Moreover, Primus 

        Canada may provide personal information to its lawyer or agent to collect 

        a debt, comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, government 

        institution requesting the information upon lawful authority, or as may 

        be otherwise required by law.</p>

      <p>3.2 Primus Canada will generally seek consent for the use or disclosure 

        of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, 

        consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information 

        has been collected but before use (for example, when Primus Canada wants 

        to use information for a purpose not previously identified).</p>

      <p>3.3 Primus Canada shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the individual 

        is advised of the purposes for which the information will be used. To 

        make the consent meaningful, the purposes shall be stated in such a manner 

        that the individual can reasonably understand how the information will 

        be used or disclosed.</p>

      <p>3.4 Primus Canada shall not, as a condition of the supply of a product 

        or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use, or 

        disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfil the explicitly 

        specified and legitimate purposes.</p>

      <p>3.5 The form of consent sought by Primus Canada may vary, depending upon 

        the circumstances and the type of information disclosed. In determining 

        the form of consent to use, Primus Canada shall take into account the 

        sensitivity of the information and the reasonable expectations of the 

        individual. An authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or 

        a person having power of attorney) can also give consent. </p>

      <p>Primus Canada will seek express consent when the information is likely 

        to be considered sensitive. </p>

      <p class="boldblue">Implied consent will generally be appropriate when the 

        information is less sensitive. The use of services or products by a customer 

        or the acceptance of employment by an employee shall be considered implied 

        consent to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified 

        purposes. </p>

      <p>3.6 An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal 

        or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Primus Canada shall 

        inform the individual of the implications of such withdrawal. In order 

        to withdraw consent, an individual must provide notice to Primus Canada 

        in writing.</p>

      <p class="boldblue">3.7 With respect to personal information already collected 

        by Primus Canada prior to the publication of this Privacy Policy, this 

        Policy shall constitute reasonable notice to Primus Canada's current customers 

        and employees of the purposes and uses for which such personal information 

        has been collected. Should an individual object to these ongoing uses 

        or disclosures, consent may be withdrawn upon providing notice to Primus 

        Canada in writing.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #4 - LIMITING COLLECTION</p>

      <p class="boldblue">The collection of personal information shall be limited 

        to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by Primus Canada. 

        Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means.</p>

      <p>4.1 Primus Canada collects personal information from its customers and 

        employees for the purposes described under Principle #2. </p>

      <p>4.2 Primus Canada may also collect personal information from such third 

        parties as credit bureaus, employers or personal references or other third 

        parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the information.</p>

      <p>4.3 In connection with its Internet business, Primus Canada may use a 

        'Cookie' to collect certain information which it uses to track user patterns 

        on its web site(s). A Cookie is a text file containing a unique identification 

        number that identifies a user's browser, but not a particular individual. 

        A Cookie does not identify an individual. Furthermore, Primus Canada does 

        not use Cookies in combination with other information to obtain personally 

        identifiable information. If an individual does not wish to use Cookies, 

        he or she can re-set their browser to either provide notification or refuse 

        to accept Cookies.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #5 - LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, AND RETENTION</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Personal information shall not be used or disclosed 

        for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with 

        the consent of the individual or as required by law. Personal information 

        shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those 

        purposes.</p>

      <p>5.1 Primus Canada may collect, use or disclose personal information without 

        the individual's knowledge or consent in certain circumstances as described 

        in Principle #3.1.</p>

      <p>5.2 Primus Canada may disclose a customer's personal information to:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>(a) another telecommunication company for the provision of telecommunications 

          services to that customer;<br>

          (b) a company involved in providing communications directory services;<br>

          (c) a person involved in the development, promotion, marketing or enhancement 

          of Primus Canada services;<br>

          (d) a credit collections agency;<br>

          (e) emergency services in an emergency situation;<br>

          (f) a person, who, in the reasonable estimation of Primus Canada, is 

          an agent of the customer;<br>

          (g) any other third party, upon receiving the consent of the customer 

          or as required by law.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>5.3 Primus Canada may disclose an employee's personal information in 

        the following circumstances:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>(a) in the administration of that employee's benefits;<br>

          (b) in providing references to prospective employers, upon receiving 

          the consent of the employee;<br>

          (c) as may be required by law.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>5.4 Certain Primus Canada employees may be given access to customer and/or 

        employee information in so far as their duties require access for business 

        purposes. Primus Canada employees are governed by a non-disclosure agreement 

        prohibiting disclosure or use of any confidential or personal information 

        for any purposes other than the stated business purposes.</p>

      <p>5.5 Primus Canada shall retain personal information for only as long 

        as required to fulfil the identified purposes or as required by law.</p>

      <p>5.6 Personal information that is no longer required to fulfil the identified 

        purposes shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous according to the 

        guidelines and procedures established by Primus Canada.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #6 - ACCURACY</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Personal information shall be as accurate, complete, 

        and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be 

        used.</p>

      <p>6.1 The extent to which personal information shall be accurate, complete, 

        and up-to-date will depend upon the use of the information, taking into 

        account the interests of the individual. Information shall be sufficiently 

        accurate, complete, and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate 

        information may be used to make a decision about the individual.</p>

      <p>6.2 Primus Canada shall not routinely update personal information unless 

        such a process is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information 

        was collected.</p>

      <p>6.3 Personal information that is used on an ongoing basis, including 

        information that is disclosed to third parties, should generally be accurate 

        and up-to-date, unless limits to the requirement for accuracy are clearly 

        set out.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #7 - SAFEGUARDS</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Personal information shall be protected by security 

        safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</p>

      <p>7.1 Primus Canada shall protect personal information against loss or 

        theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. 

        The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of 

        the information that has been collected, the amount, distribution and 

        format of the information, and the method of storage. </p>

      <p>7.2 Primus Canada protects all personal information regardless of the 

        format in which it is held. The methods of protection include:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>(a) physical measures, such as locked filing cabinets and restricted 

          access to offices;<br>

          (b) organizational measures, such as security clearances and limiting 

          access on a "need to know" basis;<br>

          (c) technological measures, such as the use of passwords and encryption.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>7.3 Primus Canada makes their employees aware of the importance of maintaining 

        the confidentiality of personal information. Primus Canada employees are 

        governed by a non-disclosure agreement prohibiting disclosure or use of 

        any confidential or personal information for any purposes other than the 

        stated business purposes.</p>

      <p>7.4 Primus Canada shall use care in the disposal or destruction of personal 

        information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the 

        information.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #8 - OPENNESS</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Primus Canada shall make readily available to individuals 

        specific information about its policies and practices relating to the 

        management of personal information.</p>

      <p>8.1 Primus Canada shall make its policies and practices with respect 

        to the management of personal information easily comprehensible and accessible,

      <p>8.2 Primus Canada will make this Privacy Policy available online, by 

        mail, or in a brochure format at its place of business. Furthermore, Primus 

        Canada's Customer Services Representatives shall be trained to answer

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #9 - INDIVIDUAL ACCESS</p>

      <p class="boldblue">Upon request, an individual shall be informed of the 

        existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information and 

        shall be given access to that information. An individual shall be able 

        to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have 

        it amended as appropriate.</p>

      <p>9.1 Upon request, Primus Canada shall inform an individual whether or 

        not the organization holds personal information about the individual, 

        and shall provide that individual with a reasonable opportunity to review 

        the personal information in his or her file. </p>

      <p>9.2 Primus Canada shall allow the individual access to his or her personal 

        information once the individual has provided Primus Canada with a written 

        request application. Primus Canada shall make the application available 

        to customers through Customer Service Representatives and to employees 

        through the Human Resources Department. The application shall include 

        sufficient information to permit Primus Canada to provide an account of 

        the existence, use, and disclosure to any third parties of this personal 

        information. Primus Canada shall use the application only for this purpose.</p>

      <p>9.3 Primus Canada shall respond to an application for individual access 

        to personal information within a reasonable time and at minimal or no 

        cost to the individual. The requested information shall be provided or 

        made available in a form that is generally understandable.</p>

      <p>9.4 Primus Canada shall be as specific as possible in providing an account 

        of third parties to which it has disclosed personal information about 

        an individual. When it is not possible to provide a list of the organizations 

        to which it has actually disclosed information about an individual, Primus 

        Canada shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed 

        information about the individual.</p>

      <p>9.5 In certain instances, Primus Canada will not be able to provide the 

        individual access to his or her personal information. For example, Primus 

        Canada will not provide access to information where the information requested 

        is prohibitively costly to provide; where the information contains references 

        to other individuals; where the information cannot be disclosed for legal, 

        security or commercial proprietary reasons; where the information is subject 

        to solicitor-client or litigation privilege; or where the information 

        can best be available from another source (for example, through a medical 

        practitioner). In each case, Primus Canada will provide reasons for denying 

        any access to personal information.</p>

      <p>9.6 When an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness 

        of personal information, Primus Canada shall amend the information as 

        required. Depending upon the nature of the information challenged, amendment 

        involves the correction, deletion or addition of information. Where appropriate, 

        the amended information shall be transmitted to third parties having access 

        to the information in question.</p>

      <p>9.7 When a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual, 

        Primus Canada shall record the substance of the unresolved challenge. 

        When appropriate, the existence of the unresolved challenge shall be transmitted 

        to third parties having access to the information in question.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="bold">PRINCIPLE #10 - CHALLENGING COMPLIANCE</p>

      <p class="boldblue">An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning 

        compliance with the above principles to Primus Canada's Privacy Officer.</p>

      <p>10.1 Primus Canada shall maintain procedures to receive and respond to 

        complaints or inquiries about its policies and practices relating to the 

        handling of personal information. Primus Canada will make every effort 

        to ensure that its procedures are easily accessible and simple to use.</p>

      <p>10.2 Primus Canada shall inform individuals who make inquiries or lodge 

        complaints of the existence of relevant complaint procedures. </p>

      <p>10.3 The person or persons accountable for compliance with this Privacy 

        Policy may seek external advice where appropriate before providing a final 

        response to individual complaints.</p>

      <p>10.4 Primus Canada shall investigate all complaints. If a complaint is 

        found to be justified, Primus Canada shall take appropriate measures, 

        including, if necessary, amending its policies and practices.</p>
