We also describe generally FMNA’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.

_FMNA Collected Information_

• **Transactional and Site Activity Information**. When users access FMNA Services, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to FMNA Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access FMNA Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.

• **Cookies and Similar Technologies**. We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of FMNA Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. FMNA may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of FMNA Services to personal information obtained from you or from a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on FMNA Websites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. FMNA may use persistent cookies that stay on your browser into the future until they expire or you delete them as well as session cookies that usually are erased when you close your browser window. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

• **Third Party Cookies and Similar Technologies.** Third parties that support FMNA Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect similar information. We may allow selected third parties to place cookies through our site to provide us with better insights into the use of the site or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our website. FMNA does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info.

• **Do not Track.** California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how FMNA responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. FMNA does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
