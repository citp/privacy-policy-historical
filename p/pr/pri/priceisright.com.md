We take precautions to ensure the security of personal information submitted by users. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take care to protect your personal information, FremantleMedia cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

We also store any personal information, including credit card numbers, in a secure area to which the general public does not have access.
