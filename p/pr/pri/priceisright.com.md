**5.        ****Disclosure of Your Data:**

Disclosure to Affiliates: We reserve the right to share Personal Data with our affiliates, partners, parent companies and subsidiaries.  If you do not want us to share your Personal Data with any such affiliated companies for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such sharing at any time by emailing FMNA at [privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com](mailto:privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com).

Disclosure to Third Parties: Like many businesses, FMNA may occasionally hire third parties to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf such as hosting specific portions of the Site, maintaining databases, delivering content, sending marketing emails, administering contests, mailing information, processing payments, or otherwise operating the Site (singularly “Third Party” or collectively, “Third Parties”).  When we employ a Third Party to perform these functions, that Third Party will only be provided with the particular Personal Data, cookies and/or IP addresses it needs to perform their function, and is required to protect such Personal Data, cookies and/or IP addresses.  With your consent, we may also share Personal Data with pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.  We will provide you with an opportunity to elect or decline these services or opportunities (see “Your Choices” below). In the event you have elected to “unsubscribe” from any of our services, we will share your Personal Data with third parties with who we jointly offer such services solely to the extent necessary to ensure that your request not to receive such communications is honored.  In addition, for third-party sponsored sweepstakes, contests or promotions, FMNA may request Personal Data from you that may be shared with such sponsor(s) upon their request, but we will give you the option to either agree to this use of your Personal Data or cancel your participation in the applicable sweepstakes, contest, or promotion at the time we request such Personal Data.

Disclosure to Others **:** In addition, FMNA may disclose Personal Data and IP addresses without providing you with a choice under the following limited circumstances to: (1) protect the legal rights, privacy or safety of FMNA, or their subsidiaries, affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors; (2) protect the safety and security of visitors to the Site or other properties; (3) protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes; (4) respond to inquiries or requests from public authorities; (5) permit FMNA to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that FMNA may sustain; (6) enforce our Terms of Use; or (7) comply with the law or legal process.

If FMNA sells all or part of the Site or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FMNA may, in its sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal Data and/or IP address information to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction.  Upon such transfer, the Privacy Policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your Personal Data and/or, IP address information.

**6.        ****Third-Party Advertising and Partnerships with Other Sites:**

The Site may include third-party advertising.  These third parties' online services, websites and advertisers, or the Internet advertising companies that work on their behalf, may use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on the Site directly to your computer.  They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.  They may also use certain technologies to deliver advertisements, collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other Personal Data).  For more information about these specialized technologies, and how to "opt out" of information collection by these companies, we suggest you visit the privacy policies and terms of use/service for these companies.

Please note that the Site may provide access to other partner experiences that will not follow the same Privacy Policy as the Site.  For instance, selecting an interface or other elements on the Site may take you to an entirely different online service controlled and operated by another company.  These other services may use our logos or sub-brands as a result of a co-branding agreement; however, these services may use their own methods of collecting data, including Personal Data, and may make use of that data in ways that the Site would not.  This Privacy Policy will not apply to Personal Data or any other data collected from or provided by you in connection with such partner experiences or partner services.  You should check the partner's applicable privacy policy to determine how that partner will handle such data.

**7.        ****Your Choices:**

You can use the certain features of the Site without providing any Personal Data, but if you decline to provide Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain services or features.  

If you have previously provided Personal Data to the Site and have subscribed to one or more email newsletters or are receiving emails or other communications from us and you do not want to receive such emails, please discontinue your subscriptions by emailing FMNA at [privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com](mailto:privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com). 

If you ask that we stop using your Personal Data, we will honor that request.  However, as stated above, you may not be able to continue using certain features of the Site that require Personal Data, and we will retain records of your Personal Data as needed in order to comply with applicable federal, state, or local law.

**8.        ****  Privacy and Children**

**If you are under the age of 18, please be sure to read this Privacy Policy with your parent/guardian and obtain their permission before you submit or post any Personal Data on the Site, and before you use any features or offerings of the Site.**

FMNA encourage parents and legal guardians to spend time with their age-appropriate children using the Site. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activities the Site may offer.  At various places on the Site, we may ask users for their age.  By using or logging into the Site or related features or services, you agree to respond truthfully and accurately about your age. 

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (commonly referred to as COPPA), FMNA does not requires children under the age of 13 to provide us with any more information than is reasonably necessary to participate and make use of this site and under no circumstances do we require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any personal information.  Children under the age of 13 should not submit or post any personal information without the written consent of their parents or legal guardians.  If you are a child under the age of 13 and want to submit your personal information to us, you should ask your parents to send an e-mail to [privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com](mailto:privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com)

Do not post your real name on the Site or in any other feature of the Site, and never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family, including your phone number and address.  Use your username at all times.  If you win a sweepstakes that has a prize, your parent will have to mail or fax us a signed note at the address or fax number listed in the rules for the specific contest that says it was OK for you to enter, and tells us they will accept the prize for you.  Some areas of the Site may have special rules for children under the age of 18.  When you are in those areas, you must follow those rules.

Parents and legal guardians may request to review and/or removal of their child's Personal Data at any time by emailing [privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com](mailto:privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com), which must include the same screen name, password, and e-mail address that their child submitted.  To protect the child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify the parent's or legal guardian's identity before granting him or her access to the child's Personal Data. 

**9.        ****Data Security Disclaimer**

We take reasonable security precautions to secure the Personal Data that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access of such information. Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure.  It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.  While we strive to protect your Personal Data, FMNA cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us.  Any such transmission is done at your own risk.  If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us of the problem by emailing [privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com](mailto:privacy.officer@fremantlemedia.com).

**10.    ****Exclusions**

This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us on or through the Site (" **Unsolicited Submissions** ").  Please see our Terms of Use for our policies regarding such Unsolicited Submissions.  All such Unsolicited Submissions shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such Unsolicited Submissions to others without limitation or attribution.

We reserves the right to change this policy at any time, and will post any changes to this policy as soon as they go into effect without prior notice to you.  Any such changes are effective as of the date such changes are posted on this page.  Please check this page periodically to view our most current Privacy Policy.
