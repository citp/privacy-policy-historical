Tracking technologies on the Services may be deployed by Prime Publishing and/or by our service providers or partners. Certain tracking technologies enable us to assign a unique identifier to you, and relate information about your use of the Services to other information about you, including your User Information. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including from third parties), including, but not limited to, demographic information and updated contact information, for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content and advertising.

When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with more focused email communications or other information, and/or to aggregate that information with other data we collect to use for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

We and our partners (including but not limited to e-commerce partners, affiliates, and analytics providers) also may use technologies such as pixel tags, e-tags, IP addresses, Local Shared Objects, Local Storage, Flash cookies and HTML5 to analyze trends; administer the Services; collect and store information such as user settings, anonymous browser identifiers and video viewing history; supplement our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement; track users’ location and movements around the Services; gather demographic information about our user base; and to improve our understanding of traffic on the Services, visitor behavior, and responses to promotional campaigns.

We may link this information to User Information.

Prime Publishing and/or certain third parties may collect information about you for online behavioral advertising ( **“OBA”** ) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising.

Prime Publishing displays ads on both the Services and on the Channels. We may use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.

**The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change.** Prime Publishing allows firms including [Google](http://www.google.com/), [LiveRamp](http://www.liveramp.com/), [Datonics](http://www.datonics.com/), and [Magnetic](http://www.magnetic.com/) to monitor Company web sites and newsletters for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisements, “click-throughs” and/or other activities. These firms may use cookies, web beacons and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about Company users. Users may go to each firm’s site/URL for information on what is being tracked. Users may go to each firm’s site for information on how to opt-in or opt-out of use of their information and may go to <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> to opt-out of most third-party tracking.

For a list of some of the applicable providers [click here](https://liveramp.uk/opt_out/). For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, [click here](https://liveramp.uk/opt_out/). For more details about OBA and opting out, see Section 15 below.

Online Data is aggregated with the Other Information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data and GeoIP Data, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using the Services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests. We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.

  * legal and regulatory authorities, upon request, or for the purposes of reporting any actual or suspected breach of applicable law or regulation;
  * outside professional advisors (such as accountants, auditors, or lawyers), subject to binding contractual obligations of confidentiality;
  * third party Processors (such as analytic providers; data centers; etc.), located anywhere in the world, subject to the requirements noted below in this Section 9;

  * any relevant third party acquirer(s), in the event that we sell or transfer all or any relevant portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation);
  * any relevant third party provider, where our Services use third party advertising, plugins or content. If you choose to interact with any such advertising, plugins or content, information about your activities on the Services and Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests may be shared with the relevant third party provider. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria;
  * any sponsors of contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, or content offerings, the registration data for such events is to be used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the sponsor and others, subject to this Policy and the sponsor’s privacy policy. We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events. For contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, please read the official rules or terms and conditions carefully before you submit your information; and
  * to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers). Under applicable law, we may share Other Information with other parties who already possess your Personal Information in order to enhance their records about you or enhance their ability to provide products and services.



For some of our Services, we may make some information, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer’s name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g., sale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with certain content available on our websites. Depending on where you reside, when you register for certain Services, we may share the Personal Information you provide with certain advertisers and sponsors.

Some of the Services may include websites that Prime Publishing operates on behalf of third parties ( **“Licensors”** ). Where applicable, we may share some or all of your Personal Information with the Licensor; however this privacy policy does not cover the user of your Personal Information by a Licensor. The privacy practices of Prime Publishing’s Licensors may differ from this policy and we encourage you to contact those third parties directly if you have questions regarding their use of your Personal Information. When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Prime Publishing), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected information back to that partner, which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services.

With respect to surveys and quizzes, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey or quiz. Otherwise we will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users’ responses in surveys or quizzes to other participants in the survey. Where surveys or quizzes allow users to submit written comments, and where Prime Publishing advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey or quiz, Prime Publishing reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.

Prime Publishing and some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.

We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.

We may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, including but not limited to monitoring fraud around the web.

We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them. We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier. Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine User Information about you received from Prime Publishing with information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

If we engage a third-party Processor to Process your User Information, the Processor will be subject to binding contractual obligations to: (i) only Process the User Information in accordance with our prior written instructions; and (ii) use measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the User Information; together with any additional requirements under applicable law.

The Services contain links to other sites or partners whose information practices may be different from ours. You should consult the privacy policy of these third parties to learn how your privacy is protected.

##### Summary — What Can I Do to Control My Information?

**You can directly take steps to change your preferences for newsletters and online behavioral advertising as outlined in this section.**

**If you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights including: the right not to provide your Personal Information to us; the right of access to your Personal Information; the right to request rectification of inaccuracies; the right to request the erasure, or restriction of Processing, of your Personal Information; the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information; the right to have your Personal Information transferred to another controller; the right to withdraw consent; and the right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities.

You may directly take steps to change your preferences as follows:

Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions. You can opt out or unsubscribe from a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list. If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.

Push Notifications. We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

Location Based Services. You may opt-out of having your Precise Location Data collected by Prime Publishing at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).

OBA. Prime Publishing strives to adhere to the self-regulatory organization principles for the DAA (US), the DAAC (Canada) and the EDAA (EU). Online ads on the Services using Online Data are delivered with the DAA Ad Marker Icon , which helps users understand how their data is being used and provides choices for users who want more control.

Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases). Requests should be submitted by contacting us (using the contact instructions in Section 17 below). If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.

**RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA USERS WITH REGARD TO THEIR INFORMATION**

California users have several rights regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of their information under the CCPA. One of these rights, notice of collection of Information, is described above; the balance of these rights are described below and include the following rights:

  * Disclosure of information collected and sold
  * Opt-out from the sale of Information
  * Deletion of Information
  * Access and portability of Information collected
  * Non-discrimination



**Exercising Your Rights, Verification and Timing.**

To request Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold, Right to Opt-Out and/or Deletion of Information or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:

_Website_ : You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/>

_Email_ : You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at [caprivacy@primecp.com](mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com).

**Response Timing and Format.** We aim to respond to a consumer request for access or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

To prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a user’s Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request). We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or abusive. We WILL require you to verify the requestor’s identity. This may include furnishing a notarized and signed attestation along with proof of identity (i.e. driver’s license, passport, state ID). A notary will identify the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity such as passport, driving license, etc. Original documents must be mailed, faxed or uploaded via details we will provide in response to any access related inquiry.

In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user. If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.

For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice. Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion. If, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision.

**Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.** While users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that sell Information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:

  * The categories and sources of Information collected;
  * Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;
  * The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;
  * The specific pieces of Information collected;
  * If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will disclose:
  * For sales – the Information categories for each category sold and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was sold; and
  * For disclosures – the Information categories for each category disclosed and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was disclosed



To request Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:

_Website_ : You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/>

_Email_ : You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at [caprivacy@primecp.com](mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com).

**Right to Opt-Out.** Users have the right to opt-out from the sale of their Information. We reserve the right to verify all opt-out requests using the methods described above.

While our agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California user’s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information. We will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out. If the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step process.

To request Right to Opt-Out or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:

_Website_ : You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/>

_Email_ : You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at [caprivacy@primecp.com](mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com).

**Deletion of Information.** You have the right to request that we delete any of your Information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request using the process set forth above, we will delete or deidentify (and direct our service providers, vendors and other applicable third parties to delete) your Information from our system other than from our archive servers (which we maintain for compliance purposes), unless there is an applicable exception.

We may decline to process your deletion request if the Information is necessary for us or our service providers, vendors or other applicable third parties for a number of reasons. The following are some of the reasons we may decline your deletion request:

  1. Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the goods or services you requested;
  2. Detect security incidents, protect, investigate and respond to malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
  3. Identify and correct errors that negatively impact intended functionality; and
  4. Comply with a legal obligation, including Federal and/or State tax liability and reporting.



If we do not comply with a deletion request, we will provide the grounds for our denial.

To request Deletion of Information or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:

_Website_ : You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/>

_Email_ : You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at [caprivacy@primecp.com](mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com).

**Access and Portability.** California users have the right to access the Information we have collected about them in the previous twelve (12) months. Upon receipt of verified consumer request, we will provide the information in a readily usable format. You cannot request access more than twice in any 12-month period.

**Nondiscrimination.** We are committed not to discriminate against California users who exercise their CCPA rights. As such, unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny, charge you different prices or rates, or provide a different quality level of goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, and/or suggest that you may receive a different price, rate, or quality level of goods or services. While we do not provide financial incentives for users who do not exercise their CCPA rights, please note that some of the functionality of our Website may be unavailable if consumers exercise their rights to have their personal information deleted.

**Authorized Agent.** The CCPA enables California users to appoint an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit disclosure requests and or deletion requests under the CCPA. The authorized agent must register with the California Secretary of State. We will honor a request from an authorized agent provided you provide written authorization to the authorized agent to act on your behalf and we can verify your identity and the agent submits proof of authorization.

**CCPA Metrics.** We are required to compile certain annual metrics regarding the CPPA including the number of disclosures, deletion and opt-out requests we receive, the median number of days it takes us to respond and how many of each were denied. We will provide this information starting in 2021 by posting a link in this Policy.
