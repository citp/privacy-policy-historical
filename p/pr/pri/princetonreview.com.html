<p class="regTwelveBlack">The Princeton Review takes your privacy seriously. This 
  Privacy Policy applies to all of our customers, whether you buy our services 
  or products online or offline. It also applies to visitors to our free websites.<br>
  The Princeton Review takes strong measures to protect your privacy. First, we 
  only ask you to provide information that we need in order to deliver the service 
  you have requested. Second, we don't share the information you have given us 
  without your permission to do so. </p>
<p class="boldTwelveBlue">OVERALL<a name="overall"></a></p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Services that Require 
  Personal Information</span><a name="personalinfo"></a><br>
  We will request personally identifiable information from you when you purchase 
  some of our products, including online and offline courses, and when using some 
  of our Web-based services. We will request information that we need in order 
  for you to participate in the service (things like your name and address, for 
  example) or pay for the service (credit card information, for example). </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">The Princeton Review offers several opportunities to 
  receive products or information on- and off-line, either directly from us or 
  from our partners. You indicate your wish to receive this information by checking 
  a box on a form; unless you ask for it, nothing will be sent to you and nothing 
  will be shared with third parties.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">To fulfill these requests we often need more information 
  from you than when you only purchase a product or service from us. Records of 
  these transactions will be kept for customer service purposes only. The additional 
  information we ask for will vary depending on what it is you're requesting, 
  but generally includes your mailing address, year of graduation, and, in the 
  case of requests passed on to colleges, information that you choose to provide 
  regarding your academic and extracurricular activities and interests. This information, 
  which does NOT include personally identifiable information, is then passed on 
  to the third party to fulfill your request; they may have their own privacy 
  policies that differ from ours. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">We will not share your personally identifiable information 
  with any third party, unless we need to in order to provide you the service 
  you have purchased or you give us permission to share. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">We may track data on our customers in aggregate form. 
  Such aggregated data does not uniquely identify you. We may share this aggregated 
  data with others.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="boldTwelveBlack">Schools</span><a name="schools"></a><br>
  We work with schools and institutions to provide programs such as test preparation 
  and college counseling. Your school, district, or state may arrange for you 
  to participate in these programs and may purchase products on your behalf. We 
  may share personally identifiable information that you provide to us through 
  your participation in these school programs with your school, district, state 
  department of education, and your parents. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">COPPA Compliance</span><a name="coppa"></a><br>
  The Princeton Review is in complete accordance with the Children's Online Privacy 
  Protection Act of 1998. Except for K-12 students who participate in our Homeroom 
  or ECOS product, we do not accept personally identifiable information online 
  from children under the age of 13. (For more information on Homeroom or ECOS, 
  please see below.) If we become aware that our records contain such information, 
  we will delete it.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Marketing Lists</span><a name="lists"></a><br>
From time to time, we obtain lists of people who may be interested in our products and services from third-party marketing list suppliers. We use these lists to send direct marketing promotions by mail or by email. We do our best to only obtain these lists from suppliers who have opt-in policies for third-party marketing, but we are not responsible for the conduct and policies of these suppliers. Please note that even if you are a registered customer of ours and have asked us not to use the information you provided to us to send you promotional material, a third-party marketing list supplier could still provide us with your name and address, in which case you will receive the promotional material sent by us to others on the supplier's list. If you have received a promotion from us and do not wish to receive future promotions, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@review.com">privacy@review.com</a>.

<p class="boldTwelveBlue">LIVE COURSES<a name="livecourses"></a></p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Subscriptions </span><br>
  Many of our course students are given supplemental materials to help them prepare 
  for their test. For example, if you become a student of The Princeton Review, 
  we may provide you with magazine and/or newspaper subscriptions,* at no additional 
  charge, as an additional benefit. If you would rather not receive supplemental 
  materials, you will need to contact us and ask us to remove your name from our 
  supplemental materials lists. Offline course students should contact your local 
  office. Online students should email support.online@mail.review.com or call 
  888.755.7737.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">* For classes sold directly to students or their parents:<br>

<p class="boldTwelveBlue">ON THE INTERNET<a name="online"></a></p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Anonymous Areas</span><a name="onlineoverall"></a><br>
  Some areas of our websites are accessible without registration of any kind. 
  This is true of many of the basic content areas. Other areas require registration.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Services that Require 
  Registration</span><br>
  Some of our most useful services are personalized: different visitors get different 
  results based on information they provide. Examples include but are not limited 
  to Homeroom, Advanced School Search, Online Tests, Online Course Demos, School 
  Match, the Tuition Cost Calculator, and any surveys or contests in which you 
  may choose to participate. Registration for these services is required to facilitate 
  customization of your individual results.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">In addition to providing personalized results, registration 
  is important for sending you specific information related to your service, and 
  for allowing you to access stored information, and in the event that you opt-in, 
  provide third party access to you. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">How are cookies used? 
  </span><br>
  We also use a software technology called "cookies" to create a personalized 
  Web experience. <br>
  Cookies cannot be used to find your name, e-mail address, or anything that is 
  uniquely identifying about you unless you provide that information. We use cookies 
  for those applications to which we referred earlier that require us to keep 
  track of information to customize results. If you don't have your browser set 
  to accept cookies, certain areas of PrincetonReview.com, ECOS, and Homeroom.com 
  will not function. We also allow you to choose to use a cookie to save your 
  username and password so that you do not have to log in to the website each 
  time you visit. We do not recommend this in multi-user environments such as 
  school computer labs.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Partner Privacy Policies</span><br>
  When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party websites, 
  you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support 
  the protection of privacy on the Internet, The Princeton Review cannot be responsible 
  for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy 
  statement whenever interacting with any website you visit. Homeroom.com and 
  ECOS do not display third party banner ads on the site, although there may be 
  resource links to third party content.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Passive Collection of 
  Data</span><br>
  Like most sites, we maintain logs of site usage in order to evaluate our visitors' 
  interest level in areas of the website, which and how many pages they look at, 
  how long they stay on the site, and what Web browsers are used. This data is 
  tracked in aggregate form, not at an individual user level, and is not uniquely 
  identifying. The aggregate level data may be shared with 3rd parties and the 
  public. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Cautions</span><br>
  Please note, if you do not logout once registered for services that require 
  registration, your personal information could be viewed by other users with 
  access to your computer.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Please note, if you choose to participate in our online 
  discussion forums, your posts will be publicly accessible, as will the username 
  and e-mail address you use.</p>
<p class="boldTwelveBlue">Specific Privacy Issues for PrincetonReview.com<a name="princetonreview"></a></p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Registration: </span><br>
  When registering on PrincetonReview.com you will need to provide an email address 
  and password. You need to choose a secret password to keep the personal information 
  you entered on PrincetonReview.com private. In addition, we request your mailing 
  address for certain services so that we can send you the information you request 
  via mail, or in the event you opt-in, provide third party access to you.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">If a user elects to use our system to inform a friend 
  or parent/guardian about our site, particularly the Word Du Jour feature or 
  Lender’s Center, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. 
  The Princeton Review will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting 
  them to visit the site. The Princeton Review stores this information for the 
  sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact The Princeton 
  Review at webmaster@review.com to request the removal of this information from 
  our database.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Changing Personal Information</span><br>
  You may unsubscribe to Word du Jour simply by going to the WDJ subscription 
  page and updating your subscription (if you are not logged in, you will be prompted 
  to log in first). </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">If you want to change any of the personal information 
  that you completed when you registered or opt-out of any of the opt-ins that 
  you selected, sign-in to your personal My Review and click “Account Profile”. 
</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Online Requests for Products, Services, and Information 
  We provide information in aggregate about users to schools and lenders:</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">· Number of users who have visited the school’s 
  or lender’s page on our website<br>
  · Number of users who have clicked on an external link to the school’s 
  or lender’s website<br>
  · Number of users who have sent an instant inquiry from the school’s 
  or lender’s profile page<br>
  · Number of users who have listed the school in their favorite schools 
  area.<br>
  · Number of users who have opened the school’s or lender’s 
  application<br>
  · Number of users who have submitted the school’s or lender’s 
  application</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Internally, we track users who have taken the above 
  actions on the PrincetonReview.com website. If you have opted in to be contacted 
  by a 3rd party, then the actions above could be used by us to direct targeted 
  e-mail to you. Our colleges, universities and lenders use a Princeton Review 
  internal e-mailing system to send information that may be of interest to you, 
  only if you have opted in. These 3rd parties do not receive personally identifiable 
  information, like your name or email address. However, if you respond to an 
  e-mail from a college, university or lender, then your response will provide 
  them with personal information about you. To opt-out of any online service on 
  PrincetonReview.com, simply sign-in to your personal My Review and click “Account 
  Profile” and opt-out of any service you wish.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web 
  Bugs)</span><br>
  Doubleclick, the company that serves our banner advertisements for PrincetonReview.com, 
  uses a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), 
  that helps inform them about what content is active. Clear gifs are tiny graphics 
  with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track 
  the online movements of Web user. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and very 
  small, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies 
  on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. 
  That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", 
  which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the website would read the clear 
  gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the 
  past online behavior for that computer. The information would then go back to 
  the advertising company. To learn more about Doubleclick's use of clear gifs, 
  please go to: www.doubleclick.com.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails, 
  to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows 
  us to know how well customers respond to certain communications and the effectiveness 
  of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, simply 
  sign-in to your personal My Review and click “Account Profile” and 
  opt-out of any service you wish.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><br>
  <span class="boldTwelveBlue">Specific Privacy Issues for Homeroom.com:<a name="homeroom"></a></span></p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">We know that privacy is very important to you, especially 
  where your children are concerned and we want you to know that we put children's 
  privacy first. We make you three promises: </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">· Homeroom is in complete compliance with the 
  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) <br>
  · Parents will always have access to all the personal information we 
  have about their children, including their work at the site. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">· We will never share with third parties personal 
  information that identifies any of the students, without parental authorization. 
</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Complete Compliance with 
  COPPA: </span><br>
  Homeroom is in complete accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
  Act of 1998. For Homeroom, we work with all of our clients to ensure that COPPA 
  rules are being followed in conjunction with the creation of student accounts. 
  A printable consent form is built into Homeroom to help teachers secure parental 
  consent when applicable. Parents will always have access to all personal information 
  we have about their children, including all their child's work at the site</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><span class="boldTwelveBlack">Parent Access to Homeroom</span><br>
  Homeroom is designed to be a student-appropriate and kid-friendly site. Our 
  site is highly interactive and designed to provide a different experience for 
  every user. In order to make this possible, we collect the information and provide 
  the services listed below. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Students register by giving us their full name and gender, 
  and they have the option of giving us their e-mail address. They then pick a 
  password. This information is then combined with the identifying information 
  we have received from their school and the student's teacher, grade, and subject 
  matter. This information is only available to us, the student, the student's 
  school, and the parent. We use this information to provide a personalized interactive 
  environment for each student and to give the teachers and school, district or 
  state administrators the information necessary to track each student's progress 
  and make effective use of Homeroom.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Each student has a unique user name, which is the student's 
  screen name and the Students are publicly identified at the site only by their 
  user name. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">As a service to its users, Homeroom provides Homeroom 
  e-mail services within our closed environment. Each of our users-students, parents, 
  administrators, and teachers is given ability in their Homeroom account to communicate 
  with another Homeroom user As with all e-mail accounts, children may disclose 
  personal information about themselves to their Homeroom e-mail correspondents. 
  All users should practice safe computing, and parents should advise their children 
  not to give out any personal information without parental consent. Schools and 
  districts have the ability to disable the Homeroom email system.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Parents have their own Homeroom user accounts. Registration 
  is similar to that for students, with parents providing their names, address, 
  gender, and e-mail. Through these accounts they can view and update information 
  about their children, and send and receive e-mail. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">Parents are welcome to review their children's personal 
  information. They can also change or delete their children's optional personal 
  information. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">NOTE: Homeroom.com reserves the right to terminate service 
  for a student if a parent wishes to delete information that is necessary to 
  our operations, such as First Name, Last Name, Grade, and Gender.</p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">We do not condition a child's participation in an activity 
  on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary 
  to participate in that activity. </p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack"><br>
  <span class="boldTwelveBlue">Sharing of Information: </span></p>
<p class="regTwelveBlack">The privacy of individual user data for school administrators, 
  teachers, parents, and students is always respected and protected. We will never 
  disclose, sell, or rent personal information that identifies any of our Homeroom 
  users without specific authorization to do so. Only the student, the teacher, 
  the school administration, and the parent(s) have access to this information. 
  Each school has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of this information. 
  The Princeton Review retains the right to release aggregate performance information 
  provided this information is not personally identifiable by district, school 
  or individual students and teachers.<br>
