This Privacy Policy is part of our [Terms of Use] if you are using Primate Labs’ site or part of the applicable end user license agreement if you are using a Primate Labs’ mobile application. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies not owned or controlled by Primate Labs or to people whom Primate Labs does not employ or manage.  This policy also does not address non-personally identifiable information (i.e., mobile device properties, device software platform and firmware, mobile phone carrier) which we may use and disclose to provide and further develop our products and services. The policy specifically addresses the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information is collected by Primate Labs or by any third party through our site and/or via our products or services;</li>
<li>How Primate Labs uses this information;</li>
<li>With whom Primate Labs may share this information;</li>
<li>What choices are available to you as a user of the site and/or products and services with respect to collection, use and distribution of the information;</li>
<li>What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control; and</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>

<p>Primate Labs is the sole owner of the information collected on this site or via our products and services. Primate Labs may collect information from you at the following three different stages.</p>

<p>First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to the site and users of our products and services. Second, Primate Labs collects personally identifiable information when you create Primate Labs’ account and when you order Primate Labs’ products or utilize certain services. Online account creation may require you to submit the following personal information: name, address, company information, email address, and phone number. For purposes of billing, you may need to provide your credit card type, number, expiration date and billing address for the card. Certain personally identifiable information is required if you subscribe to Primate Labs’ newsletter, or sign up to participate in a promotion, sweepstake or survey through the site. Primate Labs may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners.</p>

<h4>Personal Information of Children Under 13</h4>

<p>Primate Labs complies with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). This site and Primate Labs’ products and services are not directed to children and Primate Labs does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information form children under 13 years of age.</p>

<h4>Use of Your Personal Information</h4>

<p>Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using our site and to allow us to provide products and services to you.  Primate Labs will never give your information to, or share your information with, any third party not affiliated with or owned by Primate Labs, except as permitted by law.

</ul>


<h5>Profile</h5>

<p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our customers. A profile is stored information detailing how individual customers use the site.
