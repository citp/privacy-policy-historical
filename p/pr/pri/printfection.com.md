Use of Personal Data

Personal Data is mainly used for Printfection’s own internal purposes in order to provide the Printfection Services to you including but not limited to producing and shipping items, processing orders, customer service issues, maintaining and improving the Web Sites, and providing Printfection marketing materials.

Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Printfection Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

Printfection uses this information internally to assist in determining changes and/or upgrades to the Web Site, whether to add or discontinue specific products or services, and for internal market analysis purposes. Printfection may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services or products we believe will be of interest to you or other Printfection Services-related announcements. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Printfection reserves the right to send you notifications regarding your account even if you opt-out of all voluntary email notifications (such notifications may include order status, account status, or other non-marketing notifications not covered by the opt-out).

We will also provide an EU or Swiss individual with opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their data with third parties other than our agents (our agents include our third-party printing, fulfillment, and/or shipping companies), or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
