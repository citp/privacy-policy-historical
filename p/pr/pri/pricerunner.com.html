</p><p align="justify">At Pricerunner.com ("we", "us", "Site") we respect your privacy and want to ensure that each and every member feels comfortable in sharing their personal data. We make every effort to keep your information confidential and protect your privacy when using our site and services. We take your privacy and our responsibility under the privacy laws very seriously. 
</p><p align="justify"><u>Please read this privacy policy carefully since by visiting the Site and sharing information with us you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy unless you offer different terms which are accepted by us in writing. </u>
</p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><b> CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</b></font>

</p><p align="justify">Effective January 1, 2005, companies that collect personally identifiable information ("PII")  from California residents and disclose such information to third parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with third parties.  We have elected the second option and you may request that your PII not be shared with third parties by sending your request, including your full name, email address and postal address to Pricerunner, Attn: SB 27 Officer, P.O. Box 5600, Westlake Village, CA 91361.  
</p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><b> I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></font>
</p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><b> A. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</b>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner does not automatically collect any personal information about you.  We do collect PII such as your name, e-mail address, geographical location, age and gender through membership registration, newsletter sign-up requests or promotional contests.   Please note that it is not necessary for you to become a member in order to use many of the features on Pricerunner.com, a non-member can easily see products and prices, perform searches, read reviews and take advantage of many other useful features on the site.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner also operates a free e-newsletter service - <b>the Pricerunner Update</b> - to help you keep up-to-date with the best deals, contests and Pricerunner news. This is an opt-in service so, as a member, you will receive the newsletter. To unsubscribe simply send an e-mail to <a class="text" href="mailto:info-us@pricerunner.com">info-us@pricerunner.com</a> and include your e-mail address. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">The reason that we ask for this PII is to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with any promotions you participate in.  
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">We also use this information for internal business purposes, such as aggregating the data to help us to create a profile of Pricerunner visitors - as a whole - so that we can; a) build a better understanding of our users and enhance the services we offer, and b) attract advertisers to spend money on Pricerunner, thus enabling our free price comparison service to operate.   
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Unless you tell us not to, we may use your personal information to contact you about offers or promotions from Pricerunner and selected third parties we think you would be interested in. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b> B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII). </b></font>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner uses cookies - a small text file containing a unique string of numbers or letters that is placed on a computer - to ‘remember’ your computer when you visit the site. Using cookies helps us serve ads, take polls and better manage the services we offer. This will not collect any personally identifiable information about you. Cookies do not recognize you as a person, just your computer. They cannot be used to obtain other information from your hard drive. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on the pages that visitors access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes.

</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b> II. INFORMATION SHARING </b></font>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner may use third party vendors to help us operate our business and this Site or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by Pricerunner.
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge PII with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner may share PII (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with co-branded partners, advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any Pricerunner division.  
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Please note that while Pricerunner encourages merchants and marketing partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, we are not responsible for the information practices of our merchants or marketing partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by such third parties is subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this policy.  Please be sure to review their policy prior to providing any information. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner may release account and any other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Pricerunner or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b> III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS </b></font>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">If at anytime you no longer wish to receive offers from a Pricerunner, you may "unsubscribe" by sending an email to <a class="text" href="mailto:info-us@pricerunner.com">info-us@pricerunner.com</a> or by using the unsubscribe option within any promotional offer.  In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, you will be removed entirely from our email list and will no longer receive offers from us. If you have registered or submitted PII under more than one email account, you must submit separate unsubscribe requests from each account. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">The Cookies we use do not have an "opt-out" option, yet you still have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in your Internet browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner sends a confirming email for each member registration.  You may change, correct or update your information by email by contacting <a class="text" href="mailto:info-us@pricerunner.com">info-us@pricerunner.com</a>.  Changing or deleting your information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from the Pricerunner will change or delete the data only in our database for purposes of transacting future business on our sites and for managing future communications from Pricerunner.  These changes and deletions will not change or delete information already collected as part of a particular transaction. 
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b> IV. SECURITY </b></font>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on Pricerunner’s servers are treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. Access is password-protected and limited to individuals at whose job responsibilities require the access 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Pricerunner to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII, Pricerunner cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with us.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b> V. CONSENT AND CHANGES </b></font>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by Pricerunner prior to the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out of such proposed change.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><b> VI. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND SPAM </b></font>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Pricerunner' web sites, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. If you believe your child has provided Pricerunner with any personally identifiable data by registering at a Pricerunner web site, please contact <a class="text" href="mailto:info-us@pricerunner.com">info-us@pricerunner.com</a> to have them removed. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Pricerunner is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701). It is our policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or "Spam" email by Pricerunner or any of its marketing partners. 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="arial" size="2">Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. The table below clarifies which opt-out mechanism you should use.
