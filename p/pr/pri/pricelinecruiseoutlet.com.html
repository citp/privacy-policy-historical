<h2><a name="Sharing">Sharing Your Personal Data</a></h2>
<p>Priceline.com does not share your Personal Data, except as disclosed in this statement. Priceline.com may share your Personal Data with its subsidiaries and with third parties as described in the categories below:</p>
<p><u>Certain Services:</u>  In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with our third party partners, or require that you transact directly with a third party partner. Third party partners consist of companies with which priceline.com has contracted in order to provide you with services or products featured on our Site.  Below is a list of some of such services:</p>
<p><i>Priceline Cruises.</i> Priceline Cruises are offered through National Leisure Group, LLC ("NLG"). When you provide Personal Data in connection with the purchase or booking of a cruise, you are providing such Personal Data to NLG, which holds such Personal Data on our behalf. Our contract with NLG requires NLG to maintain such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><i>Priceline Group Hotels.</i>  Priceline Group Hotels are offered through Lexyl Travel Technologies, Inc. ("Lexyl"). When you provide Personal Data in connection with the Group Hotels service, you are providing such Personal Data to Lexyl, which holds such Personal Data on our behalf. Our contract with Lexyl requires Lexyl to maintain such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><i>Great Fun® Online Savings Club.</i> After or during the booking process on Priceline.com, our partner, Trilegiant Corporation ("Trilegiant"), will offer you an opportunity to join their Great Fun® Online Savings Club.  When you join the club, you are authorizing us to provide your Personal Data to Trilegiant, which treats your Personal Data in accordance with the Trilegiant privacy policy and not this priceline.com Privacy Policy.  For information on how your privacy is protected when using the Great Fun® Online Savings Club service, <a title="Great Fun Online Savings Club privacy policy" href="http://www.greatfunonline.com/Content.aspx?SID=73CAD40B433449E60d23a50eb87d21d9&amp;content=customerCenter%2fprivacy">click here.</a></p>
<p><i>Pricelinemortgage.</i> Priceline.com's partner, EverBank, offers financial services through Priceline Mortgage Company LLC, d/b/a pricelinemortgage.  Like priceline.com, pricelinemortgage utilizes the priceline.com Name Your Own Price® demand collection system to offer financial services including mortgages, home equity loans, and banking and other services.  
When you engage in these services, you are providing your Personal Data to pricelinemortgage, which treats your Personal Data in accordance with the pricelinemortgage Privacy Policy, and not this priceline.com Privacy Policy.  Due to the nature of the financial services that are provided on pricelinemortgage, the pricelinemortgage Privacy Policy may have different 
policies with respect to sharing your information.  For example, the nature of pricelinemortgage's home financing services requires that pricelinemortgage share the information you provide in your finance request with up to four participating providers. To review the pricelinemortgage Privacy Policy, <a title="pricelinemortgage privacy policy" href="finance_privacy.asp?session_key=5D0011AC3F0011AC2007102706433100c7c1053017&amp;plf=pcln">click here</a></p>
<p>We may revise this list from time to time if we decide to offer additional services through these or other third-party partners.</p>
<p><u>Priceline.com's Agents:</u> Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, priceline.com hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail) analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Priceline.com requires all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p><u>External Service Providers:</u>  When you use the priceline.com service to purchase an airline ticket, reserve a hotel room or a rental car or to take advantage of any of our other products and services (including travel insurance), we provide Personal Data to the airline, hotel, car rental agency, travel agency or other involved third-party. </p>
<p><u>Advertisements, Marketing Material and Other Offers:</u>  Unless you tell us that you do not want to receive these offers, priceline.com will occasionally send advertisements, marketing material or other offers on behalf of other businesses that we think might be of interest to you. This material is sent by priceline.com, and when we send these offers, we do not give that other business your name or address. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, please <a title="unsubscribe" href="/customerservice/faq/unsubscribe.asp?session_key=5D0011AC3F0011AC2007102706433100c7c1053017&amp;plf=pcln">click here</a> to unsubscribe.</p>
<p><u>Future Business Transfers: </u> Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, priceline.com may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that priceline.com, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction.</p>
<p><u>Compliance with Law and Protection of Priceline.com:</u>  Priceline.com reserves the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with the law. We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, or protect the rights, property or safety of priceline.com, our users, or others.</p>
