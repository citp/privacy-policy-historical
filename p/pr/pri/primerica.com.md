**Primerica Privacy Notice**

**Your Privacy Is Important To Us.**

**Your Trust Is Our Priority**  


Consumer privacy is making headlines lately. With all the communication channels available today, protecting the personal information of customers has assumed a new level of concern. This pamphlet is provided to every prospective Primerica customer in an effort to assure our customers understand our information practices and their rights to direct us in the sharing of certain information.  


At Primerica, we’ve made privacy a priority since we began doing business. In fact, in addition to legal requirements, we’ve long observed our own high standards of protecting your privacy, long before this issue was newsworthy. We know our business depends on your trust and confidence, and we’ll never jeopardize that.

**Your Privacy at Primerica**

Keeping customer information secure and using it only as permitted by law and our own high standards is a top priority for all of us at Primerica, a member of the Citigroup family of companies. We care about the privacy of our customers who obtain products or services from us for personal, family or household purposes (“you”). We are providing you this Notice to help you understand the information we collect, and what information we may disclose about you. This Notice also tells you what to do if you do not want us to disclose certain personal information about you.  


While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our customers’ trust. We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. We will tell current customers in plain language, initially and at least once annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At any time, customers can contact us to remove their names from such lists. We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their information (except when we’re prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors, which we will promptly correct.

We apply the same policies to former customers that apply to current customers. We may amend our privacy notice from time to time. As required by law, we will send our current customers our privacy notice at least annually. We will comply with your privacy choice in accordance with federal law and the privacy laws and regulations of your state.

Primerica operates through a group of companies that are managed from our headquarters in Duluth, Georgia. These companies include Primerica Financial Services, Inc., Primerica Life Insurance Company, PFS Investments Inc., Primerica Financial Services Home Mortgages, Inc. and Primerica Client Services, Inc.

Primerica markets these products through its independent Representatives who typically market only those financial products authorized by Primerica. The Representatives are sending you their privacy notice in this same pamphlet, which you should read in conjunction with this Notice.

Primerica protects personal information it collects about you by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed requirements of applicable law. Any affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom Primerica provides your personal information must agree to follow appropriate standards of security and confidentiality. Primerica instructs its employees how to properly handle personal information. 

II. Categories of Personal Information We Collect and May Disclose

IV. Categories of Nonaffiliated Third Parties To Whom We May Disclose Personal Information  
Nonaffiliated third parties are those not part of the family of companies controlled by Citigroup Inc. Representatives are nonaffiliated third parties of Primerica.  


We may disclose personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties with your consent or at your direction. We may also disclose certain information about you without your consent to nonaffiliated third parties, as permitted by law, for purposes such as servicing or maintaining your product, processing a transaction that you request, allowing nonaffiliated third parties to perform services or marketing on our behalf, and complying with legal requirements.  


The categories of nonaffiliated third parties we disclose information to are the following:  


  * Financial services providers, such as companies engaged in banking, consumer finance, securities and insurance; and  

  * Non-financial companies, such as companies engaged in direct marketing, retailing and the selling of customer products and services.  




Additionally, we may disclose all of the information we collect about you, as described above, to nonaffiliated third parties that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing or service agreements. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law.

V. Your Ability to Opt Out of Certain Information Disclosure   
You may request that we not disclose certain personal information about you, that is, to “opt out” of disclosure:

> A. Sharing Among the Primerica Companies and with Primerica Affiliates  
>  While the law allows us to share personal information regarding your transactions and our experiences with you among ourselves, as well as with our affiliates, we will not share any other information, except to the extent sharing is permitted by law, if you have opted out as provided in this Notice.

Your request will remain in effect until you notify us otherwise in writing. If you have opted out previously, you need not do so again.  


If you are also a customer of other Citigroup affiliates (such as Citibank, CitiMortgage, Travelers Bank & Trust, fsb, Travelers Insurance, Salomon Smith Barney) and you receive a notice of their intent to disclose certain information about you, you will need to separately notify them if you do not want that information disclosed.

If the information should be corrected, Primerica will update its files, and send the correction to anyone who received the incorrect information. If Primerica does not agree that the information is incorrect, you have the right to give Primerica a statement of what you believe to be the correct information, which Primerica will place in your file and send to anyone who received or will receive the original information. 

However, we will not send you any medical information we have received about you from a doctor or other health care provider. Instead, you should contact the doctor or health care provider directly to obtain the information you seek. In addition, information collected in connection with, or in reasonable anticipation of, a claim or civil or criminal proceeding is not subject to the rights described above. 

If you have any questions about the right of access to, or the correction of, the information in your file, please write Primerica Life at our Executive Offices located at 3120 Breckinridge Boulevard, Duluth, GA 30099-0001.
