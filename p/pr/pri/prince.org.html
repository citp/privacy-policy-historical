<h2>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h2>

This Privacy Policy covers prince.org's treatment of personally
identifiable information that prince.org collects 
when you are on the prince.org site, and when you use

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that
prince.org does not own or control, or to people that prince.org does
not employ or manage.

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

prince.org will not sell or rent your personally identifiable
information to anyone.  prince.org may send personally identifiable
information about you to other companies or people in response to 
subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or we find that your actions 
on our web sites violate the prince.org <a href="http://www.prince.org/user_agreement.html">User Agreement</a>.

<h2>Cookies</h2>

The <b>exclusive</b> purpose of these cookies is to maintain 'state',

contents are NOT available to other parties or websites.

<h2>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h2>

Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether 
you want prince.org to contact you about specials and new products.

verifying your password once more and
confirming your choice to terminate the account. 

<h2>Security</h2>
Your prince.org Account Information is password-protected for your 
privacy and security. In certain areas prince.org may utilize
industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
