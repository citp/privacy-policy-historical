<h2>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h2>

This Privacy Policy covers prince.org's treatment of personally
identifiable information that prince.org collects 
when you are on the prince.org site, and when you use
prince.org's services. 
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that
prince.org does not own or control, or to people that prince.org does
not employ or manage.

register for a prince.org account, when you use certain prince.org

receives and records information on our server logs from your browser
including your IP address, prince.org cookie information and the page

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

prince.org will not sell or rent your personally identifiable
information to anyone.  prince.org may send personally identifiable
information about you to other companies or people in response to 
subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or we find that your actions 
on our web sites violate the prince.org <a href="http://prince.org/user_agreement.html">User Agreement</a>.

<h2>Cookies</h2>

prince.org may set and access prince.org cookies on your computer.
The <b>exclusive</b> purpose of these cookies is to maintain 'state',
such as whether or not you are logged in to your account. No

name, is stored in these cookies. prince.org's cookies and their
contents are NOT available to other parties or websites.

<h2>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h2>

prince.org gives you the ability to edit your prince.org 
Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether 
you want prince.org to contact you about specials and new products.

verifying your password once more and
confirming your choice to terminate the account. 

<h2>Security</h2>
Your prince.org Account Information is password-protected for your 
privacy and security. In certain areas prince.org may utilize
industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

prince.org may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any
substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we 
will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages, and
at our discretion, optionally e-mailing all users.
