This Policy is limited solely to online transactions and do not apply to any off line privacy rights or obligations, data collection and data transfers. 

### Collection of Information.

We collect personal data from our users during the initial registration process, notification process and when users contact us for any reason. Thus, users can determine to some extent what information they wish to provide to us. In addition to the initial registration process, we may, from time to time, ask users to answer surveys about our or third party products and services. We gather this data in order to better understand our users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.

Through the use of "cookies" and "pixel tags"(both described below) and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data including name, address, email address, phone or mobile number. We may also collect demographic information such as age, gender, income level or technical information such as IP address, domain name, email address, site traffic, where you visited before or after visiting our website.

### Collection of Technology Information.

As stated above, we collect technology information through cookies and pixel tags. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory.

Cookies can collect the information we noted above. Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on our website. For example, we use cookies to track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services that we think may interest you, and estimate the audience size. We also use cookies to store user names and information that are supplied at registration. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software to delete or block the cookie.

Third party advertisers and publishers may place cookies on your computer by or through our Website. We have no access or control of third party cookies. However, you may block or remove them in the same manner as our cookies through your browser settings.

"Pixel tracking" is a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on the Website. Pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the Website and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixels are tracking measures to determine the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of the Websites you may visit and is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow us to track that this advertisement brought you to us. If you visit our website and we link you to another website we are able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted business with a third party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report website activity to us.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click data. We use this information, which does not identify you directly to analyze trends, administer the website, track your movements around our website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
