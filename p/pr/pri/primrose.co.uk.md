# Primrose Privacy Policy

In order to process your order we need to ask for your name, address and contact details. We keep these details on file so that we know who our customers are and we can deal with any service queries or returns. 

When you place your order you are given the choice about whether or not you would like us to contact you with email newsletters detailing product launches and special offers, and whether or not you would like to join our catalogue mailing list. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

We use cookies on Primrose.co.uk to maximise your shopping experience by providing you with personalised features (like products you may be interested in based on what you've viewed previously). Your browser will need to accept cookies, as we can only provide you with these features by using them.
