## Visitor Data Collected on this Web Site

Spotlight tags are currently used on our website to automatically collect certain navigational information about visitors to our site. These spotlight tags do not collect personally identifiable information about our website visitors. Spotlight tags only analyze behavior of users who have previously clicked or viewed one of our online advertisements. This information is collected to provide the best user experience within our Web site. This information is stored in a "cookie" specific to this Web site (see "[Cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/cookies.htm)"). We use the information to improve the content of our Web pages. 

A spotlight tag is an HTML tag that is used by a Third party ad server to track the activities of users that visit a given Web page. These activities include information that is not personally identifiable, such as pages visited. At no time do spotlight tags record user name, password, e-mail, IP home addresses, etc. Spotlight activities are reported only if they are created by a user who meets the following three criteria:

  * Either clicks one of our ads and is sent to our Web site, or views one of ours ads and accesses our Web site later
  * Performs an activity on a Web page containing a spotlight tag
  * Performs this activity within 30 days of clicking and/or viewing one of our ads
