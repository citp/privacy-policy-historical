# Privacy Policies | The Principal Financial Group

_Last updated: October, 2015_

Your personal information is important to you.  It’s important to us, too.  That’s why we do so much to protect your information, while continually providing service you can count on.  While no one can guarantee absolute information security, we protect your information in many ways – from working to ensure that our buildings are secure, to proactively preparing for disasters and business interruptions, to using safe and secure computing practices.  We continually review and make enhancements to how we safeguard and protect customer information.

We apply industry best security practices and have procedures in place to protect data entrusted to us. These procedures and related standards include limiting access to data and regularly testing and auditing our security practices and technologies.

Employees and temporary workers are required to follow policies and procedures plus complete confidentiality training to understand the requirement of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. If they fail to do so, they are subject to disciplinary action.

All employees are required to complete privacy, security, ethics and compliance training. We also offer a wide variety of other training to all employees and temporary workers to help us achieve our goal of protecting your information.

We strive to keep our records accurate and will make appropriate corrections when you notify us. Please let us know if there is incorrect information in any statements or other communications that you receive from us.

If you would like to correct or update your personally identifiable information, please contact us by sending a letter via postal mail or through our [online contact us](https://www.principal.com/contact-us) reply form.
