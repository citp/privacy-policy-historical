<h2>
7. Our use of cookies and other technologies.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>
Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer. It's stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.&nbsp;<br>
Currently, our Site does not recognize browser do-not-track requests. &nbsp;However, users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Please be aware that blocking cookies may affect the functionality of our Site.</p>
<p>
You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the table below:</p>
<p><img height="808" alt="Cookies" width="636" src="/~/media/images/cookies.ashx?la=en-us"></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.45em;">Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong><span style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.45em;"> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about Site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</span></p>
<p><strong>
Third-party Analytics.</strong> We use third party analytics tools, including Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
8. What about user images and other content?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
We invite you to post content (e.g., images and comments) to the Site. If you post content, your content may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Statement, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>
<p>
Remember, once you upload your image to the Site it will be up there for everyone to see, so make sure you are comfortable with that BEFORE you upload it. Your image may also be selected by our buyers if they like your style and they may choose to use it on their own page of our Site. If they do so, other users will be able to comment on your image, and their comments may be good or bad so make sure that you are ok with that before you decide to upload your image to the Site.</p>
<p>
If you change your mind and you decide you no longer want your image to be on our Site, you can remove your image from the Primania section of the Site. Simply go into your profile, select the image you want to remove and click the 'Remove look' button below the image. Please note that on certain browsers, due to cache memory, it could take approximately 1 hour for the look to be removed from our Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you would like us to remove your image and any associated comments from the Features section of our Site, please send us your request using our <a href="/en-us/customer-service/contact-us">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
<p>
Even if you remove an image or content from our Site, we may retain a copy of such content in our systems. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>
9. What about Third Party Links?</h2>
<p>
Our Site and Services may contain links to third party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Statement, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>
<p><strong>
Children Under 13.</strong> Our Site and Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to promptly and securely delete such information from our systems.</p>
<h2>
10. Accessing your personal information and contacting us</h2>
<p>
You may review and update your profile information, and remove certain content you have posted, by logging in to you profile and making the desired changes.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Us.</strong> You can contact us for any other reason using our <a href="/en-us/customer-service/contact-us">Contact Us</a> page.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>
Changes to this Privacy Statement.</strong> We may amend and update this Privacy Statement from time to time and new versions will be posted to our Site.
