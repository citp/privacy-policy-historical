    <p>(Updated 24th July, 2012)</p>
	<p>1ShoppingCart<sup>®</sup> respects the privacy of its customers and the visitors and users of its websites.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information we obtain about you based upon your use of our website, products or services. "Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable to you such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, any transactions you conduct on our websites or offline with us, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.</p>

	<p>We pay close attention to how Personal Information is used and shared, and we use Personal Information sensibly.</p>

	<p>We act as a service provider to our customers and may process and store on behalf of our customers Personal Information that our customers collect about third parties. We do not own that Personal Information.</p>

	<h4>User Consent</h4>
	
    <p>By visiting our websites, using our products or services or otherwise submitting Personal Information through our websites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. Personal Information may be processed by Web.com or Web.com's trusted vendors or other third parties in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent.</p>

	<h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
	<p>The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn about our customers and potential customers. We use this information to better tailor the features, performance and support of our solutions, products and services, and to contact you from time to time about with information and offers about our products and services.</p>

	<h4>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h4>
	<p>We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. The Personal Information we collect includes, but is not limited to, the following: name, mailing address, Web address, telephone number, e-mail address, and information contained in any e-mail or other communication you send to us or information you give to us in any other way. </p>

	<h4>Personal Information Collected via Technology</h4>
	<p>As you navigate our website, certain passive information may also be collected, including your Internet Protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use cookies, a small file stored by your web browser on your computer, and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to make our solutions and services more useful to you by understanding what pages you click on during your visit to our websites.

In addition, we may share your Personal Information with other businesses that may contact you regarding requests for service. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails as well as information and offers about our products and services.</p>
    <p>We may use third-party advertising partners and its service providers in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. They will collect anonymous information about your visits to our site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Websites to target advertisements for goods and services and may be used to keep track of user response to each advertisement. These targeted advertisements may appear on our site or on other sites that you visit.

	<h4>Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>
	<p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not generally sell your Personal Information to third parties. In order to build the solutions for you, we may engage third parties to assist us, and, in connection with such assistance, we may provide them with Personal Information that you have provided and that is necessary for them to assist us. We may also share your Personal Information with trusted vendors or other third parties in order for them to provide you with offers that we think you will find valuable.</p>

	<p>We currently have subsidiaries and other companies under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"). We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on 1ShoppingCart; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of 1ShoppingCart or users of our websites or our customers' websites.</p>
