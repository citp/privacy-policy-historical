Not providing Personal Data may prevent us from providing you with requested information and carrying out transactions. However, you can always exercise control over our use of Personal Data for direct marketing (click here for details) and you can control the use of cookies on our site (click here for details). 

We also use your Personal Data as described in the "Sharing Your Personal Data" section below. 

## 4\. Sharing Your Personal Data

  * To provide customer support services. 
  * To detect, prevent, and investigate fraud and misuse of our services, other illegal activities, and data breaches.

Please refer to the websites of business partners for their Privacy Policies and other information. 

**Priceline's Agents and Vendors** : Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us.

As part of that process, Priceline may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that Priceline, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction. In such cases, the acquiring company would be required to honor the privacy promises in this Privacy & Cookies Policy or obtain your consent to any material changes to how your Personal Data will be handled.

In certain jurisdictions, such sharing may be considered a "sale" of your Personal Data and you may have the right under applicable law to opt-out of or object to such sharing 

## 5\. Your Choices Regarding Our Collection and Use of Your Data for Marketing and Other Purposes

As explained above, you may choose not to provide us with Personal Data; however, doing so may prevent us from providing you with requested information and carrying out transactions.
