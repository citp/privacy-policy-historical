This privacy policy sets out the basis on which your personal data will be processed by us as the data controller of your personal data for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act"). Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat them.

 **Information we may collect from you**

We may collect and process the following data about you:

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on the Site. This includes information provided at the time of registration or at the time of posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by Haymarket or when you report a problem with the Site. 
  * If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. 
  * Haymarket may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes although you do not have to respond to them. 
  * Details of your visits to the Site and the resources that you access. 



**IP Addresses and Cookies**

We may collect information about your computer including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. These are data about our users' browsing actions and patterns and do not identify any individual.

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of a browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. We will only use cookies to facilitate your use of the Site. We do not use cookies to store sensitive information about you.

If you wish to stop cookies being stored in your computer in future, please refer to your browser manufacturer's instructions by clicking "Help" in your browser menu. Further information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at [www.AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)

 **Where we store your personal data**  
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have provided you with a password, which enables you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. As stated above, it is important you do not share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. So, whilst we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot ensure the security of data transmitted by you to the Site. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we will use security procedures and features to prevent unauthorised access to it. 

**Uses made of the information**

We may use information held about you in the following ways:

  * to ensure that the Site's content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer 
  * to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you; if you would prefer not to have your email address used in this way please let us know by sending an email to [help@printweek.com](mailto:help@printweek.com)
  * to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service where you  
choose to do so; 
  * to notify you about changes to our service. 



We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries as defined in section 736 of the Company Act 1985.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * in the event that we offer to sell any assets in which case we may disclose your personal data to the potential purchaser of such assets; 
  * if substantially all of Haymarket's assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be transferred to such third party; 
  * if we are required to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or any other agreement; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Haymarket, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for protection against credit risk and fraud. 



We do not disclose individual information to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We would comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience using the personal data we have collected from you and from others. 

**Your rights**

You have the right to request us not to disclose any of your personal data or information or to pass information to third parties. We will usually inform you before collecting your data, if we intend to disclose your information to any third party and you can exercise that right by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also notify us by contacting us at [help@printweek.com](mailto:help@printweek.com).

The Site may from time to time contain links to and from partner and/or affiliate websites. If you follow a link to their sites, please note that these sites have their own privacy policy and that Haymarket does not accept any responsibility or liability for protection of personal data which you may submit to a third party's site. You are recommended to check the wording of the relevant privacy policies before you submit any personal data to those sites. 

**Access to information**

The Act gives you various rights including the right to access information held about you. Questions about this privacy policy can be addressed to [help@printweek.com](mailto:help@printweek.com).
