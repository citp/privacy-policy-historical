# Privacy Policy | PriceBaba

Greetings Dear Users of PriceBaba. This page is to enlighten you with our policies that are in place to do one and only one thing - respect your privacy. As users of this website, we assume that you agree to this policy and be well informed that PriceBaba will not participate in any activity that will misuse your personal information. 

PriceBaba uses cookies to identify you as a user when you're using our service. This is used to show you useful information, for instance, products that you have viewed in the past. We also use this information for our analytical purposes to make PriceBaba better every passing day. We use social networking plugins like Facebook/Twitter at various places on PriceBaba to let you easily share our content with people in your online social circles. Cookies that may be used by these services are beyond our control and we cannot take any ownership for their behavior. 

We also use services that allow us to trace a user's city based on your IP address. This is only used to serve you relevant city /district level information as fast as possible. To get your exact location / area for searching retailers near you, we also provide an option to you for sharing your accurate location either using HTML5 detection or GPS on your device. Location data collected from these requests is only used to serve you relevant local content and make it faster for you to navigate our service. We may also cache some of this information on the client end (generally your browser) or our servers to make your browsing experience on PriceBaba faster. 

You may be asked your personal details like logging into PriceBaba via Facebook, Twitter, Google or via giving your email address or phone number. These details are asked only because we want to get in touch with you when you, say, use our Price Reminder service. Also, your credentials are the means for us to confirm that you are a genuine user of our service. 

Just because we have your contact details does not mean we will or ever intend to send you, any communication other than the service you have subscribed / asked for. 

In the future, if we feel there's something we need to inform you regarding privacy, we will update this page and hope you will take note of it. 

We love a clean Internet, an environment that inspires trust. We hate spam and we have no intentions to unethically sell your contact information stored with us. 

For any questions regarding your privacy, you can write to us [here](http://pricebaba.com/feedback).
