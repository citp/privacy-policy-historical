Cookies are pieces of information that a Web Site transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that.  However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web Site if you do so.  Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web.  Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify customers or passwords.  Credit card information is not stored in cookies.  


**We use cookies for the following reasons:**

(i) To identify who you are and to access your account information;   
(ii) To estimate our audience size and patterns;
