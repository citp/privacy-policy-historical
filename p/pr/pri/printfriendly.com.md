# Privacy Policy

At PrintFriendly we don't just treat people how we'd like to be treated... we treat people how we'd like our grandmothers treated. That's right - we're on our best behavior!

If you have questions please contact our [support team](http://support.printfriendly.com/).

We have two products that have different Privacy Policies.

  1. PrintFriendly Pro - A client-side technology used by websites.
  2. PrintFriendly.com - Our website used by individuals and customers of PrintFriendly Pro.

### Protection of Personally-Identifying Information

PrintFriendly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PrintFriendly behalf or to provide services available at PrintFriendly's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PrintFriendly's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PrintFriendly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PrintFriendly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PrintFriendly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PrintFriendly, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of PrintFriendly and have supplied your email address, PrintFriendly may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with PrintFriendly and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. PrintFriendly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Business Transfers

If PrintFriendly, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that PrintFriendly goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of PrintFriendly may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, PrintFriendly may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in PrintFriendly's sole discretion. PrintFriendly encourages visitors to check this page for changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
