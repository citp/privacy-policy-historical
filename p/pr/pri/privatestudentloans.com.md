_Please note: If you apply for a loan, loan consolidation service, or other product or service, you may be redirected to the website of one of our third-party service providers (banks, lenders, facilitators, service providers, guarantors, and marketers); other links on our sites may also direct you to third party websites. This policy covers only what we do with the information you or the third-party provides to us; we are not responsible for, nor can we control the privacy practices and policies of these third party entities. We encourage you to review their policies carefully._

While these advertising networks may obtain some of your Technical Information, we do not share your name or other information that can personally identify you, or any data from loan application pages.
