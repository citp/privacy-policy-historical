**Priscilla of Boston's commitment to privacy**

Priscilla of Boston is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and maintains the following privacy policy to protect the personally identifiable information you provide online. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

**What information do we collect on this website?**

Priscilla of Boston collects information online to fulfill your requests. When you join our registry, we need to know your name and mailing address. While it is not required, we also ask for additional information about you, as well as specific bridal party and wedding information. This allows us to send you information about special events and offers, and other information custom-tailored to your needs. 

We use a third party advertising company to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. To help make our information more useful to our visitors, we may collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site, and about your interaction with our ads. For example, we may keep track of how many of our ads you had seen before visiting our site using technology such as cookies, action tags, Web Beacons or GIF tags, which we may place at various sections within our web site. We do not collect any personally identifiable information through the use of this technology. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Our site uses cookies to make sure you are not shown the same content repeatedly, to deliver information that is specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

From time to time, we may share anonymous information with our ad agencies in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our site. We may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or the process of opting out of these cookies, please [click here](http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy).

**Will we disclose the information collected to outside parties?**

The personally identifiable information we collect online is sent to the Priscilla of Boston salon in your area so the salon can provide you with information regarding special events and offers in your area. Priscilla of Boston may choose to share your personally identifiable information within our family of companies and with other selected retailers, so that you can be provided with offers we believe would be attractive to our customers. If you wish to opt out of these offers, please send an email to [mkent@priscillaofboston.com](mailto:mkent@priscillaofboston.com). 

We also may use non-identifying and aggregate information to improve the design of our web site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X-number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y-number of women who filled out our registration form are from the northeast U.S., but we will not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

**Coremetrics**

We have carefully selected a company, Coremetrics, that will assist us in better understanding your use of our site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf that will educate us on such things as search engine referral, how you navigate around our site, unique visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information. Priscilla of Boston does not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information. Coremetrics analyzes the information it collects on our behalf and returns it to Priscilla of Boston through a secure web connection. The information and analysis will be used to assist us in better understanding your use of our web site and how to better serve you. Coremetrics is contractually prohibited from using our data for any other purposes and is required to maintain all information collected and the analysis in strictest confidence.

**How does Priscilla of Boston protect customer information?**

We protect the customer data we collect. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**A special note concerning children's privacy:**

Protecting the safety and privacy of children is important to us. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided our web site with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian send us an e-mail at [mkent@priscillaofboston.com](mailto:mkent@priscillaofboston.com), and we will delete the information about the child from our files.

**Is there anything else I should know about Internet privacy?**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In addition, the privacy policies of other web sites will vary, while some may have no stated privacy policy. 

In short, if you provide personally identifiable information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. It is ultimately your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your personally identifiable information to the extent you feel comfortable. We encourage you to be careful and to ask questions before you disclose your personally identifiable information to others.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please send us an e-mail at [mkent@priscillaofboston.com](mailto:mkent@priscillaofboston.com).
