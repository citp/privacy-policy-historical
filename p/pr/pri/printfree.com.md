# Privacy Policy

**Our Privacy Policy   ** We at Printfree.com respect your right to privacy.

  We do not collect and sell your personal information   
to marketers, or anyone else.

The only data we collect are common web access logs,   
to help us analyze which areas of our site are visited the   
most, which time of the day is busiest, and other broad information.

Since we require no memberships, and conduct no monetary   
transactions on this site, we do not offer secure encrypted pages. 

Please remember this when you create one of our user interactive   
customizable items, i.e. customizable calendars, and don't enter   
any personal information that you would not want viewed by anyone.  
The first field is saved by default to our results for evaluation purposes.

When visiting one of our affiliate merchants to make a purchase, they   
will handle the transaction on their site, and provide the security they   
deem necessary. Many of our merchants are highly respected in their   
industry and have been handling transactions for many years.

What about cookies?   
We don't have any of our own cookies, but some of our affiliate partners   
do use cookies for the simple purpose of identifying that you did in fact   
click through on an ad from our site, so that we will receive credit for the   
click through or sale. These aren't the bad privacy invading cookies you   
read about in the newspaper, and generally automatically expire, and take   
very little space on your hard drive.

Thank you for visiting, now you can relax and enjoy this site as it was intended!
