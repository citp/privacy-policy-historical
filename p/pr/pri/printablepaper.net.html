				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				
<p>
Savetz Publishing takes online privacy very seriously. We actively protect the privacy of users of our web sites
and people who subscribe to our mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
<b>Subscription Lists &amp; Email Addresses</b> -- To receive certain services such as mailing lists, you must provide us
with your name and email address -- without it, we can't send you anything. We hold the names and email addresses of subscribers
in the strictest confidence, and will not disclose specific subscriber information 
unless complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, or ensuring the security of our network and services.
Subscription lists can be accessed by only a few members of the Savetz Publishing
staff and are well protected against theft, tampering, and misuse.
Aggregate information about subscription lists (such as the total number of subscribers) may be disclosed.

features. As with other web access, this information generally cannot be associated with any particular
user; in any case, query information is not disclosed to anyone outside our staff.
