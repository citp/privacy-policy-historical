# PrinterOn - Privacy Policy

PrinterOn has created this statement to describe our firm commitment to privacy. This policy explains how we use personal and corporate information provided by visitors to our web site, www.PrinterOn.net.

## Registration and General Use

PrinterOn's registration form requires you to give us contact information such as name and email address. We use contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company, or occasionally important information related to our service. If you indicate your approval during registration, we may also send you information on behalf of strategic partners that we think will be of interest. All PrinterOn users can refuse such email as part of the registration process and any email we send includes an easy way to unsubscribe. We do not sell or give out the PrinterOn email list. All information entered by you during registration and customization is protected by our privacy policy. We never make any individual information available to advertisers or partners. We may describe the PrinterOn users, only in general aggregate terms, to potential advertisers and partners. One of PrinterOn's goals is to provide a means for printer owners and users to ensure that they are printing to the correct place with suitable formatting and permissions. To do this, we require registration to mitigate the likelihood of misuse of the PrinterOn service, and provide an audit-trail capability for our subscribers. Our site contains links to other sites. Because PrinterOn is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, we recommend viewers refer to their posted privacy policies. 

## Security

PrinterOn has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information collected through registration of you, your printer, and your organization is stored in a secure server in the PrinterOn data center to guarantee against unauthorized access.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may revise this policy from time to time. In that event, the revised policy will be posted on our web site, and any changes will be effective at that point.

## Feedback

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this web site, you can contact us at [support@printeron.com](mailto:support@printeron.com).
