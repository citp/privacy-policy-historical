Lifetouch is a trusted provider of photographic products and services to communities, schools, churches, day care centers and families throughout the United States and Canada. At Lifetouch, we are sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to our websites. Though we do not obtain any personal information that individually identifies you (e.g., your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) unless you affirmatively provide it to us, many visitors do choose to provide us with such information. This policy explains our online information practices pertaining to this website and the choices you, as a visitor to this site, can make about the collection and use of your information.

#### What personal information is collected at Lifetouch.com? How is it used?

At the Lifetouch Site, we only collect personally identifiable information about you to the extent you specifically provide it to us. This includes, for example, the information you provide when you contact us through this website to place an order, contact customer service, register for a service, respond to a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes online. We use this information you share with us

  * to provide the products or services or benefits you request,
  * to develop and improve our products and services,
  * to improve the content of our site and its usefulness to you, and
  * for our own marketing and promotional purposes.



Lifetouch does not sell, trade or share the information you provide us through this website with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes. We reserve the right to share such information among the Lifetouch Companies and you may receive product and service information from any of them. Information you submit to jcpenneyportraits.com and/or targetstudios.com (operated by Lifetouch Portrait Studios Inc.) may also be shared with the host organization, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. or Target Corporation respectively. Finally, we may also share this information with outside vendors and organizations that provide support services to us such as helping us fulfill customer orders, process credit card orders and the like. If so, these parties are authorized to use the information solely in conjunction with the specific service they provide to or on behalf of Lifetouch.

We may also be required to share information you provide us through this website in other, limited circumstances in which we may share or transfer the information you provide us through this website, for example, to respond to judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.

#### Safeguarding information

Within the Lifetouch Companies, we protect against unauthorized disclosures by limiting access to employees and contractors of the Lifetouch Companies who need the information to do their jobs. We also give them guidelines for adhering to our confidentiality policies.

In the limited circumstances that we provide information to outside companies, we restrict it to only the information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts.

We require that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained.
