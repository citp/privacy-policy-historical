# Privacy Policy | Precision Nutrition

We are Precision Nutrition Inc. of 51 Wolseley Street, Suite 502, Toronto, Ontario M5T 1A4 and 1 Yonge Street, Suite 1801, Toronto, Ontario, M5E 1W7. (“Precision” or “we”, “us”, “our”). We recognize the importance of privacy and the sensitivity of personal information (defined below). Precision is subject to various privacy statutes, including Canada's federal _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act,_ all substantially similar provincial legislation, and the European Union’s _General Data Protection Regulation_ (collectively, the “Privacy Laws”).

This Privacy Policy outlines how we safeguard and manage the personal information that you submit to us or that your personal coach provides to us about you. We are the data controller of personal information that we may collect, process and hold about you, unless we advise you otherwise.

## Your Privacy Rights

Under the Privacy Laws, Precision is required to collect, use and disclose personal information only by lawful and fair means. To ensure this accountability, we have developed this policy, and trained our staff about our policies and practices.

## What is “personal information”?

Personal information is any information that identifies you, or by which your identity could be deduced.

## What Types of Services does Precision Offer?

Precision offers the following types of services:

_Precision Nutrition Certification Programs - Training to Become a Fitness / Nutrition Coach_

  * _Level 1 Certification Program_ – this is a self-paced training program for fitness / nutrition coaching that gives a basic overview of fitness, nutrition and coaching principles. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.
  * _Level 2 Certification Program_ – this is a cohort-based program (meaning that it is an online class conducted at set times and for a set duration during the year) specializing in advanced fitness and nutrition coaching skills and strategies. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.



_ProCoach Service - Independent Third Party ProCoaches and Their Clients_

  * This is a program offered to independent third party fitness / nutrition coaches whereby they use our online software platform and curriculum materials as tools to develop their own fitness / nutrition programs for coaching their clients. The ProCoaches and their clients have separate contractual arrangements between them for the coaching services of the ProCoach.  There are two aspects to data handling in this situation to note:
    * With respect to the personal information that Precision collects about the ProCoaches themselves, Precision is the controller and processor of the data.
    * Where the ProCoach asks a client to set up an account with Precision to follow the ProCoach’s program, with respect to the personal information that Precision receives from that client, Precision is the processor of the ProCoach client data, but the ProCoach is the controller of the data about his or her clients.

_Precision Nutrition Coaching Program - Online Coaching for Individuals_

    * This is a program whereby individuals join our online Precision Nutrition Coaching Program for fitness and nutrition coaching by Precision’s own coaches. Precision is the controller and processor of the personal information collected for this program.



## What types of personal information do  
we collect?

If you sign up for our Precision Nutrition Coaching Program or a Precision Nutrition Certification Program, you will be required to provide your name, email address, and mobile phone number.  At the time of registration you will be asked to provide payment card information (including your credit card number, expiry date, and CVC/CVV) in order to register; however, this payment card information is sent directly to our payment card processor.  Precision only receives a random electronic token over an encrypted connection from the payment processor that confirms the transaction has been completed.  We do not receive a copy of your payment card information.

If you are a client of a ProCoach, your ProCoach will forward to us your name, email address and program type for us to invite you to sign up.

If you have registered for the Precision Nutrition Coaching Program you will need to provide additional information such as alternate contact information, your full home address, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, physical measurements or attributes, and other more detailed information about your lifestyle (including but not limited to: employment, preferences, habits, personal routine) in order create a program account. Precision will also collect limited medical information about your health and well-being in order to better assess and develop a structured coaching program to help you meet your fitness and health goals. This additional information is considered sensitive data, and is treated as such, requiring your explicit consent for us to collect this information.  We will also require confirmation from you that your doctor has approved your following our program or if you are not able to provide this confirmation, we will require that you sign this a medical waiver, which will be supplied to you at the time of collection of your personal information.  If you are a ProCoach client, your ProCoach may ask us to collect some or all of the additional information described above on his or her behalf.  You should check with your ProCoach on the ProCoach’s privacy policy for how he or she will be using and disclosing this information.

As a tool to help you assess your progress, Precision will ask you to upload photographs of yourself periodically and to provide your measurements, including girth measurements and weight (around once a month). Uploading of photographs is optional and you can request that they be anonymized. The measurement recording feature is similarly optional.  You can choose to stop uploading photos or providing measurements at any time. Should you choose to upload photos or measurements, these photos will only be viewed by Precision coaching staff or, if these photos have been requested by your personal ProCoach coach, then they may be viewed by your ProCoach and will not be otherwise used or disclosed unless you provide your express permission for Precision to do so. Please check with your ProCoach on the ProCoach’s privacy policy to find out how he or she will be using and disclosing these photographs.

If you register for either of our Precision Nutrition Certification Programs, we will need your shipping address in order to provide you with a textbook.  We will also ask you to provide other information around your experience and credentials as a health and fitness professional.

If you are purchasing any of our PN Guides, we will need your full name, company, phone number(s), email, and shipping and billing address in order to effect the transaction and send you the product. As noted above, our third party payment processor will collect payment card information directly from you on our behalf, but we will receive a random electronic token confirming the transaction.  In addition, Precision will ask if you are a fitness professional or if you otherwise work in fitness.

Note: If you are a client of a ProCoach, you and the ProCoach will enter into a separate contractual arrangement that does not involve Precision.  Precision is not responsible for and disclaims all warranties and liabilities with respect to your contractual arrangements with your ProCoach, including, without limitation, any payment arrangements to which you and your ProCoach may agree.
