# Privacy Policy — Pre-K Pages

Our readers’ privacy and trust are important to us. We never disclose or sell our readers information to third parties.

**Website Visitors**

Like most websites, Pre-KPages.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our website. Pre-KPages also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Pre-KPages.com choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask commenters to provide a name, URL and email address. Pre-KPages collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with us. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Pre-KPages may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the website. However, we do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pre-KPages uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of Pre-KPages.com, and their website access preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Pre-KPages, with the drawback that certain features of this site may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Pre-KPages.com may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
