You may choose not to accept cookies using your browser. See our [Cookie Policy](http://www.simon.com/legal/cookies) for more information. 

When you access the App using your mobile device, we collect your mobile phone number and the unique device ID number of the mobile device; the unique identifier assigned to your mobile device for advertising purposes, such as your Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) on iOS devices or your Google Advertising ID (AAID) on Android devices; your Bluetooth MAC address (a unique number that is assigned to your Bluetooth radio by the manufacturer); as well as information about your mobile device model, operating system and version, and/or mobile communications carrier. 

**Location Information.** We collect location data when you use the Sites that is provided by your ISP or a third party data provider, such as your ZIP code, city and state. When you access the App using your mobile device, we collect the location data (such as your current latitude/longitude coordinates) that is provided by your mobile device (if you enable that feature on your device). We use Bluetooth (BLE) Beacons and Wi-Fi technologies within our malls that may communicate with your device and identify your device's location if your device is Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi enabled and you have these radio(s) on. If you use one of our public Wi-Fi networks to access the Internet, your use will be logged and certain [ Wi-Fi specific terms of use ](http://www.simon.com/legal/wifi-terms-of-use) will apply to that use. 

You may adjust the settings on most devices to allow the Sites or App to gather, or to disable it from gathering, location positioning data. Certain features, such as a mall locator, may not work as effectively if you disable location positioning data. 

We also may have arrangements with third parties to collect the foregoing data as service providers to us. 

**Do Not Track.** Do not track is a voluntary program among Internet advertisers that is intended to give users the ability to opt-out of interest-based advertising. There are a few ways in which your computer may transmit a "do not track" signal to certain websites and online services you visit, and currently no standard has been established. We do not respond to do not track signals, and the settings in your browser will have no effect on the Site. 

**Platform operation.** We use the information we collect to operate, maintain and improve the Platform and our products and services, such as to respond to comments and questions and provide customer service; send information including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages; communicate about promotions, upcoming events, and other products and services offered by us and/or by third parties, including through the use of contextual and interest-based advertising; link or combine the information we collect with other information we get from third parties, to help understand your interests and provide you with better service; protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized or illegal activity; provide and deliver the products and services you request; identify you as a user in our system, such as when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our [Terms of Use](http://www.simon.com/legal) or to protect the Platform, customers, or other individuals; facilitate the creation of and secure any accounts you created on our Platform; develop and improve marketing and advertising for the Platform; and/or for other purposes in operating the Platform. 

We may create de-identified information records and "aggregate data" reports about how users use the Platform, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Sites or the Apps, which may be derived from technical and/or personal information. This information cannot be readily tied back to you, your account, your web browser or your mobile device. We may use this de-identified information for business purposes, such as to enhance the content of and improve the Platform, for example by allowing us and third parties authorized by us to ascertain how often individuals use areas of the Platform so that we may focus on and improve those areas. 

We may use technical data we gather to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services while you are using the Platform. 

We may use your mobile phone number for the purposes stated herein, including for mobile SMS/MMS messaging or content in accordance with our [mobile text terms of use.](http://www.simon.com/legal/mobile-text-help)

**Location Information.** We may use the location and Wi-Fi information gathered to generatereports, such as foot traffic at our malls, which we may share with retailers and third parties to improve the consumer experience at our malls, and in order to provide specific services, such as locating a nearby mall when you make such a request. We may also use this information to send you news about the mall, such as promotions from mall retailers, and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Third parties may process location data as service providers to us, such as to facilitate marketing campaigns or to perform fraud detection and analysis on our behalf. 

**Advertising.** We use analytics services, advertising companies, advertising networks and advertising exchanges to help analyze how users use and navigate the Platform and to engage in advertising on our behalf, on behalf of the retailers for which products and services are available within Shop Premium Outlets and on behalf of mall retailers, including contextual advertising and interest-based advertising. These companies may use data about your visits to the Platform and other websites or mobile applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you which are offered by us or by our retailers. Those companies are instructed to follow industry guidelines with regard to interest-based advertising, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's principles for online behavioral advertising. Among other things, the ads that are displayed to you should have the AdChoices icon or a similar mechanism which you may click to direct you to a website where you may opt-out of interest-based advertising. If you would like more information about this practice and how to opt-out of receiving communications from these third-party advertising companies, please visit [this link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). 

Some retailers may employ their own advertising campaigns via the Platform which adhere to differing practices. You may learn about a specific retailer's practices by reviewing that retailer's privacy policy. 

Various data collected for advertising purposes may be restricted through cookies. See our [Cookie Policy](http://www.simon.com/legal/cookies) __ for more information.

We may also share such information with third parties that provide marketing and advertising on our behalf, as well as with our retailers. 

**Your transactions.** We may share your information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, such as to purchase merchandise or a Simon Giftcard and have it shipped to you, or for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information, or with your consent, or to third parties designated by you. We may share financial information with our third-party payment processing company, our credit card gateway and fraud detection company, our remote checkout bot company and any applicable retailers. 

To fulfill a purchase on Shop Premium Outlets, we will share your purchase and shipping information with our third party e-commerce enabler, currently Two Tap, Inc., which will provide the information to the retailer(s) from which your purchase is made. The use of your information by these parties is subject to their respective privacy notices. Generally, they will use the information for customer service, fulfillment, shipping and returns. The retailer may pass your information to third parties, such as the shipping carrier (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc.). We may also share your purchase and contact information with third parties that provide marketing and advertising services on our behalf, as well as with our retailers. 

**Social Media.** We may share certain data, such as your telephone or e-mail contact information, with social media outlets, like Facebook and Instagram, in connection with our agreement to share such information with them, in order to provide more targeted advertisements about goods and services from us or mall retailers that may be of interest to you.

We may also share aggregate location data with Shop Premium Outlets Retailers. 

**Third Party Service Providers.** We may share your information with third party service providers that assist us in operating the Platform, for and on our behalf, such as a hosting company or e-mail provider. They are instructed to use the information only to assist us in operating the Platform. We may also share with third parties your information with us, such as sharing your feedback with our vendors to improve the Platform. We may also share your information with third parties that provide marketing and advertising on our behalf, as well as with our retailers. 

We may share de-identified data concerning retail consumer behavior with third parties, including entities with whom we have entered into an agreement to provide such de-identified data for analytics or marketing purposes. 

We may also share with our retailers de-identified segment information, which is information that does not identify you personally, but allows the retailers to know more generally the products being purchased through, and the consumers who are using, the Platform. 

**Required by law or to protect interests.** We may disclose your information to (i) comply with laws, rules, regulations, legal processes and governmental requests; (ii) enforce this Notice and our [Terms of Use](http://www.simon.com/legal), including investigation of potential violations hereof and thereof; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (such as for fraud protection, credit risk reduction and spam/malware prevention); (iv) respond to user support requests; (v) avoid liability, or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of anyone else (such as when user is believed to be in violation of our [Terms of Use](http://www.simon.com/legal)); and/or (vi) protect the rights, property and safety of our companies, partners, contractors, customers, users and the public (such as to report suspected illegal activity to law enforcement). 

**Corporate activity.** If we sell assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity or if we are acquired by or merged with another entity, we may share with such entity information about users of the Platform that is related to that part of our business that is sold to or acquired by or merged with the other entity. 

**Financial information.** We do not collect financial information. If you make a purchase on Shop Premium Outlets, any financial information you provide is collected by our payment processor, currently Spreedly, Inc., and is governed by their privacy notice. To process your purchase, the payment processor will pass your information on to a third party e-commerce enabler, currently Two Tap, Inc., which will provide the information to the retailer from which your purchase is made. The use of that information is governed by Two Tap's privacy notice. The retailer(s) will fulfill your purchase. We ask the retailer to use your information only to fulfill the purchase. You may check the applicable retailer's privacy notice if you have questions regarding their use of information. 

We endeavor to protect the security of the information collected through the Platform and implement generally accepted standards of information technology security designed to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. It is not possible, however, to guarantee the security or integrity of information disclosed online due to, among other things, technological limitations and the fact that no data accessible through or transmitted via the Internet is completely secure. Shop Premium Outlets orders involve processing of data by third parties, such as retailers, online gift card providers, ticket agents, credit card processing companies, fraud detection service providers, issuing banks, card network issuers, shipping/fulfillment companies, and other parties in order to complete an order. Those parties with which we contract are required to maintain reasonable measures designed to safeguard the security of the data they process; however, we do not otherwise have control over and are not responsible for their handling of such data. 

The Platform may have links to third party websites, services and applications, such as websites hosted by third party retailers (collectively, **“Third Party Sites”** ). When you click on such a link, you will leave the Platform and be directed to the Third Party Site and when you leave the Platform, you and are no longer subject to the terms of this Notice. This Notice does not apply to Third Party Sites, and we do not review or endorse, and are not responsible for, any Third Party Sites, the content therein, or their privacy practices. This Notice also does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Simon's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 

Residents of other countries outside the U.S., such as the European Union, may have other rights. As stated in our [Terms of Use](http://www.simon.com/legal), while you may be able to setup an account as a user outside the U.S., we make no assurances or representations of any kind that the Platform is suitable for use in the country in which you reside. Currently, users outside the U.S. may not purchase merchandise through SPO. 

By accessing the Platform, establishing an account or making a purchase, you consent to the processing of your personal information as provided in this Notice. You may withdraw that consent by contacting us at [privacy@simon.com](mailto:privacy@simon.com). You are required to provide certain personal information in order to open and maintain an account. Your failure to provide such information may preclude you from establishing an account or may subject your account to termination. An account may be required to make certain types of online purchases, as a guest style checkout option is not always available across all of our Sites and Apps. 

If at any point you believe the personal information we process about you is incorrect, you may access your account and modify it there, or otherwise request to see the information and to have it corrected or deleted by contacting us at [privacy@simon.com](mailto:privacy@simon.com). If you wish to object to or raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal information, you may contact our Data Protection Officer who will investigate the matter.
