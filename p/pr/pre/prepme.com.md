# PrepMe: Prepare for the future

We at PrepMe, Inc. and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information you share with us. 

You can utilize most of this site's free features without giving us any personal information. For the parts of PrepMe's site where a free service is offered with a subscription, you may opt-in to receive further information from our partners. However, for specialized paid services that require personal information PrepMe, will never release any of the personal information you give us. Personal Information refers to any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information. 

Most of PrepMe's services are not intended to be used by children under 13 years of age and accordingly we do not collect personal information from these individuals. PrepMe's new Precocious Program is designed for students starting in 6th grade and thus may have users who are under the age of 13. To comply with COPPA regulations, students who are under the age of 13 are not allowed to register directly and a parent/guardian must register under his or her own name to maintain their child's privacy. 

If you choose to provide us with your personal information on this site, we may transfer that information within PrepMe, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

PrepMe strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, we intend to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.
