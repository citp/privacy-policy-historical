<div class="large bold">What Information Do We Collect?</div><br>
MedsChat is the sole owner of the information collected on the MedsChat.com website. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our website.<br><br>
(i) In order to participate in the discussion threads, we request that you provide your name (it may be a pseudonym for anonymity) and optionally your email address; providing your email address enables us to notify you whenever somebody posts a reply to your message as well as receive our daily health newsletter if you choose to subscribe to it.<br><br>

Providing your email address enables us to notify you whenever somebody posts a reply to your messages, receive administrative communications from us, as well as receive our daily health newsletter if you choose to subscribe to it.<br><br>
If you choose to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your email address to send it to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you with a way to unsubscribe. Please see "Opting Out" for more details.<br><br>
We may collect and store certain information automatically. This information will not be shared with anyone beyond the website support staff, except when required by law enforcement investigation (such as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or subpoena), and will be used only as a source of anonymous statistical information. This information may include:<br>

<ul>

<li>Web address of the site from which You linked directly to our site.</li>

We may use statistical data to help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.<br><br>
You may also choose to provide us with personal information, by sending e-mail with questions or comments or by filling out an online form and submitting it to us through our website. We use this information to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Gather the requested information.</li>

<li>Follow-up as appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<strong><em>We do not sell, share, rent or trade transfer any personal information to third parties for their promotional use.</em></strong><br><br>
However, your email message, question, or comment may be forwarded to other MedsChat employees who may be better able to help You. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.<br><br>

<div id="cookies_section">
<div class="large bold">Cookies</div><br>
Cookies are small files that websites use to store data on your computer. Most browsers are set up to automatically accept cookies. If you choose to block cookies (through your browser settings or other means), you can still use our site, but your ability to use or access some areas may be limited. Cookies are used in conjunction with our service in a variety of ways:<br><br>

<h3>1. User Experience</h3><br>
Cookies can help to make navigation around our site more swift and prevent you from having to reenter certain information that you have previously given us. By using any of our online forms to participate in discussion threads, send us a message, email yourself an rx discount card, or subscribe to our health newsletter, your email address (plus your name if it is collected) is stored in a cookie so that you do not need to reenter it the next time you visit our site. Please note that this cookie is NOT shared with any outside parties. Furthermore, if you select the option "I'm on a public or shared computer" before submitting the form, we will not store this information inside a cookie. If you wish to clear this previously stored information <a href="/privacy.asp?action=clear-email-cookie">click here</a>.<br><br>

<h3>2. Measuring Our Visitors (Analytics)</h3><br>
We use Google Analytics to measure visits to our website. This records how you arrived here, what pages you view within our site, and some basic information about your computer and location. Please note that this information is anonymized and does not tell us who you are. It simply shows us that <span class="italic">somebody</span> visited our site. Collecting data in this way allows us to discover how and when visitors use our site and to determine the most and least useful pages. Ultimately, analytics software allows us to make our website better. If you wish to learn more or opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit:<br>

<h3>3. Advertising</h3><br>
We work with third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. In the course of serving such ads, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie through your browser. They may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, and we do not have access to read or write these cookies. If you would like more information about this practice and opting out you can visit:<br><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a><br><br>

<em>Google's DoubleClick Cookie:</em> The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks.

Our third-party partners may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers' or Users' personally identifiable information.<br><br>

Our servers are located in a secured facility and we employ firewalls for additional protection. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>
