# The Santa Rosa Press Democrat // Privacy Statement

This user information privacy policy describes how the Web sites maintained by pressdemocrat.com, sonomatraveler.com, monstercoupons.com, searchsonoma.com, and all sub-sections-collect and utilize users' personally identifiable information. It is our policy that a user controls:

* What personal identifiable information is collected.  

* What pressdemocrat.com sites can do with that information. 

Pressdemocrat.com will not disclose a user's personally identifiable information to any third party without the user's express permission except where users sign up for certain services which will be subject to the opt-out provisions set forth below. 

**Information Not Collected:** A user can access our Web sites and utilize many of our services without providing any information at all. Nor do we follow a user's browsing path outside of our Web sites. 

We do develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. The people that make it possible for visitors to use pressdemocrat.com for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers the identity of a user who saw or clicked on their advertisements unless the user has expressly given permission to do so. 

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), pressdemocrat.com does not collect or store any personal information, even in aggregate, about children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical. 

**Usage Tracking:** Pressdemocrat.com does track usage patterns on our sites and breaks down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). However, we do not match this information with users' personally identifiable information. 

**Data Security:** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. 

**Affiliated and Linked Sites** Pressdemocrat.com expects its partners, advertisers, and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, third-party Internet sites, and content providers accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. Pressdemocrat.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through co-branded, affiliated or linked sites. 

While on our site, you may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers or promotional partners. The placement of cookies by third-party servers is common on the Internet. Pressdemocrat.com does not control the use of these cookies or have access to the resulting information. (See the section on Cookies below for more details.) 

Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information on message boards or in chat areas of pressdemocrat.com, that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.

The user must provide a valid e-mail address for both the sender and the recipient in order to ensure that the service functions properly and to inform the recipient who sent the story. There is also an option to include a name which is only used for the e-mail salutation. None of this information is used for any other purpose.
