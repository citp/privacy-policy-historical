Information Collected from Social Media: If you log onto our Sites through a social media
platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others, we and the social media service
may share certain information about you and your activities. Your interaction with social media
typically allows the social media platform to collect some information about you through cookies
they place on your device and other tracking mechanisms. In some cases, the social media
platform may recognize you through its cookies even when you do not interact with their
application. Please visit the respective privacy policies of third party social media platforms to
better understand their data collection practices and controls they make available to you.
Location Information: We log IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, and the location of your

4849-0353-3933v.1 0059240-000010


cases, we collect information voluntarily from you. Each special offer or event will be governed
by its own privacy terms. We will notify you if we plan to share your information with third
parties, except for in circumstances where the information is shared in the aggregate and
cannot be attributed to a particular person or response. You can always decline to share your
information by not participating in these special events or offers.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OR ABOUT YOU
We may use information you give us or we collect about you to:
        Communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to fulfill your requests, or to provide
         you with offers and information about our Services or services of our affiliates and
         partners. With respect to your account with us, we may connect with you about news
         stories, features to which you may have access, surveys about our Services, and other
         important information like legal notices.
        To optimize, improve, and maintain our Sites including research and analytics regarding
         use of the Sites, identifiers that will allow us to remember you when you leave and return
         to our Sites.
        To provide and improve our products and services, both online and offline, to better
         understand and serve our users. We do so by collecting interest-based behavior
         information.
        To provide and manage the Services you request by processing your transactions at
         your request, authenticating your identity as our customer, sending you subscription
         material, electronic newsletters, and other features.
        Deliver interest-based advertising on our Sites as well as other websites and
         applications. We may use your information to deliver targeted advertisements, and offers
         or promotions tailored to you, on behalf of ourselves and other advertisers both as part
         of our Services and on other websites and mediums.
        Detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal or
         fraudulent. When we believe it is necessary, we will protect, enforce, and defend our
         legal rights, privacy, safety or property, or that of others. We comply with all applicable
         laws.
We may combine information collected on our Sites about you with: (1) information we obtain
from our business records, (2) information provided by third parties, (3) information collected
from your browser or device; or (4) other usage information collected on our Sites not specific to
any one individual.
We may use information collected from or about you to create aggregated or de-identified data
that does not identify you. Once the data is properly de-identified and aggregated we may share
it with third parties for their purposes.
INTERNET-BASED ADVERTISING
The Sites use the information we collect about you, such as behavioral, demographic and
preference information to provide you with advertising and offers that are more pertinent to you.
4849-0353-3933v.1 0059240-000010


We partner with third party advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Sites, as
well as on other websites and applications about our products and services that may be of
interest to you.
Some of our Sites may also include advertisements or promotion content for unaffiliated
products and services. All of this means users see advertising that is most likely to interest
them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive,
improving both the viewer’s experience and the effectiveness of the advertisements.
The advertisements you see may be based on information collected through cookies, web
beacons and other tracking technologies from our Sites and on other third-party websites you
visit and mobile applications you use that participate in our advertising networks.
      Our Cookies: We may place a PressDemocrat.com cookie on your computer with a
         unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over
         and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique
         visitors that have viewed a particular advertisement or visited a particular Web page.
      Others’ Cookies: Third parties may use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage
         across other websites and mobile applications in their networks beyond the Sites. We do
         not share information that personally identifies you with unaffiliated third parties for their
         own uses. But third parties, with sufficient data from other sources, may be able to
         identify you. The information we receive from online advertising trackers allows us to
         generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.
You can learn more about advertising serving companies and the options available to limit their
collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising
Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the webpages for Facebook’s ad preferences
tool and privacy policy. Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app
tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the
advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. For more information about how to change these
settings go to:
      Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228
      Android: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
      Windows: http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out
Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not
receive advertising while using our Sites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of
interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will,
however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks,
as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also
delete your opt-out preferences.
We use other websites analytics services, such as those provided by Google, Inc., to help us
administer and constantly improve the quality of our Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies or
other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Sites, and
provide us with services related to our Sites’ activity and usage. Google Analytics may collect
4849-0353-3933v.1 0059240-000010


information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any
referring website. That information will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be
subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn
how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google, click here.

OUR EMAIL POLICIES AND YOUR OPT-OUT OPTIONS

4849-0353-3933v.1 0059240-000010


        to products or services that are similar to those previously sold to you, and in such cases
        you will still be given the opportunity to opt-out of further marketing emails of that nature.
