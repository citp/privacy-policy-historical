### What does PrestoExperts do?

PrestoExperts provides an advisor platform that allows members to locate an advisor to ask questions or request advice and/or services directly from such advisor (the “Expert Platform”).  PrestoExperts, via the Expert Platform, enables a member to communicate directly with the advisor and pay for the services purchased by the member from such advisor.

### What information do we collect from you?

By visiting and/or communicating on the Expert Platform, we may collect certain information from you, including but not limited to:

  * Information you provide to us, such as: 
    * Personal information, such as your name and contact information.
    * Surveys, transcripts and recordings of your communications with advisors, members, and us.

    * Your payment information, including credit card number(s) and related billing information.

We collect information when you sign up to use the Expert Platform and also when you communicate with other members of the Expert Platform, including through:

  * PrestoExperts’s registration process
  * Chats
  * Phone calls
  * Messages
  * Message boards
  * If you register for the Expert Platform via a third-party social media platform, we may receive information from that third-party platform about you.
  * If you are referred to the Expert Platform through an affiliate or referral partner, we may receive information from such partners about you.
  * If you sign up as an Expert, although PrestoExperts is not responsible for vetting Experts, we may use a third party to confirm your credentials, including relevant licenses and certifications.



Please note that if we receive your information from third parties as mentioned above, the data you provide to such third parties is also subject to the third party’s privacy policy.

In addition, we may collect information through the following methods if you use the Expert Platform or visit Ksaamba’s social media pages or other pages located on third-party websites:

  * Your communications with PrestoExperts,
  * Your requests for information, news and other content,
  * A technical support request you submit, or
  * Your participation in a PrestoExperts promotion.



We may also collect information from our direct interactions with you, publicly available data or data provided by third-party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists.

### How does PrestoExperts use the information it collects about me?

We use the information we collect to provide and improve our services, to deliver information requested by you (for example in response to technical support requests), to deliver marketing or other materials to you (including through phone calls if you provide your telephone number), or for promotions you may enter into. We process your information if you have given your consent; if it’s necessary to perform a contract with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract; if it’s necessary to comply with legal obligations; or if it’s necessary for us or a third party to pursue a legitimate interest. PrestoExperts may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For example, PrestoExperts may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use the Services. We may also retain your information during the period of time needed for PrestoExperts to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Does PrestoExperts use cookies?

We may use cookies and other identification technologies for record keeping purposes and to enhance your experience on the Expert Platform. 

 **Cookies:**

Cookies are small text files stored on a visitor’s web browser and applications. Cookies are often used to make web-browsing easier by performing functions such as saving passwords and maintaining lists of personal preferences regarding the use of the website.

The Expert Platform may use the following types of cookies:

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies – these cookies are essential to enable you to browse the Expert Platform and use the available features.
  * Performance Cookies – these cookies collect information about how you use the Expert Platform. For instance, these cookies track which pages you visit most. This data may be used to help optimize the Expert Platform and make it easier for you to navigate within them. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you; all information is aggregated and anonymous.
  * Functionality Cookies – these cookies allow the Expert Platform to remember choices you make while browsing, such as geographic location and preferences such as text size and fonts. The information collected by these cookies will not personally identify you.



 **Other identification technologies that may be used by the Expert Platform:**

  * Pixel tags (also called beacons or pixels) – these are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage or application, which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address and other similar information.
  * Software Development Kits (also called SDKs) - function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile application context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The application developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) into the application to collect certain information about user interaction with the application and information about the user device and network information.



 **Third-party technologies:**

PrestoExperts may use third-party service providers or work with affiliate or referral partners who are authorized to place cookies, pixel tags or similar technologies on the Expert Platform with our permission.  These technologies help us compile metrics and analytics (without collecting personally identifiable information) to help improve the Expert Platform.  Third-party cookies and technologies are covered by the third party’s privacy policy. 

 **Your choice:**

Web browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you typically have the option of setting your browser to refuse cookies. If your browser is set to refuse cookies, it is likely that some of the functionality offered by PrestoExperts will not be available or will not work as effectively for you. 

For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, you can visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

 **Do Not Track**

Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari, currently offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology that sends a signal to websites a user visits about that user’s browser DNT preferences. While PrestoExperts attempts to honor the DNT instructions received from a user’s browser, PrestoExperts cannot guarantee that it will always respond to such signals because a common industry standard for DNT has not been adopted. PrestoExperts will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology.

### Sharing of information collected

PrestoExperts does not sell, trade or rent personal information provided by you in any transcript, survey or recording for direct marketing or any other purpose, except as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission. PrestoExperts does not disclose the contents of transcripts, surveys or recordings other than to service providers performing services on behalf of PrestoExperts, other than as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.

For legal reasons

We may share your information if we reasonably believe that it:  (i) is necessary to comply with a legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, or search warrant) or other legal requirement of any governmental authority; (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iii) is necessary to enforce this privacy policy or our Terms of Use at www.liveperson.com/policies/terms-of-use or any other agreement in place between you and PrestoExperts; (iv) is necessary to investigate and prevent unauthorized transactions or other illegal activities; and/or (v) is otherwise necessary or appropriate to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of any person or entity.

PrestoExperts may also disclose your personal information to any third party with your prior consent.

### Third-party integrations

From time to time, we may partner with other companies to allow PrestoExperts and its customers to offer integrations with the Expert Platform.  If you use one of these integrations, PrestoExperts may share your data with the third-party partner, receive data about you from the third-party partner, and/or combine third-party partner data about you with information about you that we collect.  We do not control how a third-party partner may use your data.   Use of your information by the third-party partner there is governed by its privacy policies.  If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this way, you may opt not to use such integrations.

### How can I review, correct, delete, transfer, or receive a copy of my information or withdraw my consent to process my personal data?

If you elect to engage in any communication session on the Expert Platform, it is up to you to decide what, if any, information to provide during such session.  Depending on your request, it may not be possible for us or Experts to fully provide all requested services to you.  Nevertheless, if you do not wish to provide certain information, then you should not do so.

### How does PrestoExperts keep my information secure?

We use security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, although data transmissions over the internet cannot be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.  Your personally identifiable information is encrypted during transmission.  In addition, transcripts that we store are maintained and archived on secure, hardened servers that are hosted on highly secure data centers.  Access to this data is protected by multiple layers of controls, including firewalls, role-based access controls, authentication mechanisms and monitoring.  Data is backed up, and archives are stored off-site in a secure location. You may review your chat history and see transcripts of chats you have engaged in.  You are only granted access to the chats you engaged in under your profile.
