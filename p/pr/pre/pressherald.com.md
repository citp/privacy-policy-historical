**The basic principle**  
In general, we will never intentionally disclose your personal information to any third party for their use without first receiving your express permission. We will not send you e-mail unless you have requested it or unless it's in the course of a transaction you have initiated.

**Free to use**  
You can access our Web sites and use many of our services free of charge, but we require you to submit personal information before accessing them.

The people who make it possible for us to provide free content to you are our advertisers. To enable advertisers to invest their media dollars appropriately, we target advertising through cookies (described below) and provide advertisers with a general summary about the demographics of our readership and usage of our sites. We never tell our advertisers your identity unless you expressly give us permission to do so.

**When do we collect your personal information?**  
You must provide personal information in order to use most features of our Web sites, through a standard registration form. You also may need to submit information to enter contests or sweepstakes, or to make purchases on the site, such as print or online classified advertising or newspaper subscriptions.

**What information do we collect?**  
The information we collect can include your name, address, zip code, gender, user name, password, e-mail address, birth date, household income, education level and phone number. We also collect credit card information for purchases. Wherever we collect personal information, we will make an effort to link to our privacy statement.

**How do we use your personal information?**  
We do not share or provide personal information we may collect, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers with our advertisers without your express permission.

Some of our online sweepstakes or contests may be sponsored by advertisers. In these cases we will clearly state that by participating in the contest or sweepstakes your entry information is shared with advertisers. If you do not wish to have your information shared, do not enter the contest.

We will not send you e-mail unless you have requested it or unless it's in the course of a transaction you have initiated. By registering, you agree to receive one email per month updating users on MaineToday.com site features and other relevant information. This will be titled "MaineToday.com update."

**How do we use site usage statistics?**  
Blethen Maine Newspapers collects some information automatically via server logs and cookies. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring URLs. We use this information to prepare for peak usage times and ensure a fast-loading site, to help diagnose problems with our server and to understand which features of our site are being used and when.

**How do we use cookies?**  
A cookie is a small file that stores information in your browser on your computer.   
Cookies are necessary for you to use Blethen Maine Newspapers Web sites, since the cookie on your computer identifies you as a registered user of our Web sites. 

The cookies we place in your browser contain some of the information you provide when you register with us. Those cookies can only be read by Blethen Maine Newspapers' systems, and only when you request Blethen Maine Newspapers Web pages. We do not store highly sensitive personal information such as your password, e-mail address or credit card in cookies.

We use cookies to provide personalized services such as saving your favorite automobile ads in our Wheels classifieds. We also use cookies to provide a more useful online experience - such as allowing you to quickly enter a sweepstakes if you're already logged on. And it can allow us to limit users to only one entry for an online poll.

Cookies enable us to summarize overall usage patterns for our analysis. Blethen Maine Newspapers never tracks your path when you leave a Blethen Maine Newspapers Web site.

We require written parental consent for children under 13 to register or submit personal information on our sites.
