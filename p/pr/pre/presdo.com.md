#### 3\. Uses the of Collected Information

Presdo uses the information collected from you to:

  * authenticate your visits;
  * conduct research;
  * provide anonymous reporting for internal and external entities.



Presdo uses the collected information to manage and improve our Site. Presdo collects this information so that Presdo can provide you the Site and offer personalized features.

When you update information, Presdo usually keeps a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. Presdo logs various types of information to help manage and improve the Site, in general and for you in particular. For example, Presdo identify items such as domains and browser types to understand how the Site is used and to report these statistics in the aggregate to the vendors that manage the technology of the Site.

Presdo may enhance or merge Personally Identifiable Information with your other information and with data from third parties in order to better develop, market and provide our products, services and software, including under the following circumstances:

  * technology and other service providers to provide technology and services to Presdo and to you;
  * vendors that help Presdo with data analysis, for example for product efficacy studies and market analysis.



The above third parties are all contractually obligated to keep the information Presdo provides confidential and to not use the information for any purpose other than providing services to Presdo and to you under Presdo’s direction. On occasion, Presdo may also receive your Personally Identifiable Information from these third parties.

Presdo limits access to personal information about users to employees who Presdo appropriately believes need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to users or in order to do their jobs.

Presdo shall also disclose Personally Identifiable Information as permitted or required by law or as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process. Presdo also shares information that it believes is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Presdo’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

As Presdo’s business evolves, Presdo may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including information provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of some or all of our assets or in the event of bankruptcy. In any such event, Personally Identifiable Information and other information may be one of the assets transferred. Presdo will post notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy, and Presdo will seek your consent if that policy is materially different from this one.
