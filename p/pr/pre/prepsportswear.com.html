                                marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings

                                As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries,
                                or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of
                                the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
                                pre-existing Privacy Policy. If Prep Sportswear, or substantially all of its assets
                                are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

                                that may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, if you have purchased
