                  with the <acronym title="President's Volunteer Service Award">PVSA</acronym> WEB SITE's website (the "website"),

				The website's registration, online surveys, contest and product
                order forms may ask users to provide personally identifiable
                information in one of three ways: through contact information
                (including, without limitation, name, address, phone number (home,
                work and/or cell), fax number and e-mail address), demographic
                information (including, without limitation, race, gender, ethnicity,
                and age) and, in some cases, financial information (including,
                without limitation, organizational income (when on behalf of
                an organization) and credit card number (when on behalf of an
                individual)). Some information will be required for you to avail
                yourself of that particular feature of the website. None of this
                personally identifiable information will be shared with third
                parties or used to market third party products or services; it
                will only be used as described below. </p>
                <p><br>
                From time to time, we may use the standard "cookie" feature
                of major browser applications that allows us to store data about
                your visit. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are
                useful and which areas need improvement. We do not set any personally
                identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data
                capture mechanisms on our website other than cookies. You may
                configure your web browser to prevent cookies from being set
                on your computer. </p>
                <p><br>
                The <acronym title="President's Volunteer Service Award">PVSA</acronym> WEB SITE may also gather anonymous, or aggregate,
                information, which may be used by us or shared with third
                parties. This is
                information which does not personally identify you, but which
                may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services
                we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic
                data" and may entail the use of numeric codes used to identify
                a computer. </p>

                  We use personally identifiable information from our online

                  We may use cookies to save your password so you don't have

                  will have the option to add additional personal information that is beyond
                  the information gathered at registration. Any information
                  you choose to share when using any of these forums or functions
                  becomes public information. It is incumbent upon you to
