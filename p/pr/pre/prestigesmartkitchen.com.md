# Privacy Policy : Prestige TTK

We respect your privacy.

At TTK Prestige, we are committed to protecting the privacy of all our customers. TTK Prestige does not sell, rent, or loan any identifiable information at the individual level regarding its customers to any third party. Any information you give us is held with utmost care and security. This information is collected primarily to ensure that we are able to fulfill your orders and to deliver to you a truly personalized shopping experience.

When you purchase products from TTK Prestige or register with us for any services, you have the option of receiving e-mails regarding updates about special offers, new products, and new services including any significant upgrades from TTK Prestige or from our marketing partners. In time, we will allow you to choose exactly the kind of information you wish to receive from us.

We are also bound to cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer. We may share non-personal, non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with our marketing partners, advertisers or other third-parties for research and advertising purposes. In other words, we will not tell our marketing partners that you purchased a specific product, but we may tell them how many customers purchased that product.
