You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information in such cases and acknowledge that such information may be retained by the third party even if you delete your Pretio Interactive account.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Pretio Interactive, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pretio Interactive goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pretio Interactive may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p>Protection of Pretio Interactive and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Pretio Interactive, our employees, our users, or others.
