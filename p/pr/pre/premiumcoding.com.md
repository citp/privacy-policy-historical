#### WEBSITE USE INFORMATION

Similar to other commercial websites, this site utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and Web server logs to collect information about how this site is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at this site, and the websites visited just before and just after our site. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small technology or pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.

We also collect theme usage data through our automatic update mechanism, which checks to insure you have the latest version of the theme you’ve purchased. This process is necessary in order to provide you with a painless and consistent upgrade experience. You can opt out of receiving automatic updates to the latest version of your theme by disabling updates in your Theme Settings.

#### WHAT ARE COOKIES?

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no access or control over those cookies.

#### HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM COOKIES?

As you use this website, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting this site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve this site and better serve our customers.

We have prepared a list of all cookies that are used on PremiumCoding.com site and option where you can withdraw your consent. Check [cookie list](https://premiumcoding.com/cookies-used-on-premiumcoding-com/).
