PRODUCT USER PRIVACY POLICY**

This Product User Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which Praendex Incorporated, doing business as PI Worldwide (“PI Worldwide” or “we”), handles personal information collected in connection with the administration of its Predictive Index® proprietary management tool (the “Predictive Index” or “PI”), the Selling Skills Assessment Tool™ (the “SSAT”) and related management and sales training and access to its e-learning system. This includes personal information collected by the administration of The Predictive Index Organization Survey Checklist (“PI Survey”) or the SSAT (via web application, a local desktop application, or paper form), or usage of our e-learning system. In this Policy, the term ‘personal information’ means information that identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual.

This Policy does not describe PI Worldwide’s information collection practices with respect to its general corporate websites located at piworldwide.com and ssatsurvey.com. In this Policy, the term “Customer” means PI Worldwide’s corporate customers; the term “User” means employees, prospective employees and contractors of Customers, and those individuals who have access to our e-learning system, including but not limited to Licensees, Consultants, Analysts, Clients, and potential Clients.

Background  


PI Worldwide and its distributors provide Predictive Index-related services to Customers to help them align individual performance with specific business goals. The Predictive Index process is a combination of assessment, education and consulting. At the core of that process is the PI Survey, an assessment tool that provides insight into the natural workplace behaviors of employees and prospective employees, giving management valuable insights for coaching, leadership development, succession planning, employee selection, team performance and more. Normally, Customers administer the PI Survey to their Users. Users generally take the PI Survey online, via the _access_ PI™ web application, although Users may also take the PI Survey through a local desktop application, or by completing printed versions of the PI Survey. The educational component of the Predictive Index process involves training conducted by PI Worldwide and its distributors. Upon completion of the Predictive Index Management Workshop™ trainees (hereinafter “PI Analysts”) have received the necessary training to interpret and apply the Predictive Index. Whether the PI Survey is completed through the _access_ PI web application, a local desktop application or on paper, PI Worldwide’s software provides Customers with the results of the PI Survey, along with a basic report, which needs to be interpreted by a trained PI Analyst. In addition, PI Worldwide directly and through its distributors, provides consulting services to Customers to allow them to maximize the usefulness of the Predictive Index process.

PI Worldwide and its distributors also provide its Selling Skills Assessment Tool (SSAT) to Customers. The SSAT, available in over 20 industry- or job-specific editions, is an online survey of 25 targeted, scenario-based questions, which provides management with a detailed quantification of the selling skills possessed across their organization. The results provide Customers with sales force data, group data and individual data. Users have access to their own SSAT results and to a general comparative analysis of the SSAT results of the group of Customer employees in which they fall; Users do not have direct access to the SSAT results of any other User. In addition, PI Worldwide directly and through its distributors, provides sales training services to Customers to allow them to focus their sales training initiative for maximum impact. PI Worldwide also provides access to its e-learning system through a third-party server which provides information about the Predictive Index as well as questions at the end of each Module for the User to provide answers to various questions in order to assess his/understanding of the content.

PI Worldwide and its distributors also provide e-learning modules to Licensees, Associates, Analysts, Clients and potential Clients. The purpose of the e-learning system is to provide learning modules about the Predictive Index and the history of behavioral analytics, interpretation of the Survey and how to provide meaningful and appropriate feedback to those who take the Predictive Index Survey.

Safe Harbor  


PI Worldwide complies with the U.S.- EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  PI Worldwide has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view PI Worldwide’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>
