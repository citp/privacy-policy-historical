This information includes information concerning the software running on and internet connectivity of the user's computer, such as data about programs scanned, website URLs checked, and threats and attempted intrusion events detected. This has been designed with data protection in mind, and so does not collect any personally identifying or transaction related information. If Prevx links any Product Collected Data to your personal name we will treat it as Personal Data. Please note, we don't upload any of your data files and software programs on your computer without your consent; our software creates a special cryptographically secure hash value from the file or program being inspected and compares this value with our online database to verify whether the program or file is a known good or bad program or file within our anti-malware database; but we may ask you to upload a suspicious file or program we have not identified before for analysis.

  2. **How we collect it**

The Product Collected Data is collected automatically by the Prevx software, for instance when it runs a scan on your computer or you visit a web-page.

  3. **What we use it for**
    1. **Provide Product**

We use such Product Collected Data to provide our Product to you. Our Product sends to our remote servers and databases (where it is retained) details of the files and software on your computer for purposes of checking whether that file or software is known or suspected malware against our database, and examining that software where it is suspected, and keeping a record of the status of your computer so as to identify any new previously unseen software that tries to run. Our Product also sends details of visited website URLs to our database to verify the legitimacy of the URLs.

    2. **Improve our Database**

We also use the software, URL and threat information we obtain from your computer to improve the performance of our databases and systems, to provide additional statistical information which is used in the verification of software, files and websites. The Product Collected Data is aggregated into our community database and used to make determinations on good and bad programs.

    3. **Statistics**

We use the Product Collected Data to produce general statistics on attacks, threats, their propagation and overall measures of the level of internet abuse and crime. These statistics may be used by us in our malware research, publicity, marketing and promotional materials. We use the Product Collected Data for analyzing and publishing overall threat activity on the internet, researching threats, compiling statistics and to further refine and improve the performance of the Prevx Products.

    4. **Analysis**

We may also use the Product Collected Data to carry out analysis and research in relation to our overall Product performance and in relation malware and dangerous websites, and to facilitate reviews, developments and improvements of our Products.

Their use is very common by many online services. They enable us to know you by a computer-generated, unique identifier, and are used to store and track information about Website usage and to remember you and your settings when you next visit.
