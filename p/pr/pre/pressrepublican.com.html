      <p>Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., the parent company of Ottaway Newspaper
      Group, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as
      "Ottaway", "we", "us" or "our", as
      applicable) are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal
      information that you provide to us when using their respective web sites
      (the "Ottaway Web Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes how we
      treat personal information received about you when you visit the Ottaway
      Web Sites.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Information Collected</p>
      </u>
      </b><p><b>Web Site Usage Information</b>: We automatically collects IP addresses
      and web site usage information from you when you visit the Ottaway Web
      Sites. This information helps us in evaluating how our visitors use and
      navigate the Ottaway Web Sites on an aggregate basis, including the number
      and frequency of visitors to each page of the Ottaway Web Sites, and the
      length of their visits.</p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b>Special Features</b>: When you use some of the special features of the
      Ottaway Web Sites and at other times, we may collect personally
      identifiable information from you that may include your name, age,
      address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your interests
      and similar information.</p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b>Surveys and Form</b>: We may conduct occasional online surveys or ask
      you to fill in forms. For example, when you are within the Ottaway Web
      Sites, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity
      of participating in a survey. These surveys and forms are entirely
      voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.</p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b>Children: </b>We do not knowingly collect information from children
      under the age of 13 although certain third party sites that we link to may
      do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and privacy
      policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
      children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by
      instructing their children to never provide information on the Ottaway Web
      Sites without their permission.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>How We Use Information Collected
      </p>
      </u></b>
      <p>We may use information that you provide us in the following ways:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>For the purposes for which you specifically provided the
          information, for example, when you request that additional information
          be sent to you, we will use your personal information to process your
          request.</li>
            <li>To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing
          services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.</li>
            <li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and
          others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.</li>
            <li>To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and
          services.</li>
            <li>To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate
          information about our user base and usage patterns.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We may combine the information that we collect from you on the Ottaway
      Web Sites with information that you provide to us in connection with your
      use of our other products, services and web sites.</p>
      <p>We use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our
      behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on
      our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our services or fulfill your
      requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied
      with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for
      the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.</p>
      <p>We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special
      circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use (for
      example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights) or
      when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate,
      in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the
      Ottaway Web Sites. We may also disclose personally identifiable
      information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do
      so. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.
      In transactions such as these, customer information is generally one of
      the transferred business assets. Moreover, in the unlikely event that we
      or one of our publishing lines are acquired, customer information may be
      one of the transferred assets.</p>
      <p>Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share
      your personally identifiable information outside of Ottaway unless you
      "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information
      shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Your Ability to Choose</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>You can always decide not to provide your personal information to the
      Ottaway Web Sites, however in some cases failing to provide such
      information may limit your ability to use certain or features available at
      the Ottaway Web Sites. You can let us know that you do not wish to receive
      information about special offers and new products and features by opting
      out at the time you give us your personally identifiable information or
      after opting in by contacting us at the following e-mail address: <a href="mailto:rblack@pressrepublican.com">rblack@pressrepublican.com</a>.</p>
      <b><u>
      </u></b><p><b><u>Cookies</u></b></p>
      <p>We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site, to
      recognize repeat visitors and to allow you to take advantage of some of
      our site’s special features. A cookie is a string of information that is
      sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your
      computer’s memory. Cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes)
      and should not pose any significant disk-space concerns. When you visit
      the Ottaway Web Sites, or use some of the features, like saving your
      personalized Ottaway Web Sites settings, we may pass cookies to your
      computer. Some of the cookies that we pass to your computer are long term.
      Otherwise, we would need to ask you for certain information with each new
      session, such as your login information. Some cookies do expire after a
      short period of time.</p>
      <p>Other cookies that you will receive during your sessions here are from
      third-party service providers or third party network advertisers. These
      network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on the
      Ottaway Web Sites, ensuring that you will not see the same ads over and
      over again. We are not responsible for the cookies of such third parties
      or any use of your personal information collected by such third parties.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Ottaway Web Sites Ads</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>When you view an ad for the Ottaway Web Sites on other sites, our third
      party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your
      browser. The Ottaway Web Sites and the advertising company may also use
      invisible images (often referred to as pixel tags, clear GIFs or web
      beacons) to note which Ottaway Web Sites pages you visit after viewing our
      ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is
      not personally identifiable and is used only to track responses to our
      advertising efforts.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Links to Third Party Web Sites</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>We may make third party content or services from other web sites
      available to you from links located on the Ottaway Web Sites. These other
      web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you
      review the terms of use and privacy policy at each such web site to
      determine how that site protects your privacy. We are not responsible for
      the content of those web sites or the actions of third party web site
      operators.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Security</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored
      in limited access servers. We will maintain reasonable safeguards to
      protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable
      information.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Review and Correction</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>You can also request to review, change or delete any of your personally
      identifiable information held by us by contacting us at the following
      e-mail address: <a href="mailto:rblack@pressrepublican.com">rblack@pressrepublican.com</a>.</p>
      <b><u>
      </u></b><p><b><u>Exclusions</u></b></p>
      <p>Any submissions that you make to any public areas of the Ottaway Web
      Sites including but not limited to, chat services, bulletin boards,
      reviews, letters to the editor (collectively "Public Areas")
      will be public and will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. We do not
      control, and are not responsible for, the actions of other users of the
      Ottaway Web Sites with respect to any information you post in Public
      Areas. In addition, information that you submit to Public Areas may be
      collected and used by us and by others to send you unsolicited messages
      and for other purposes.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Policy Modifications</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any
      changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.</p>
