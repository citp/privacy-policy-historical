Updated July 22, 2013

**Online Privacy Policy**

Welcome! This Online Privacy Policy applies to your use of websites, interactive services and mobile device applications provided by Diamond Comic Distributors and its affiliates (collectively, Diamond, we or us) and that display an authorized link to this policy (collectively, the Services). This Online Privacy Policy applies only to the information we collect online through the Services. By using any of our Services, you agree that this Online Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/TermsOfUse) govern your use of our Services and any dispute concerning the Services. Please take a few minutes to read them before using or registering to access our Services. 

If you have questions about this Online Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@diamondcomics.com](mailto:privacy@diamondcomics.com)

**Information We Collect**   
At some of our sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.  Please click [here](https://web.archive.org/Home/TermsOfUse) to view our Terms and Conditions, including information regarding your use of these features.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

You may be required to provide us with the requested personally identifiable information to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings. 

**How We Use Personally Identifiable Information**  
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may share your information with our affiliated companies.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. 

The information we may collect in connection with online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience.  We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 

**Mailing Lists**  
We may launch a mailing list for some or all of the Services and websites, in order to provide subscribers with relevant information: breaking news, or weekly or daily round-ups, for example. In order to sign up to receive regular e-newsletters from a site's mailing list, users must submit information including a valid e-mail address and demographic information such as location and interests. Demographic information will be used in aggregate form only in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products and services. 

Users who choose to sign up for a mailing list will receive regular e-mails from the site. Most of the time, these will be content from the site in question, but we may periodically send out an e-mail from a third party sponsor. Such e-mails do not represent an endorsement by Diamond of any products, services or information advertised therein. Such e-mails will clearly be marked as advertising: please check it out, as we hope you will feel that it is relevant to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mails from third party advertisers, please do not sign up for the mailing list. 

**Discussion Group and Cookies**  
In order to further enhance the user experience; Diamond runs a commenting service on some or all of the Diamond Sites where users can discuss common topics of interest. Users have the option of signing up for this service, and to do so must submit information including a valid e-mail address. Diamond uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use and to pick out topics of interest to discussion board users Diamond will not pass this information to any other organization except in aggregate form. 

Some services Diamond offers may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user(s) hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

By setting a cookie on a Diamond Comic site, users will not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the site(s) discussion board. We store a cookie on each user's machine that contains a username and encrypted password. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Diamond products or services that require you to "sign in" and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, not all Diamond services require that you accept cookies. 

**Third Party Cookies**  
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, Diamond has no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Diamond only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

******Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information.**  
Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, information about your wireless carrier, the make, model and operating system of your device and information about how you navigate within our Service. With your consent, we also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or WiFi triangulation to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. We use this information to provide you the content and services you request, tell you about offers we think you will value, and improve your experience using our mobile applications and other Services.

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

We protect the security of the credit card information you provide online by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input into our shopping cart during transmission to our servers and is stored in secure locations.  We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order placed online.  Of course, we do transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
