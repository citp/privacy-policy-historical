Orders shall be accepted at our sole discretion but are normally accepted if the item(s) is/are available, the order reflects current pricing, you are based in a country to which we are currently able to sell/deliver and your credit/debit card is authorised for the transaction.</p>
			<p>4.5	In the event that an item is out of stock, you will be informed as soon as practically possible once we are made aware by our suppliers. The order relating to the unavailable item will be cancelled and a full refund will be made including any delivery charges. Where your order is for multiple items, the rest of the order will remain valid.</p>

			<h2>5. Pricing and Payment</h2>

Payment by card will be processed through the electronic payment terminal of HSBC.

The User's payment details are transferred directly to the bank, which also operates under the secure SSL encryption.</p>
			<p>5.4	In the event that payment cannot be made in accordance with section 5.3, the order will not be processed and will automatically be cancelled. If you have already received any items, you must return those items to us in the same condition that you received them at your own expense.  If you fail to do so within 7 days of our cancelling your order, we may arrange for collection of the items at your expense.  We reserve the right to charge you for any damage to (or other adverse interference with) any items that are the subject of an order that we cancel in accordance with this section.</p>

			<h2>6. Acceptance of your order</h2>
			<p>6.1	Your offer to purchase an item is accepted by us and a contract of sale between us is formed only on the later of: (a) the receipt by us of cleared funds from you in full payment for the item(s) (including any applicable taxes and delivery costs); and (b) our written confirmation of your order (whether by a dispatch confirmation email or otherwise).</p>
			<p>6.2	Once the payment has been accepted, the order cannot be amended.</p>

                        <p>7.4   All risk in the items you order (including risk of loss and/or damage to the items) shall pass to you when they are delivered to the delivery address specified in your order.</p>
                        <p>7.5   You will only own the items once they have been successfully delivered and when we have received cleared payment for them in full. Until that time we will retain title to the items.</p>

			<h2>8. Failed Delivery</h2>
			<p>8.1	If you are not present at the time of delivery, a delivery note will be left inviting you to contact the courier directly in order to arrange re-delivery at a convenient time. If you are not in when a second delivery attempt is made, another note will be left asking you to call to arrange a convenient time for delivery. If you are not in when a third attempt is made, the parcel will be returned to the courier's warehouse and you will be contacted. We will refund you for the value of the items ordered but not for the delivery charge.</p>
