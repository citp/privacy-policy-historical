You can visit and browse the Website without disclosing any information about yourself.  However, to participate in any Services (i.e., to submit postings in connection with various features of the Website, including blog posts, and articles, and to register to receive newsletters and fight alerts), you must register and provide accurate information about yourself to the Website.  

This Website contains links to websites that are not operated by Haymon.  These third parties may collect data from you and share some of that data with us or others.  Haymon is careful when choosing its partners, sponsors, and affiliates, but Haymon is not responsible for any misuse of personal information by such third parties.  We recommend that you view the privacy policy posted on each website that you use to confirm that the site’s policies are acceptable to you. 

Any Personal Information you provide to the Website is protected from unauthorized disclosure by commercially reasonable technological measures.  While Haymon strives to protect your personal information by encryption and other means, Haymon cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you transmit to us, and if you choose to use the Website, Services, and/or Content, you do so at your own risk.  There may be additional security risks if you provide your Personal Information over a public or third-party network.  Please keep in mind that the information disclosed by you on the Website—for example, information you may provide to others in responding to blog posts, articles, and the like that may be available on the Website—may be collected and used by visitors to the Website.
