This Privacy Policy states the National Trust's policy with regard to the personal information you provide.&nbsp; The National Trust is committed to honoring the privacy preferences of members of the public that visit our web sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our intention through these web sites is to supply information that will help people save historic places and build better communities. In the course of providing these online services, information may be exchanged between the National Trust, servers, online users and their browsers.

<h3><a name="personal"></a>PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
<p>Personal Information Collected&nbsp; -&nbsp; The National Trust has a strong commitment to internet privacy.&nbsp; We provide choices to the consumer in deciding when and how to provide different categories of "personally identifiable information" (e.g., data that may be used to identify, contact or locate a person such as name, physical address, e-mail address and phone number and information you provide to help customize your web experience.)&nbsp; In general, when you visit our main web sites and access information we do not require you to register or provide personal information to us. However, there are occasions when we will ask for additional information.&nbsp; For example, you may be required to register your name and e-mail address or other necessary information in order to enter certain member-only areas of the web sites such as for Forum or Main Street members.&nbsp; You may also be required to register your name and e-mail address if you wish to receive e-newsletters, participate in special initiatives or in surveys or contests.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may opt out from receiving any of this type of information in the future.&nbsp; Personally identifiable information, such as your name, physical address, e-mail address, phone number and credit card information will be collected if you wish to become a member of the National Trust online, make purchases online, or make online donations.&nbsp; Please be advised we will never share your credit card information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor will we ever share your email address unless otherwise authorized by you.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<p><strong>Internet Protocol</strong></p>
<p>We may keep track of your interactions with our sites and our services to offer a more personalized experience through the use of Cookies or through your Internet Protocol address.<br><br>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is associated with the portal through which you enter the internet, like your internet service provider (ISP).&nbsp; Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.&nbsp; At times, we use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts of our sites.&nbsp; We may also combine this information with personally identifiable information, e.g., your name and address that you have provided to us and/or with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other reputable sources in order to make our web site and communications more targeted to your interests. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Our web sites also use "Cookies."&nbsp; "Cookies" are small files sent from a Web server to your computer through your browser program that permit the computer to help customize your experience with our web sites. The National Trust uses cookies to measure visitation to the National Trust sites, including repeat visitors, and to perform certain functions such as order processing and registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies may be used to store some history about the parts of our web sites that you have visited to help you navigate our web site more easily or to alert you to related pages on our web sites that may interest you.&nbsp; The National Trust does not use cookies to obtain information about other web sites that you may have visited.&nbsp; For more information about cookies, visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">http://www.cookiecentral.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Invite-A-Friend and e-Cards</strong></p>
<p>If a user elects to use our Invite-A-Friend referral service for informing a friend or colleague about our web site or for sending an e-Card, we ask for&nbsp;the friend's name and e-mail address.&nbsp; The National Trust will automatically send the friend a one-time message inviting them to visit a particular web page on the site.&nbsp; The National Trust uses the recipient's information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and the recipient information is not retained.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information Contained in User Content</strong></p>
<p>Some sections of our web site may allow users to post or transmit messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials.&nbsp; We encourage your thoughts, stories, photos, but be advised that any content you submit to the web sites will not be returned to you and may be used by us in any manner we see fit, including reprinting it in full or in modified version on the web sites or elsewhere or using elements of it on the web sites.&nbsp; You will not be entitled to any remuneration for any use of your content by us or our&nbsp;subsidiaries or historic sites.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for the contents of your transmission through the site.&nbsp; The National Trust does not monitor such transmissions, and therefore cannot be responsible for any personally identifiable information or other information that may be contained in such transmissions.&nbsp; You agree not to transmit through the Site any unlawful, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, or harmful material of any kind or nature.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><strong>Use of Membership Information</strong></p>
<p>On a selective basis, Members may be selected to receive&nbsp;information via postal mail from&nbsp;other non-profit organizations, including state and local preservation organizations&nbsp;and occasionally for-profit organizations that we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; You have the right to opt-out of these mailings. <br><br>Links to Third-Party Web Sites -&nbsp;&nbsp; We provide many links to third party web sites existing outside of the National Trust. Since we do not control the content or functionality of these web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third-party web sites. Any link from <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/">http://www.preservationnation.org/</a> to such a third-party web site does not denote an affiliation with the web site or an endorsement of its viewpoint(s) or mission(s).</p>
<p>Subsidiaries and National Trust Historic Sites&nbsp; -&nbsp; The National Trust has a number of subsidiaries and Historic Sites that offer a wide range of products and services.&nbsp; Unless you opt-out, we may share your postal address with&nbsp;the following&nbsp;Subsidiaries and Historic Sites to inform you of the various product and service offerings in which you might be interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidiaries and Historic Sites are subject to the same opt-out rights that apply to use of personally identifiable information by the National Trust.</p>

<h3><a name="security"></a>SECURITY OF YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</h3>
<p>All information provided to the National Trust is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption.&nbsp; SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.&nbsp; We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of the National Trust.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.&nbsp; While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.&nbsp; <br><br>If you do not wish to use our online payment services, payments may be made by contacting our 24-hour call center at 1-800-315-NTHP (6847).&nbsp; At this time all other online payment options (i.e. Preservation Books or the Main Street Store) can only be processed online.</p>
