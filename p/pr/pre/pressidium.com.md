# Privacy Policy - Pressidium® Managed WordPress Hosting

Like most website operators, TechIO Limited collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TechIO Limited’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pressidium® visitors use its website. From time to time, TechIO Limited may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

TechIO Limited also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Pressidium.com blogs. TechIO Limited only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally- identifying information as described below except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Pressidium® Pinnacle Platform websites choose to interact with TechIO Limited in ways that require TechIO Limited to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TechIO Limited gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at presidium.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with TechIO Limited are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, TechIO Limited collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with TechIO Limited. TechIO Limited does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website- related activities.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

TechIO Limited discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TechIO Limited’s behalf or to provide services available at TechIO Limited’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TechIO Limited’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TechIO Limited will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TechIO Limited discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when TechIO Limited believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TechIO Limited, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Pressidium® Pinnacle Platform website and have supplied your email address, TechIO Limited may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with TechIO Limited and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TechIO Limited takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TechIO Limited websites, with the drawback that certain features of TechIO Limited’s websites and the Pressidium® Pinnacle Platform may not function properly without the aid of cookies. To achieve meaningful insight we also use third-party vendors who place first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by TechIO Limited and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Comments and other content submitted to the Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, TechIO Limited may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TechIO Limited’s sole discretion. TechIO Limited encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Pressidium.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
