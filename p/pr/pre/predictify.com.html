 <h1>Predictify Privacy Policy</h1>
 
  <p>Predictify is committed to honoring the privacy of our users. Our privacy philosophy is based on a single core principle: we will not collect, use, or share any personally identifiable information about you without your knowledge. The following document outlines our privacy policy, which is incorporated by reference into our <a href="termsofuse.aspx">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
    
   <h3>When We Collect Information</h3>

    <h4>Site Visits</h4>

     <p>When you visit our site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. Cookies allow us to store user preferences and track trends in site usage in order to improve the quality of the user experience. Some Predictify features and services may not function properly when cookies are disabled.</p>
     <p>When you use Predictify services, our servers automatically record information provided by your browser. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies.</p>

    <h4>Account Creation</h4>
   
     <p>When you create an account, Predictify collects personal information, such as your name and email address, during the registration process. By default, this information will be displayed to other users who view your profile. You may choose to make private one or more of these fields by updating your preferences on your <a href="account.aspx">My Account</a> page.</p>

    <h4>Question Submission</h4>

     <p>To submit a <a href="help.aspx#deterministic">deterministic question</a>, you must log in to your account (you may not submit questions anonymously). All questions will be reviewed by Predictify prior to being posted and are subject to our <a href="questionguidelines.aspx">Question Guidelines</a>.</p>

    <h4>Prediction Submission</h4>
     
     <p>Submitting a prediction may require that you provide additional personal information that has been specifically requested by the Information Seeker, such as political affiliation or marital status. This information will be included in the question results but will not be linked to you or your account in a personally identifiable way. That is, question results may reflect that married respondents, in aggregate, predicted a different outcome than unmarried respondents, but not your specific response.</p>
     <p>Personal information submitted with predictions will be added to your profile, where you can view it, change it, and/or delete it. To ensure that the information is current, we may ask you to update it from time to time. You may request that certain personal information not be added to your profile by opting out on your <a href="account.aspx">My Account</a> page.</p>

    <h4>Billing and Payments</h4>

     <p>When you submit a Premium question, you are required to provide billing information, including a credit card number and billing address. When you withdraw payouts from Premium questions, you are required to provide payment information, including a mailing address (for payment by check) or a PayPal account number (for electronic payment). All financial information will be stored securely and will not be shared with any third party.</p>

    <h4>Communications</h4>

     <p>When you communicate with Predictify via email or phone, we may store copies of this correspondence for our records and to improve the quality of our services.</p>

   <h3>When We Use Information</h3>

    <h4>Question Results</h4>

     <p>Predictify aggregates user predictions into a distribution of beliefs about the likely outcome of an event. These predictions, combined with non-personal information about the predictors, are presented in aggregate to the Information Seeker. In the case of Premium questions, results are shared only with the Information Seeker. In the case of Free questions, results are posted for public viewing.</p>

    <h4>Internal Analysis</h4>

     <p>From time to time, Predictify may conduct an analysis of data stored on its servers for the purposes of improving existing services or developing new products. We restrict such access to employees, contractors, and agents who are bound by confidentiality obligations and subject to discipline for their violation.</p>
    
    <h4>When We Share Information</h4>

     <p>Predictify may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, such as the number of total site visits or the results of a question. However, Predictify will not share your personal information with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
     <p>1) With our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons under the condition that they comply with this privacy policy.</p>
     <p>2) When we have good faith reason to believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable <a href="termsofuse.aspx">Terms of Use</a>, including investigation of potential violations thereof, or (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p>
     <p>In the case of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or bankruptcy, Predictify will provide notice before personal information is transferred and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

    <h4>Data Security</h4>

     <p>Predictify has put in place reasonable physical and technological security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, and use of, data collected on our site and stored on our servers. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any information you transmit to Predictify, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
     <p>Our site is hosted on servers located in the United States and is subject U.S. laws and regulations.</p>

   <h3>Other Considerations</h3>

    <p>We may update this policy from time to time and post new versions on this page - please see the date of last revision to identify whether the policy has changed recently. In case of major revisions, we will prominently delineate those changes and post notification elsewhere on the site.</p>
    <p>For more information about Predictify or our privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@predictify">info@predictify.com</a>.</p>
