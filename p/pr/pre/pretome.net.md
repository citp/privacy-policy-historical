# Dove House - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Dove House. This statement describes our privacy practices for our website, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You can visit www.DoveHouse.us without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. However, access to certain portions of the website may require you to submit information such as user-id and password. If you wish for us to contact you, we will need some personal information such as your name, address, email and phone number.

To access our transaction programs, we may ask for your address and/or credit card information. When registering via the website, we may also ask you to choose a security question to answer. This required information is necessary for us to process the transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.

**INFORMATION SECURITY AND QUALITY**

We intend to protect the quality and integrity of any personally identifiable information you may provide. Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.
