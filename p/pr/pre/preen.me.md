# Privacy Policy | Preen.Me

**Privacy Policy**  
Preen.Me is a service operating across internet and various social media channels that lets users interact and upload various looks, adding and categorizing different products, allowing you to discover what looks and products other people are using and thinking about (the “Service”). The Service is provided by Crowdsmiths Inc. (“we” or “us”). This Privacy Policy gives you information about our practices with respect to personally identifiable information: information that could reasonably identify you and which we collect in connection with the Service  
I. Visibility   
The Service features looks mostly generated by other users and products from various brands. When using the Service, your actions and everything you choose and categorize will be visible to your social network and potentially to others using the Service. The Service typically enables you to buy products from third party sites. While using the Service, by default, your interactions with the Service will automatically be shared in the following ways:  
a) Within the Service, indications of all the looks and products you have categorized and commented on.  
b) In your social media accounts and profiles, your news feeds, profiles, and other information feeds may indicate you liked, shared, commented on, categorized, viewed, or purchased a look, product, video, or other content. This may be visible to your entire social media network, regardless of their use of the Service, depending on your privacy settings with respect to a given social media network.   
c) With the Service’s website and social media channels, there may be an indication you liked, shared, commented on, categorized, viewed, or purchased a look, product, video, or other content.  
The Service is intended for users to interact with one another, and share their thoughts, reviews, recommendations, product preferences, photos, videos, etc. regarding looks and products with other users. Provided that posted content is permitted under the Service’s Terms of Use, we do not generally restrict what you publish on the Service and/or share with other users while using the Service.   
You should be aware any information and/or content you publish on publicly-accessible areas of the Service may be viewed, downloaded, shared, and/or used by others. We are not responsible for any personal content you submit in these areas and you are solely responsible for protecting your privacy by choosing what you voluntarily and publicly share online.  
Because the Service operates across Facebook, Instagram, and other social media channels, information you provide to us or that we collect is also generally accessible through Facebook, Instagram, and other social media channels and therefore subject to their respective privacy policies. Those parties may collect information about you in connection with your use of the Service. Please note the Service has no control or influence on the privacy practices of third party providers.   
II. Collection of Information  
We may ask you to provide personally identifiable information for various reasons and at various times. For example, when you sign up for the Service, we may collect your email address, interests, and other information about those connected to your social media accounts. We may ask for information about users at other times, such as when they contact us with a question. We may combine this information with other information (including personally identifiable information) about users that we may have collected from other sources.  
We may automatically collect information about you when you use the Service. For instance, we may automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which products users interact with, how users categorize and rate products, which products users buy through the Service and from which third party sites, where users click on the website, information about specific interests and channels, the domain name, your IP address, Web browser, and referring web site. In addition, we may place a “cookie” (a small, unique identifier text file) on your system to remember who you are. We also may include other information in our cookie files; for example, if you arrived at this site via a link from third-party site, we may include the URL of the linking page. You may opt out of the cookies delivered by us by changing your browser settings. However, this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by us, and such blocking may you from accessing the Service. We may combine this information with other information, including personally identifiable information we have collected about you.  
Other than with respect to personally identifiable information, if you provide information to us, you agree we have unlimited rights to such information and we may use such information in any way we choose. Such information shall be deemed non-confidential.  
III. Use of Information  
We use information, including personally identifiable information we have collected about you, in several ways, including:  
a) To build your Service profile. This profile will be visible to other users and may display the name, photo, location, age, and any other profile information you provided to us through the Service or through connected social media channels.  
b) To manage and administer your account, including to process and fulfill the transactions you initiate, to identify you on the Service, to send you information related to the Service, to solicit or respond to your questions or comments, to inform you of material changes or additions to this Privacy Policy or the Terms or Use, or to contact you with legal notices.  
c) To send you offers and information from us and our affiliates or from other companies whose products and services you may be interested in. You may choose to opt-out and to not receive these communications, without also deactivating their account and ceasing use of the Service.  
d) To provide you with a more personalized experience by serving you more relevant content and advertising.  
e) To conduct research on our customers’ demographics, interests, and behavior, to analyze traffic patterns, general business analytics, and to create recommendations based on user preferences.  
f) To administer contests, promotions, surveys, or other site features.  
g) To help prevent fraudulent use of our services and ensuring the technical functioning of our network.  
h) In other ways as described to you at the point of collection or otherwise.  
If you choose to register or submit information to the Service, you agree to the use of such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  
IV. Sharing of Information  
We may share information, including personally identifiable information we collect about you, in limited circumstances including:  
a) With respect to the products you interact with, with your social media networks, and other users of the Service, as described above.  
b) With our corporate affiliates.  
c) With our partners, in aggregate form.  
d) With vendors providing contractual services to us (such as hosting vendors, list managers that facilitate or assist with communications on our behalf, companies that provide consulting or analytics services, or service providers that process payment information or transactions).  
e) When we have reason to believe disclosing such information may be necessary to identify, contact, or otherwise take legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property or any other third party who might be harmed by such activities; to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal proceedings; in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; and as we deem necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or otherwise comply with the requirements of the law.  
f) In the event our ownership changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or other corporate event.  
g) With a service provider with your permission (e.g., if you sign up as a lead).  
h) With selected third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  
I) With other entities for business analytics.  
J) In additional ways as may be described to you at the point of collection.

VII. External Links  
Many elements of the Service link to third party websites. Those websites do not adhere to this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, disclosing, and protecting personal information.  
VIII. Persons under Age 13  
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. Please do not send any information about yourself to us if you are under the age of 13\.
