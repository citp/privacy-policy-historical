# Preferred Hotel Group - Privacy Policy

Preferred Hotel Group is committed to providing exceptional service to all of our customers. We believe that we can engage in more relevant communications with you through the intelligent use of information. We understand that you may have questions about the collection and use of information about you. Accordingly, we have prepared this statement to inform you of our Privacy Policy.

We adhere to the following policies when handling personal or business information you share with us:

Principle 1: We collect general information like names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers, along with more specific information like travel behavior and lifestyle from various sources. These sources include, but are not limited to: business reply cards that are bound into various trade publications, marketing partner data forms that are distributed at the front desk at all Preferred properties and the Preferred Web site. We do this for the purpose of rewarding mileage credit and points for marketing programs as well as to inform you about special promotions that run throughout the year. We may enhance this information with data from outside sources to facilitate more relevant, targeted communications as well as develop products and services that better suit our customers' needs. We also collect information about the behavior of visitors to our Web site for overall analysis and more targeted communications.

Principle 2: We will use this information for Preferred Hotel Group business purposes only. We will not disclose or sell any customer's information to any external organizations. We may however, work with our partners and use this information to introduce you to, on behalf of Preferred Hotel Group, additional value-added services we feel may be of interest.

Principle 3: We may use mailing address information to send direct mail promotions to your home. We may also use e-mail addresses (when submitted to us by you) to mail you information about special offers or promotions.

Principle 4: All information, including credit card information that you provide to us over the Internet during the reservation process is encrypted for your protection. This encryption is designed to help prevent any unauthorized person from intercepting or reading any application information you send us.

At any time, whether you receive e-mail or direct mail, you may ask us to discontinue use of the information you have provided and request that we refrain from sending any further communications.

You may call us at +800.237.7254, ext. 1020. Please give us your name and address and specify which promotion you received and how (i.e. mail or e-mail), and we will proceed to remove your name and address from all further communications.
