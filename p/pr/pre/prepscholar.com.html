        protecting the privacy of all individuals who utilize our site or services. Please read the
        following to understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information we may obtain via
        this website (the "Site"). This statement may be revised from time to time, so please
        revisit this page often to remain fully informed of our statement.</p>
      <h2>What information does PrepScholar collect from you?</h2>
      <p>Via the Site, PrepScholar collects: (i) personally identifiable information, and (ii)
        technical and other information.</p>

      <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p><strong><em>Children</em></strong> — In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy
        Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§501-06 and 16 C.F.R. §§ 312.1-312.12, PrepScholar does not
        permit children under 13 years of age to become users without their parent or guardian’s
        express consent and approval. By using our Site, you represent (i) you are not under 13
        years of age or (ii) your parent or guardian has registered with PrepScholar on your behalf
        via our Precocious Program and has provided us his or her personal information in lieu of
        yours. As used herein, “you” refers to all Site users over the age of 13, and the
        parent/guardian of users under 13 years of age who have registered with PrepScholar via our
        Precocious Program, as applicable.</p>
      <p><strong><em>General Site Visitors</em></strong> — When you browse the general, non-password
        protected portions of the Site, you do so anonymously; no personally identifiable
        information is collected.</p>

        mailing address, user name and password. In addition, by registering as a general
        subscriber, you have automatically opted-in to receive further information regarding our

      <p><strong><em>Paying Subscribers</em></strong> — In addition, if you register as a paying
        subscriber of the Site to obtain access to our specialized services, we require you to

        applying for financial assistance, we will collect certain other information regarding your
        family's financial status. Finally, you may let other individuals know about us through our
        referral feature, or allow other individuals to monitor your account, in which case we will
        ask you to provide us such individual's name and email address.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Newsletter</em></strong> — When you register as a general subscriber or paying
        subscriber of PrepScholar, you are automatically subscribed (at no charge) to our
        newsletter, which we may periodically send to you along with other information regarding the
        Site and our services. If you are not a subscriber of PrepScholar, but wish to receive our
        newsletter, you may sign up to receive the newsletter by providing us your name, e-mail
        address, ZIP code and other optional information.</p>

        will be providing us with your name, e-mail address and phone number, and any information
        you choose to include in the text of your message. For example, you may choose to provide
        your mailing address or other information necessary or helpful for us to address your query
        or other concern.</p>

      <h3>Technical and Other Information</h3>
      <p>While you are browsing the Site, we automatically log your IP address (a number assigned to
        your computer when you use the Internet) and your activity while using the Site.
        Additionally, in order to personalize and enhance your experience on the Site,  we may also
        collect information through ‘cookies’. Cookies are small strings of text that are sent by
        the Site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We
        use cookies to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. We also
        use cookies to gather broad demographic information and to help identify you in respect to
        visits to the Site so that we may improve your user experience, and to determine whether you
        visited the Site from a particular Internet link or advertisement. While a code in the
        cookie file enables the Site to label you as a particular user, including identifying you by
        name, address, or other personally identifiable information, such cookie files are encrypted
        in order to protect your information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it
        is possible to change your browser setup so that it does not accept cookies. However,
        rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions of the Site.</p>

        expressly requesting it from you (i) when you request information from us via our online
        Contact Us Form and (ii) at the time you become a general subscriber or paying subscriber
        of PrepScholar.</p>

      <h2>How is your information used?</h2>

      <h3>Our Use of Information</h3>
      <p>We collect, retain, and use the personally identifiable information we collect via the Site
        for legitimate business purposes only, including without limitation the following: to
        qualify you as a subscriber of PrepScholar with access to the password  protected portions
        of the Site; to provide the Site’s services to subscribers and to otherwise operate and
        improve the Site; responding to an inquiry from you or addressing a request submitted by you
        (including contacting you directly to request additional information to process your inquiry
        or request); contacting you to provide information regarding PrepScholar and/or our
        affiliates; providing you information regarding offers from third parties with respect to
        their products or services  we believe may be of interest to you; to correspond with you
        regarding the Site or our services; to inform you of developments in our company or with our
        services that we believe may be of interest; to monitor Site visitor traffic patterns and
        Site usage; to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of relevant
        regulatory and law enforcement and/or other governmental agencies; to enforce our Terms of
        Use; and/or to protect the rights, property, or safety of PrepScholar, our users, and/or
        others.</p>

      <h3>Sharing Information</h3>
      <p><strong><em>We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third
        parties.</em></strong> We may share offers from our affiliates, partners, advertisers and
        service providers with you. If you express to us your interest in any products and/or
        services of any of our third party advertisers and partners, we may provide your personally
        identifiable information to such third party advertisers and partners. We may also share
        with our partners, affiliates, advertisers or service providers, in aggregate, statistical
        form, non-personal information regarding the visitors to the Site, traffic patterns, and
        Site usage. In addition, if you are a paying subscriber and are delinquent in paying any
        fees owed to PrepScholar, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to
        collection agencies to assist in the collection of such unpaid invoices. Similarly, we will
        disclose information we maintain, including personally identifiable information, when
        required to do so by law, or may disclose such information in response to a request from a
        law enforcement agency or authority.</p>

      <h2>Use of third party personal information</h2>

      <h3>Referrals</h3>
      <p>You may choose to let other individuals know about PrepScholar through our referral
        feature. If you choose to use this feature, we will ask you to provide us with that person’s
        name and e-mail address. We will send him or her one or more e-mails inviting him or her to
        visit PrepScholar to learn more about our services. PrepScholar will store such individual’s
        contact information for the sole purpose of sending such e-mails.</p>

      <h3>Access to Your Account</h3>
      <p>You may also choose to allow other individuals to monitor your account, such as parents,
        guardians and high school counselors. If you choose to use this feature, we will ask you to
        provide us with that person's name and e-mail address. We will send him or her one or more
        e-mails inviting him or her to visit PrepScholar to register and monitor your progress. By
        inviting such individuals to monitor your progress, you are granting permission to
        PrepScholar to share the details of your profile with them. This information includes
        personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, e-mail
        address, grades, schools that are interested in you and other information you have provided
        to us.</p>

      <h2>Modifications</h2>
      <p>We strive to maintain the accuracy of any personally identifiable information that may be
        collected from you, and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to
        update our database when you tell us the information in our database is not accurate. It is
        your responsibility to ensure that such information is accurate, complete and up-to-date.
        You may view the information in your user profile by logging onto your profile page. If you
        wish to make any changes to any personally identifiable information you have provided to us,
        you may do so by making such changes in your profile page.</p>

      <h2>Opt out</h2>
      <p>If you are a general subscriber or paying subscriber of PrepScholar, you may opt out of
        receiving communications from us and our affiliates by logging onto your profile page and
        un-checking the opt-in box in your account information. In addition, if you no longer wish
        to receive our newsletter, you can opt-out of receiving any future newsletters by using the
        opt-out functionality provided in each newsletter.</p>

      <h2>Consequences of not providing information</h2>
      <p>You may choose not to provide us with your personally identifiable information. However,
        choosing not to provide certain requested personally identifiable information may prevent
        you from accessing and taking advantage of certain services offered by PrepScholar.</p>

      <h2>Protecting your personally identifiable information</h2>
      <p>Students enrolled via a school program who did not directly pay for PrepScholar’s products
        should be aware that we retain the right to share any information regarding their account
        with their school or district. If you are a general subscriber or paying subscriber of
        PrepScholar, you should not share your password with anyone. In addition, if you suspect
        unauthorized access to your information, it is your responsibility to contact PrepScholar
        immediately. PrepScholar personnel will never ask you to divulge your password in written or
        electronic communications or over the phone. Please be aware that Internet data transmission
        is not always secure, and we cannot warrant or guarantee that information you transmit
        utilizing the Site is secure. Because security is important to both PrepScholar and you,
        we will make reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.</p>

      <h2>Business transfer</h2>
      <p>PrepScholar may, in the future, sell or otherwise transfer some or all of its assets to a
        third party. Your personally identifiable information and/or technical information we obtain
        from you via the Site may be disclosed to any potential or actual third party purchasers of
        such assets and/or may be among those assets transferred.</p>

      <h2>Acceptance of these terms</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the PrepScholar
        Agreement and Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement,
        please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Site. By using the Site and
        voluntarily providing your personally identifiable information to us, you consent to the
        collection and use of such personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy
        Statement.</p>
      <p>In addition, by using this Site and providing us your personally identifiable information
        you explicitly acknowledge and agree to (i) the transfer of your personally identifiable
        information to the United States and to other jurisdictions worldwide and (ii) the
        collection and use of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this
        Privacy Statement.</p>

      <h2>Effectiveness</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Statement is effective as of June 17, 2013. We reserve the right, at any time,
        to modify, alter, or update this policy, and any such modifications, alterations, or updates
