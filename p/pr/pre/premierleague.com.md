Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

**HOW THE INFORMATION WILL BE USED**

We will ordinarily only use your personal information to send you information which you have requested or to otherwise respond to you. Personal information means details such as your name, postal/email address, telephone number, and/or date of birth. We also use and disclose general data regarding your information (which does not identify you as an individual) for the purpose of administering and developing the website.

**DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

All personal information you submit to us will be held in accordance with our responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 and related legislation. As a consequence we will not disclose this to any third party other than:

We and/or our member Clubs may at times wish to use personal information supplied by you to inform you of news or offers which we think may be of interest to you. In addition, we or the relevant Club(s) may also provide your personal information to appropriate and carefully selected third parties. We will always ask for your consent before communicating with you or allowing the Clubs to communicate directly with you. Please note that should you expressly consent to receive direct communication from a particular Club, you are also consenting to us passing your details on to that Club to enable them to do so.

At any stage subsequently you can also inform us that you no longer wish to receive information from us or third parties to which we have passed your data by clicking on the designated hyperlink at the bottom of the relevant communication. If you have chosen to receive emails from a particular Club, your data will be passed onto that club accordingly, will be held in accordance with their privacy policy, and you should contact them directly if you no longer wish to receive communications.
