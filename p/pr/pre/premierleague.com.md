**In this Privacy Policy, any use of the words "you", "yours" or similar expressions shall mean any user of this website whatsoever. Terms such as "we", "us, "our" or similar expressions shall mean the Football Association Premier League Limited.**

****We take the privacy of our fans, and those interested in this website, very seriously. This Privacy Policy explains the steps we will take in order to protect your privacy when using this website.

All personal information you submit to us will be held in accordance with our responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 and related legislation. As a consequence we will not disclose this to any third party other than:

(a) as required as a matter of law;  
(b) in the reasonable enforcement of our contractual rights;  
(c) to identify or resolve technical problems arising from the use of the website;  
(d) to deal with complaints from any party regarding the operation of the website;  
(e) as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy or in those parts of the Website where we collect your personal details.

We will ordinarily only use your personal information to send you information which you have requested or otherwise responding to you. Personal information means details such as your name, postal/email address, telephone number, and/or date of birth. We also use and disclose general data regarding your information (which does not identify you as an individual) for the purpose of administering and developing the website.

We and/or our member Clubs may at times wish to use personal information supplied by you to inform you of news or offers which we think may be of interest to you. In addition, we or the relevant Club(s) may also provide your personal information to appropriate and carefully selected third parties. We will always ask for your specific consent before communicating with you, or passing on your details to the Clubs and/or third parties.

At any stage subsequently you can also inform us that you no longer wish to receive information from us or third parties to which we have passed your data by clicking on the designated hyperlink at the bottom of the relevant communication. If you have chosen to receive emails from a particular Club, your data will be passed onto that club accordingly, will be held in accordance with their privacy policy, and you should contact them directly if you no longer wish to receive communications.

You may contact us at any time at info@premierleague.com to ask us to delete any personal information which we hold about you. We recommend that you should regularly review the personal information you have supplied to us to ensure that your information is correct and up to date.

Data stored on this website will be stored in a secure manner and we shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that any such data cannot be accessed by unauthorised third parties.

To the extent that any facilities provided on this website require the use of cookies then those facilities will not be available to you if you do not allow those cookies to be stored on your computer. A cookie is a small file sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the web browser. Any cookies used by the website are used only to enhance your experience of using the website and to collect and store certain information in accordance with this policy. Any use of cookies on the website will be done entirely in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. However, you are not obliged to accept any cookies and most browsers allow you to decline to accept them.

Any links to other websites on this website are outside of our control and are therefore not governed by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the data protection or privacy policies of these websites.

You have the right to ask for a copy of the personal data that we may hold about you. To obtain this, please contact info@premierleague.com with your request. We may charge a small fee to cover our administrative costs for providing this.

Due to the global nature of the internet, collecting personal data may involve it being transferred to countries both inside and outside of the European Economic Area. By using this website and providing us with personal information, you consent to its transfer to other countries which may not enjoy the same data protection measures as the UK.
