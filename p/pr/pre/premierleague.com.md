Please read the following page carefully.

**CONTROLLERS OF INFORMATION**

Any personal information provided to or gathered by www.premierleague.com is controlled by us. Details of our current Data Protection Officer can be obtained by emailing info@premierleague.com.

In order to provide you with the services you require, we may collect personal information about you from our website. This information will include, for example, your name, address, email address, phone number and details that are relevant to the service(s) in which you are interested.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, such as our member Clubs, other footballing organisations and our commercial partners.

**HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION**

We will ordinarily only use your personal information to send you information which you have requested or to otherwise respond to you. We also use and disclose general data regarding your information (which does not identify you as an individual) for the purpose of administering and developing our website.

**DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

All personal information you submit to us will be held in accordance with our responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 and related legislation. As a consequence we will not disclose your personal information to any third party other than:

**OFFERS AND OPPORTUNITIES**

We may at times wish to use personal information supplied by you to inform you of news, offers, events and competitions which we think may be of interest to you. In addition, we may also provide your personal information to our member Clubs and selected commercial partners. We will always ask for your consent before we, the Clubs or any of our respective commercial partners communicate with you. Please note that should you expressly consent to receive direct communication from a particular Club or commercial partner, you are also consenting to us passing your details on to that Club or commercial partner to enable them to do so.

**SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE**

At any stage you may inform us that you no longer wish to receive information from us or third parties to which we have passed your data by clicking on the designated hyperlink at the bottom of the relevant communication.

**SECURITY OF INFORMATION**

Data stored on our website will be stored in a secure manner and we shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that any such data cannot be accessed by unauthorised third parties.

**CHILDREN & PRIVACY**

It is important to us that children can enjoy our website in a responsible fashion.  We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their children's online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.

Your child's privacy is important to us. We are committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online, and to helping parents and guardians and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.

If you are aged 12 or under, we will require permission from your parent or guardian in order for you to register on our website.  If you are aged 12 or under you will be asked to supply the name and email address of a parent or guardian to whom a confirmation email will be sent.  Your Premier League account will only become active once your parent or guardian has clicked on the link within the confirmation email to provide their consent.

If you are a parent or guardian and would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child’s personal information or if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or practices, you may contact us at [info@premierleague.com](mailto:info@premierleague.com).

**PLAYER PRIVACY POLICY**

Some of the organisations to which we may disclose personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide the services you require, we may need to transfer your personal information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that the information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**PASSWORDS**

Where we have given you or you have chosen a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.

You may contact us at any time at [info@premierleague.com](mailto:info@premierleague.com) to ask us to delete any personal information which we hold about you.
