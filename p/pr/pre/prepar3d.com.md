Please review it carefully.  If you provide or continue to provide your personal information to us or use this website, you agree to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any subsequent amendments.

If you are located in the European Union click [here](https://www.prepar3d.com/lockheed-martin-corporation-privacy-notice-eu/) for the Data Protection Notice applicable to you.

**Our Commitment to Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

We strive to provide an environment in which our employees, customers, stockholders, partners and you trust us to handle personal information responsibly. We provide this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to privacy by describing what personal information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and with whom we share it.

**Scope of This Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors to our corporate website and affiliated websites sponsored by the Corporation. It may also apply to interactions that we have with you where we may collect your personal information, for example, where we collect information from our customers or service providers in order to operate our business.

Some of our websites, such as the [LMPeople](https://www.lmpeople.com/) and [Employee Service Center](https://www3.benefitsweb.com/lmc.html) websites that provide employees and retirees access to personnel and benefits information from the Internet, may provide more detailed privacy or disclaimer notices or policies, in which case they take priority over this notice. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available in the footer of every web page where it applies. Employees and others with access to the Lockheed Martin internal Intranet should note that this privacy notice will apply if linked directly from there; otherwise, our internal privacy policies will apply as defined in Corporate Command Media.

**EU-US Privacy Shield Framework  
**Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “LMC”) participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Framework”). LMC’s participation in the Framework applies to personal data about internal employees, prospective employees, and contractors received in the United States from the European Union and the European Economic Area (“European Personal Data”). LMC commits to subject to the Framework all European Personal Data that it receives in reliance on the Framework.

**What Information We Collect and How We Use It**  
While visiting our website, or in some instances you otherwise interact with us, you may be asked to provide personal information in order to accomplish the purpose of your visit. For example, you may be asked to provide your email address, residence, and other personal information to acquire services and goods. If you are a supplier you may be asked to identify the financial institution you use and provide account numbers. The specific information that you may choose to provide will depend on the nature of the transaction to be completed and is always voluntary. However, we may not be able to provide you with goods and services if you do not provide us with the information we request.

If you are located in Australia, where you provide us with the personal information of third parties (e.g. your employees or contractors), you warrant that you have obtained the consent of and/or notified those individuals as required under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) that you are providing their personal information to us and have provided them with a copy of or link to this Privacy Policy.

**How We Protect Your Information**  
We take reasonable steps (including physical, electronic, and managerial procedures) to safeguard and secure your personal information against loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. All personal information that we collect is protected using industry standard computer security and industrial security practices.

**With Whom We Share Your Information**  
Personal information collected from or about you by us will not be shared with third parties for purposes other than in support of our operations and as necessary to facilitate the purpose for which it was collected. In some cases we may share the information with service providers retained by us to provide services on our behalf.
