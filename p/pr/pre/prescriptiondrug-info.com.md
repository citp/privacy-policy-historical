## Data Collection

We collect information about our users in a variety of ways, some of which is automatic. When we collect information automatically, it is used to help us measure, optimize, and secure our website. Other Personal Information collected from users (such as an Email Address) is voluntary (opt-in) on their part. MedsChat.com is the sole owner (controller) of data which we collect from our users and it is only shared with Service Providers (processors) as outlined in this privacy statement or as required by law. Specifics of our data collection practices are further outlined below:

### Automatically Collected Data

We collect and store certain information inside log files and cookies automatically. This helps us to track high level statistics about our visitors, how our site is most used, and it helps us to secure our website. Furthermore, this allows us to ensure that we are providing the best possible service and to tailor content to users more appropriately. At a high level we record how you arrived here, what pages you view within our site, and some basic information about your computer and location. Please note that this information does not tell us who you are. It simply shows us that somebody visited our site.

Statistics which we track:

  * Date & Time a user accesses our site
  * Pages which are viewed and accessed on our site
  * Website address of the referring page / domain which brought a visitor to us
  * Browser and operating system version of the device which is being used
  * Which pages from our site are bookmarked or shared
  * When an email message which we send to our users is opened
  * Internet Protocol (IP) address provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Proxy Service through which someone accesses the Internet. While this is generalized information (for example, we cannot know a name, address, telephone number, or any other personal details just from knowing the IP address), it does give us a general idea of the geographic location (such as City, State, Country, and Internet Service Provider). If you are interested in learning more about IP addresses we recommend that you see the [Wikipedia reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address).



Statistics may be collected by third parties through cookies and other tracking technologies (such as clear images and scripts) when you use our site. This includes services such as AddThis, Google Analytics, and our Advertising Partners. These companies may track the same data as what we have described above using their own servers and they maintain their own privacy policies which are separate from ours. We may also collect and share hashed or anonymized user data with third parties.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to measure visits to our website and when an email which we send is opened. This includes a unique ID stored in the form of a cookie inside your browser so that the Analytics service can identify new vs repeat visitors and provide us with aggregate data as outlined above. Please note, however, that our Google Analytics settings block the transmission of your full IP address or any other Personal Information (using their [IP Anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052) method). Furthermore, we have disabled [Advertising Features](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en) in our Analytics account for added privacy. Lastly, we reviewed and accepted their [Data Processing Amendment](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3379636?hl=en) for the General Data Protection Regulation on 5 April, 2018. If you wish to completely opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

Because we employ multiple Google technologies (such as Analytics and Ads) you may also be interested in their page "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps"  
<https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners?hl=en>

### Personal Information

In using our service you may choose to provide us with your Email Address. This is collected and processed if you: Choose to receive notifications from one or more Discussion Threads; Subscribe to our Health Newsletter; Email yourself a Prescription Discount Card; Share a page from our site via the "Email a Friend" form; Send us a message via our Contact form or through your email account. This information is collected on a voluntary (opt-in) basis and is not required for you to view pages on our site. We expressly prohibit the posting of any Personal Information in our discussion threads (such as an individual's full name, address, telephone number, or email address). Such information will be promptly removed by our moderators once discovered.

Please note that your Email Address is not shared outside of our organization, support staff, and our Email Service Providers (see the **Service Providers** section for more details). As part of our internal security, we may tie your Email Address to the statistics which we automatically collect above.

If you share a page from our website via the "Email a Friend" form, we will also collect and process your friend's Email Address. We only use this information to transmit the email message for sharing content from our website on your behalf. Your friend's Email Address is never stored on our servers, but a copy of the outgoing email message (including the sender and recipient's Email Address) is retained by our Email Service Provider for up to 30 days. This is so that we can track and diagnose any issues which arise with our outgoing email.

### Reporting or Voting for a Post

If you choose to Vote on the helpfulness of a reply or Report a specific message inside our forums to us, we will store the IP address associated with the corresponding action. This is to identify usage patterns for preventing abuse to our service. We may also tie your IP address to other data which we collect from you as listed above.

### Social Sharing

When you choose to bookmark and share pages from our website using the buttons which we provide, you may be routed through the AddThis service and onto one or more social networks. Please note that AddThis and the target social network (as outside services) maintain their own privacy policies which govern the collection and use of the information collected on those sites.

### Prescription Discount Card

We offer a branded Prescription Discount Card / Rx Savings Voucher to patients located inside the United States. When an individual uses it to claim a savings on their prescription from the pharmacy, the process is handled by third parties (which may include the dispensing pharmacy and benefit managers DataRx or RxCut) who maintain privacy and data collection practices which are separate from ours. We are provided with reports containing the Member ID, the Date that a prescription was filled, the Name & Location of the pharmacy, the specific Drug which was dispensed, and the Cost of filling the prescription (but not an individual's name, address, or social security number). This data is collected so that we may understand how the discount card is being used as well as evaluating our marketing efforts of this service. If you do not wish for this information to be known by us, please do not use our discount card.

## Tracking Technologies

MedsChat.com and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

By using any of our online forms to participate in Discussion Threads, Send us a Message via our Contact form, email yourself a Prescription Savings Card, Subscribe to our Health Newsletter, or Share a page from our site via the "Email a Friend" form, your Email Address (plus your Name if it is collected) is stored in a cookie so that you do not need to reenter it the next time you visit our site. Please note that this cookie is not shared with any outside parties and is valid for a period of 90 days from when you last complete one of the actions above. If you select the option "I'm on a public or shared computer" before submitting the form, we will not store this information inside a cookie. If you wish to clear this previously stored information [click here](https://web.archive.org/privacy.asp?action=clear-email-cookie).

## Advertising

We work with third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. In the course of serving such ads, these companies may use technologies such as cookies to track your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, and we do not have access to read or write these cookies. Furthermore, such companies may link and combine user data with data from other sources. If you would like more information about this practice and opting out you can review [Your Advertising Choices](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads altogether. You will continue to receive generic ads.
