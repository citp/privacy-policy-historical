### **Information you Share**

**Account Information**

**You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public presentations. If you do choose to create an account and become a member, you must provide us with some personal information so that we can provide our services to you including your name, email address and/or phone number, occupation, title, and a password. If you choose to authenticate using a third-party account (e.g., Google), you authorize us to obtain account information from the third-party platform.**  
  
**Payment Information**

| 

**In order to gain access to specific premium features within our Services, you must provide us with payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.**  
  
**Support Information**

| 

**The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing.   For example, if you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.**  
  
**Survey Information**

| 

**From time to time, we may ask our registered users or visitors to participate in surveys. These surveys are optional. If you choose to participate, any information you provide to us, including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system. If you would not like your information to be used in this way, you have the option to not participate in surveys or, if you do participate, to provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**  
  
**Content Information (User Content)**

| 

**Parts of our Services allow users to upload, create and stream user content, including presentations, messages, comments, images, videos, and other materials. If you choose to upload personal information through these means in a manner that makes it visible to the public, we will consider that information public and will not limit its use or disclosure in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.  **

**You may create a profile and upload content such as presentations, videos, text, photographs, and artwork. Your profile may display information about you and your activities. This information may be accessed by others. Your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed by others, and associated metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags, etc.) are viewable by others. Your interactions with other users (e.g., comments, "likes") may be seen by others.  **

**We may associate certain content information (such as titles, metadata, and digital art assets) that is stored in your presentations, infographics, videos or other free-form content inputs, such as comments, with personal information about you or others. Information in your presentations, videos, and infographics belong to you, and you are responsible for making sure that your content complies with our  [Terms of Service](https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/). **

**If your content is made public, anyone (including us) may view its contents and potentially make other uses of it. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public presentations, videos or other content, such as your name, address, email addresses, and the like, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. If your user content is shared privately, those you have shared it with may use it in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Use, and/or inconsistent with your wishes, including disclosing it publicly. Please exercise discretion concerning those you share your private content with.**  
  
### **Information You Share About Others**  
  
**Contact Information**

| 

**Some components of the Services allow you and others to share user content and send personal messages with other registered users and non-registered users. To use this feature, you must provide us with personal information about others including an email address for each recipient. For example, when collaborating on a presentation you may want feedback from other team members or non-team members and you can do so by adding those members as collaborators.**  
  
### **Additional Information We Receive About You**  
  
**Use of the Services**

**Third-Party Services**

**We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect. For example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website. Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.**

**Services you link to your account**

| 

**We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services, including information from the third party who provides the linked service. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. We also provide options within the Services that enable you to link to services such as Slack and Salesforce, so you can receive real-time notifications and integrate content within those platforms.

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies**

Please see our cookie policy for more information about these technologies.**  
  
**Our Partners and Service Providers**

| 

**Prezi relies on a number of other companies, agents, and/or contractors to perform services on our behalf and to assist us in operating and providing the Services to you. For example, we may engage such service providers to provide marketing, communications, website hosting, infrastructure, and IT services, to personalize and optimize the Services, provide customer service, collect debts, and analyze and enhance data. In the course of providing such services to us, these companies may obtain information about you, including personal information, and that information will be shared with us.

## **8\. Information We Do Not Collect**

**The Services are for a general audience and do not direct any content, products, or Services at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If you are a user between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only use Prezi through an account established by a parent or guardian, with that parent or guardian’s permission – provided that in your jurisdiction there is no requirement for you or your parent to provide any consent to Prezi for a minor’s use beyond what is already provided in Prezi’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By way of example, in some Designated Countries users as old as 16 may be required to have their parent or guardian submit a specific consent to Prezi, and in those countries users under 16 years of age may not use Prezi.  **

**Also, in certain Designated Countries minors at or beyond the age of 13 might be permitted by local laws to give consent directly to personal their data processing parental or guardian permission. We urge you to familiarize yourself with your jurisdiction’s requirements on this subject. You can find useful information[here](https://www.betterinternetforkids.eu/hu/web/portal/practice/awareness/detail?articleId=3017751) or [here](https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2017/mapping-minimum-age-requirements/use-consent).**

**Prezi does not knowingly collect personal information about children not authorized to use Prezi – if you believe we have unknowingly collected such information, please contact us at[privacy@prezi.com](mailto:privacy@prezi.com). **

**We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although we do not request or intentionally collect such sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a presentation, video, and/or infographic. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage, processing, and use of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**
