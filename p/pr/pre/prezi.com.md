##  2\. Agreement to Terms of Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

Any Prezi Service you wish to use is purely voluntary.

##  5 Personal Information About You 

###  5.1 Types Of Information Collected 

We may ask you for certain information, referred to as "personal information," which includes information that pertains to your identity. Such information may include, but is not limited to, items such as your name, email address, and credit card billing information. 

### 5.2 Personal Information You Provide to Us 

You may be required to provide personal information to access or use certain parts or features of the Prezi Service. For example, you will be asked to provide your name and a valid email address to establish an account at [http://prezi.com](http://prezi.com/). If you wish to establish a paid Prezi account, you will also be asked (in some cases) to provide credit card account and billing information. If you do not provide the requested personal information, you may not be able to access or use the particular component of the Service where such information is required.

### 5.3 Survey Information 

From time to time, Prezi may ask its registered users to participate in surveys. These surveys are purely optional and help us improve the Prezi Service and provide aggregate information which we think may interest our registered users and visitors. We may use the information that you voluntarily provide as part of your survey response in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you choose to participate in a Prezi survey, any information you provide to us, including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system and to any personal information contained therein. We may also use the information you provide in the aggregate to help us generate statistics regarding use of the Prezi Service. For example, if you reveal in a survey response that you are a teacher, Prezi will know that you are a teacher, will retain that information in association with your registered user account, and may publish aggregate statistics based thereon (for example, statistics regarding what portion of our educational users are teachers versus what portion of our educational users are students). If you would not like your information to be used in this way, please do not participate in Prezi surveys or, if participating, please provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 6\. Personal Information You Provide About Others

Some components of the Prezi Service allow you to share content and personal messages you upload with others by generating messages directly to those other individuals. To use this feature, we require you provide us with a valid email address for each recipient. Prezi uses these email addresses only to share your content and personal messages (at your direction). We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store it after this one-time email is sent. This one-time email may also contain a short description and explanation of the Prezi Service.

## 7\. General Information We May Collect

### 7.1 Types Of Information Collected 

There may be other instances in which we collect information from you that is more general in nature ("general information"). Such information may include information recorded by our server logs from your browser such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which enables us to identify your computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network like the internet), and the specific webpage you requested. Such general information, including the click stream data and cookies, as mentioned below, may be collected from you whenever you access or use the Prezi Service, whether or not you provide us with any other personal information.

### 7.2 Click Stream Data

When you use the Prezi Service we may collect "click stream data" (server address, domain name, etc.). This information can be combined with information you have provided to us, which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits. We may use click stream data for traffic analysis or e-commerce analysis of our services, to determine which features within the Prezi Service are most or least effective or useful to you.

You can turn off all cookies, if you prefer not to receive them. You can also have your computer warn you whenever cookies are being used.

If you complete a Prezi survey that asks for employment information, we may publish statistics regarding which professions are most likely to use or not use Prezi. 



### 8.2 Business Transfers

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Prezi or substantially all of its assets were acquired, customer information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Prezi may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

###  8.3 Protection of Prezi and Others 

We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law, enforce or apply our [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Prezi, our employees, our customers, or others. We may disclose personal or general information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, which may include responding to requests and court orders from jurisdictions outside the United States. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. 

### 8.4 With Your Consent

Except as set forth herein, we will notify you or obtain your consent before your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. Registered users may, at any time, elect to stop receiving emails from us by visiting the [Settings page at prezi.com/settings](http://prezi.com/settings/) (requires log in). 

### 8.5 Retention of Your Information

We will only retain your information to the extent: (a) it is needed for the purposes which we have conveyed to you; (b) we are required by law to maintain such information; or (c) it is needed for us to address any issues or inquiries that you may have. When your information is no longer required, we will dispose of such information by destroying it or erasing it.

## 9 Protection Of Your Information

### 9.1. Security Measures

In order to protect both the personal information and the general information that we receive from you through your use of the Prezi Service, we have implemented various security measures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) on our online forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

### 9.2. Risk Of Interception

Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that information. While Prezi strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. By using the Prezi Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Prezi Service and that any personal information, general information, or other data or information received from you through your use of the Prezi Service is provided to us at your own risk, which you expressly assume.

## 11\. Links to Third Parties

For your convenience and to improve the usage of the Prezi Service we may insert links to third party websites. This privacy policy does not apply to such third party websites. These links take you outside our Service, and off the Prezi site, and are beyond our control. This includes links from partners that may use Prezi's logos as part of a co-branding agreement. The sites those links can take you to have their own separate privacy policy and although we seek to protect the integrity of our Service, Prezi is not liable for the content and activities of those sites. Your visits and access to such websites is at your own risk. Please note that those other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
