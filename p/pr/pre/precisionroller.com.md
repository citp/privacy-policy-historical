**What does the Verisign certificate do?**  
The Verisign certificate protects _you_. We have passed Verisign's strictest verification and authentication procedure, which allows you to be sure you know who you are purchasing from. Verisign has completed a stringent checklist of activities to ensure that we really are who we claim to be. The value of this process cannot be underestimated, and it is this that has been the foundation of Verisign‘s enviable reputation as the most well-known and trusted independent Certification Authority (CA). The certificate is designed to let you know you can trust us when you consider communicating or transacting with us, by verifying that we are who we say we are.

After completion of the certification process, Verisign has provided us with a secure key (certificate) that cannot be spoofed by any other site. This certificate guarantees information privacy and protects information in transmission between our web server and your computer using the highest level of encryption possible. This means that the information travelling between your browser and our site is not visible to any other party.

**What does ScanAlert's HACKER SAFE® seal mean to you?**  
HACKER SAFE sites help protect you from Identity Theft and Credit Card Fraud! HACKER SAFE sites are tested and certified daily to pass the FBI/SANS security test as well as the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard requirements of Visa CISP and AIS, MasterCard SDP and American Express DSS programs. More than 75,000 web sites use ScanAlert’s HACKER SAFE® technology for protection from hackers and third-party security certification to the highest government and industry standards. _This means you can trust our site, not just because we work hard to keep it secure, but because we partner with one of the industry's toughest security teams to provide independent testing and verification._

**Dynamic "real-time" security certification**  
ScanAlert's security auditing technology allows the HACKER SAFE mark to appear only when a web site's current security status meets the highest published government standards.

**How is the BBBOnLine Reliability Seal important to me?**  
When you are ready to make a purchase, you want to know that the company you will be doing business with is reputable. The Better Business Bureau has been helping consumers find reputable companies since 1912.

As a member of the Better Business Bureau and BBBOnLine, we have made a commitment to the high levels of ethical business practices and customer satisfaction that the BBB expects in a reputable business. We have a satisfactory record with the Better Business Bureau and we are committed to upholding the Bureau's policies regarding any possible customer concerns that might arise. 

The Better Business Bureau name is almost universally recognized by online users. _Just under 90% of online shoppers say they would feel more confident buying from a site displaying the BBBOnLine Reliability seal, than from one that does not._ The BBBOnLine Reliability seal is backed by the credibility of the Better Business Bureau system, which brings over 90 years of trust to the newest marketplace — the Internet.

**What do I gain from a Safe Shipping network site?**  
People are simply tired of searching the web only to find thousands of irrelevant and often absurd web sites. The SSN ia a guide to the tested best shopping websites in the world. High quality web sites earn high scores because they are owned by business people who care about quality. The web sites listed in the Safe Shopping Network have been tested by us to help you decide which ones you should shop at. You can see each web site's scores by looking at the bars on the right side of each web site listing. Higher bars mean higher scores and higher scores mean these merchants are working hard to earn your trust. We take the trouble to test and score each web site for you. This provides you with objective information from an objective source: Safe Shopping Network. 

**What are SSN Safety Ratings?**  
Safety ratings indicate how safe it is to shop at a particular website. Simply put, the fuller the safety meter bar, the safer it is for you to shop at that site.

**Security Policy**  
Your security is our primary concern. To ensure safe shopping, we use 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption security, which is the highest level of security available today for secure e-commerce transactions. All pages containing your personal information, including credit card numbers, name, and address are encrypted while in transit. That means it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. SSL encryption makes shopping on the Internet the safest way to use your credit card. It is much safer than making a purchase in a store or charging your dinner in a restaurant.
