_Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:_ We are affiliated with a variety of businesses, including merchants who supply the Gifts and rewards we make available to you, and work closely with these businesses to deliver the Service. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through the Service and particularly through e-mails you may consent to receive from these businesses. In other situations, Pretio Interactive provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a transaction, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business that is related to the transaction you have entered into.

_Agents:_ We employ other companies and people to help us deliver the Service and need to share your information with them.
