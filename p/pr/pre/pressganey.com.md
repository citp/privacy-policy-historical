### Online Behavioral Advertising (“OBA”) Notice

In order to provide you with a better, more personal experience on our Site, Press Ganey (“PG”) uses an Online Behavioral Advertising BA platform called Eloqua to identify how we can better serve your interests. Through Eloqua, PG asks for and maintains the personally identifiable information provided by you to deliver certain services or information to you. “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that identifies you personally, including, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, password, login ID and other contact information that you voluntarily submit to us.

Cookies are small text files placed in the “Cookies” folder on your hard disk and allow PG to remember you. The cookies placed are readable only by PG, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If you refuse the cookie, PG does not gather any information on you, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
