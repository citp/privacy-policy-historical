Consumers' Privacy Rights

MIDAS holds the consumer relationship in the highest regard and pledges: 

To ensure that consumers have the ultimate right to control dissemination of their personal information. We support the self-regulation efforts of the direct marketing industry and believe this action is the best way to protect consumer privacy. We support legislation and regulatory efforts, which introduce fair, workable guidelines that protect the privacy of consumers. We will work to ensure that any such guidelines are consistent with and complement established self-regulatory measures, and that they allow the consumer to continue receiving the benefits that sophisticated marketing techniques can provide.

To comply with all relevant legislation at all times and to implement such legislation as required.

To monitor privacy issues and assure that any changes in legislation or industry standards regarding privacy issues are reflected in our Privacy Policy. We are in constant contact with our client Web sites to identify and resolve misunderstandings about the law, industry standards or our Privacy Policy and to ensure their compliance with all self-regulatory and legislative obligations relating to the use of consumer data.

To work with recognised trade associations and organizations that support consumer privacy. We actively participate in the efforts of Europe's Direct Marketing Industry to establish industry guidelines that safeguard the individual right to privacy.

To provide services that benefit both consumers and marketers. Consumers benefit from our services through the realisation of lower prices that result from the marketers' more efficient communications approach. In addition, consumers realise savings in time and expense by being able to shop via the Internet. Marketers can better tailor their products and services to meet the needs of their customers with our assistance. Further, they can refine their promotional efforts to target only those customers for whose benefit the products have been produced.
