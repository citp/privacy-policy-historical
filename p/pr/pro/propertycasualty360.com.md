 **Information Collected from Tracking Technologies**

  *  ** _Information Collected Using Technology_** _._ ALM may use a variety of technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”, which are further described [here](https://www.alm.com/tracking-technologies/)) to gather personal and non-personal information (which is any information that does not reveal your specific identity) automatically (or passively) whenever you visit or interact with the Online Services. We also work with third parties to provide certain functionalities on the Online Services and to improve the effectiveness of the Online Services and its content. Separate and distinct from information ALM shares with third parties (as further described below), third party companies may also use Tracking Technologies to independently collect and store information about you and your usage of the Online Services and may combine this information with information they collect from other sources. Please note, we do not control Tracking Technologies used by third parties, and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing the Tracking Technologies. Some of the Tracking Technologies that may be used to collect information are described below. To learn how to turn off certain Tracking Technologies, see below.
  *  ** _Device_** ** _Information_**. ALM may collect certain, non-personal information about the Device you use to access ALM’s services, including but not limited to IP addresses for your Devices, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser language and other transactional information that does not personally identify you.
  *  ** _User_** ** _History_** : ALM may log certain usage information about your use of the Online Services, which may include a history of the pages you view. If you download and use any ALM software application on your Device, the log files will automatically be collected by the application and sent to ALM’s servers when your Device syncs up for the latest content available.
  *  ** _Mobile/Location Information_**.  We may collect additional information from you if you access the Online Services through a mobile device, for example your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, or location when you opt in for us to do so. However the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). If you enable location services for the Online Services we may collect regional location data periodically as you use or leave open the Online Services. We may also collect your location information from you IP address or zip code. We may also use location data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you.

When you log into ALM through your LexisNexis account or social networking accounts, link your social networking accounts with the Online Services or engage with Online Services through the LexisNexis platform or third party social media platforms, you understand that you may be allowing us ongoing access to certain information stored on those platforms. In addition, as you interact with the Online Services, you may also be providing information about your activities to LexisNexis or the third party social networking platforms, as applicable. You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information such services may make available to us by visiting the applicable platforms’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those platforms.

ALM may use the information collected from one portion of the Online Services on other portions of the Online Services, and ALM may combine information gathered from multiple portions of the Online Services into a single record. ALM may also use or combine information that ALM collects offline or from third-party sources with your information collected from the Online Services. Additionally, data collected from a particular browser or Device may be used with another computer or Device that is associated with the browser or Device on which such data was collected, or transferred to a third party who may be able to track your activity across Devices.

We use third-party ad servers and ad networks that use tracking technology to collect information about your visits on other services and when you access the Online Services to send you targeted advertisements. They automatically receive your IP address or mobile device identifier when this happens. They may also use Tracking Technologies to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize the advertising content and to serve you advertisements that are relevant to your regional location. We may also use information collected using third party cookies and beacons on the Online Services and in our emails to deliver advertising about the Online Services displayed to you on third party services. Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Online Services. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Online Services.

ALM also uses third parties to provide ALM with information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of users of ALM products and services. Such third parties track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information about ALM visitors and customers with respect to the Online Services and track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of users of the Online Services.

If you send ALM emails, you should be aware that any information provided in an email may not be secure or encrypted and therefore may be available to others.

ALM may, on occasion, choose to share the personal information collected about users with select third parties for certain purposes, such as the following.

You may opt-out of having your personal information shared for this purpose, as described in greater detail below.
  *  **Partner Products& Services Offered on the Online Services**. If you provide personal information to third parties, such as partners, sponsors or advertisers whose services are promoted or advertised on the Online Services, you may be providing your information to both ALM and the third party.

Personal information about you as an individual subscriber or registrant may be shared, regardless of your “opt-out” status, in the following instances:

  *  ** _Compliance with Law_** : ALM may release information if it is required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on ALM; and (2) protect and defend the legitimate business interests, rights or property of ALM, its users, advertisers, customers, sponsors, advertisers or affiliates.
  *  ** _Vendors_** : ALM may on occasion use third-party vendors to assist it in performing its business functions, such as mailing statements to subscribers, email distribution, processing data and payments, and providing customer service. Personal information may be shared with these businesses or individuals to allow them to perform their assigned functions, but is limited to that information needed to perform the assigned function, and may not be used for any other purpose.
  *  ** _Organizational Changes_** : Should ALM undergo a sales, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation, ALM’s accumulated customer information will be treated as an asset and, like other business assets, subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party. We may also disclose information about our users in connection with a commercial transaction where we, or any one of our businesses, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding.



 **LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**

ALM is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which it may link. This Policy applies solely to information collected by ALM. You should consult the respective privacy policies of any applicable third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.

 **PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, ALM has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information ALM collects online. Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your personally identifiable information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any social media or other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

You need to help protect the privacy of your own information, including maintaining the confidentiality of any account information or access credentials. You must take precautions to protect the security of any personally identifiable information that you may transmit over any public or untrusted network by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personally identifiable information. You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access, public or otherwise unsecured networks.

 **A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN AND NON-U.S. USERS**

The ALM site is directed to a general audience and not directed to those under the age of 18. ALM asks that minors not submit any personal information. ALM does not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 years of age and if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s personal information from our systems.

The Online Services is operated in the United States and is intended for users located in the United States. If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.

If you do not wish for ALM to share any information you supply when you register for an event (including any webinars and recognition dinners), such as your name, company name, postal address or email address, please specify this in an email to [ALMEvents@ALM.com](mailto:almevents@alm.com?subject=Privacy%20-%20Policy).
  *  **Turning Off Tracking Technologies** _._ You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). It is important to remember that many of ALM’s services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, ALM needs first-party cookies to log you in to read stories that require registration or a subscription. In that case, you may set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow ALM’s first-party cookies only.
  *  **Google Analytics**. Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Online Services. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to help implement the above uses of your information. To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, click [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). To learn more about how Google uses cookies in advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy located [here](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/). You can opt out of receiving interest-based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you, by clicking [here](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated). ALM also uses third party services for remarketing ALM’s products and services, such as Google’s Customer Match via the Google platform, whereby we will deliver targeted ads to you based on your prior usage on the Online Services. If you want to opt-out of remarketing, please email us at [ALMLegal@ALM.com](mailto:almlegal@alm.com?subject=Privacy%20-%20Policy).
  *  ** _Network Advertising Initiative_**. Some of our advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. However, if you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages from us after you opt-out, but other members of the Network Advertising Initiative will not be able to target you based on your use of the Online Services and/or third party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies, you can go to http://www.networkadvertising.org. If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected and to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to http://www.aboutads.info.
  *  _**“Do Not Track” Signals**_. Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitor’s choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, at this time, ALM does not respond to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms. Go to http://www.networkadvertising.org or http://www.aboutads.info if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements. Please note that the-opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out is applied.

Any California resident may choose to opt-out of the sharing of such personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by directing such request to [ALMLegal@ALM.com](mailto:almlegal@alm.com?subject=Privacy%20-%20Policy).
