**We may from time to time contact you by post with information on properties, brochures, new developments, forthcoming events or competitions from our property divisions and our holiday group companies.**

You may, in addition, indicate your preference regarding receiving third party direct marketing material by post.

If do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point (2) of "Your Rights" below. 

### **Your Rights**
