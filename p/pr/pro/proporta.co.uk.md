### Information about you  
  
When a customer registers at proporta.co.uk we ask for information such as your name, email address, postal address, and contact details, and then we keep a record of this information. All this is necessary so we can recognise you as a registered customer, pass on the correct details with your order, and ensure that you are happy with the service you receive.

We keep a record of any email correspondence you send us, so we can track any problems or concerns you've had. 

We'll also ask you questions at registration, and from time to time by email, that will give us information that will be used to improve your experience of shopping at proporta.com. You do not have to answer these questions, but if you do we can communicate with you in a more relevant way.

If you would like to revise the information you have provided to us, or feel that what we currently have on record is incorrect, you may update the information by emailing: [hello@proporta.com](mailto:hello@proporta.com)

2\. To outside research companies whom we may ask to contact you directly for your opinions on our service, and our partners' products and services (in which case we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function).

'Cookies' are really small text files that are stored by the browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox) on your computer or mobile phone. All websites use them to store such things as user preferences. Think of cookies as being a "memory" of the website, enabling it to recognise a user and respond appropriately. At Proporta we use cookies to keep track of what you have in your basket, and to remember you when you return to our site.

To order products on proporta.com, you do need to have cookies enabled. If you don't wish to enable cookies, you'll still be able to browse the site and use it for research purposes. Most web browsers have cookies enabled, but see Managing cookies for help to turn them on should you need to.

Cookies cannot hurt your computer. We don't store personally identifiable information such as credit card details in the cookies we create, but we do use encrypted information gathered from them to help improve your experience of the site. For example, to determine relevant related products to show you when you're browsing. We're giving you this information to ensure compliance with recent EU legislation, and to make sure we're honest and clear about your privacy when using our website.

### Data over the internet  
  
The internet is a global network, so it is possible for your data to travel internationally, which may include places outside the European Union. If you visit or shop at proporta.com, you're agreeing and authorising us to process data in this way. 

Back to top of page   
  
### How we protect information  
  
You acknowledge that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium for communication and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to us (or we send to you) via the Internet. We are not responsible for any damages which you, or others, may suffer as a result of the loss of confidentiality of such information.

We take every precaution to protect your information. To this end all personal information stored by us is kept on a server in a secure environment. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.

Back to top of page   
  
### How you can help us protect your information  
  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in non-protected environments - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Also remember to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
