**HOW THE WEBSITE OPERATES**

This Privacy Policy refers to Users who join The Website as “Members”. The Website enables Members to create a profile, interact with one another, promote their business or service, read content, sign-up for events, list their business in the directory, list their member events and make purchases.

  1. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION



In order to become a Member of the Website, Users must register for account credentials. When you register for account credentials, Project Eve collects certain Personal Information, including name, email address, and a self-selcted password. Project Eve may use the Website to collect, use, and retain all information, including Personal Information and Network Data, that is disclosed and uploaded by Members in connection with their use of The Website. “Network Data” means all data collected from The Website or that a Member submits including registration information, profile data, answers to profile questions, all Content and other information contributed by Members, and statistical information and analytics relating to usage and interactions within the Website. When a User signs up to become a member of The Websites, he or she is providing Personal Information to Project Eve, as such Project Eve and its designated administrators will have access to Personal Information and Network Data. In addition, Project Eve will have the ability to reset Member passwords upon request.

In order to implement certain functionality on the Website, Project Eve provides Members the opportunity to access and use third-party applications (“Third Party Applications”) created by third-party application developers (“Third Party Application Developers”). Where such Third Party Applications collect, store and use information provided by Members in some manner separate from the use made by Project Eve you will be presented with an opportunity to review and accept or deny the privacy policy associated with any Third Party Software Application. For each Third Party Application that you add to your profile, you should review the Third Party Applications Developer’s policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information.

  2. PASSIVE DATA COLLECTION



Like most web-based services, Project Eve automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser when you use the Website. We use a variety of methods, including clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”), and “cookies” to collect this information. The information that we collect with these automated methods may include, for example, your IP address, cookie information, a unique device or user ID, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on The Website, and the “referring URL” (i.e., the page from which you navigated to The Website). We also use cookies to recognize your account credentials (e.g., for sign-in purposes), and to store references to your account credentials and session validators on your hard drive. We may also include clear GIFs in some of our email messages in order to learn whether the messages are delivered and opened. We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve The Website and our other services and systems, and to provide services and information that are tailored to you. If any information gathered through passive means by The Websites is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, Project Eve uses information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms. Project Eve and other third-party research companies also collect information. Please be aware that other third parties, including advertising servers, advertising networks, web analytic services (such as Google Analytics) may set cookies or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services on The Website. We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies or other means of passive data collection. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties. We cannot control the activities of such third parties.

  3. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS



We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit The Websites. These companies may use aggregated _non-personal_ information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Such third-party companies may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Certain third-party companies, such as Google, may also use these cookies to serve ads to you based on your visit to The Websites and other sites on the Internet. We _do not_ provide your Personal Information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks. We reserve the right to add or remove third-party ad networks and ad servers in our discretion.

  4. INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES



We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third-party sources. This includes certain Personal Information that may be provided to us through the installation and use of social sign-up on third-party websites such as Facebook and Google+. If we directly combine information from other third parties with Personal Information that we collect on The Website, we will treat the combined information as “Personal Information” and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  5. HOW THE WEBSITE USES PERSONAL INFORMATION



We may use Personal Information to operate, provide, improve, and maintain The Website, and our other services and systems, and to develop new products and services; to prevent abusive and fraudulent use of The Website and our other services and systems; to send you administrative messages, and information about The Website, content, and services in which we believe you may be interested; and for other administrative and internal business purposes.

  6. WHEN THE WEBSITE DISCLOSES PERSONAL INFORMATION



We do not sell or rent email addresses and other Personal Information. We do not share Personal Information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. In cases of onward transfer by Project Eve to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Project Eve LLC is potentially liable. Please be aware, however, that any information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of The Website, becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by us or others without restriction.

Legal Requirements:

We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to prevent violation of The Websites’ Terms of Service, or our other agreements; take precautions against liability; protect the rights, property, or safety of The Websites, any individual, or the general public; maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services or infrastructure; protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or assist government enforcement agencies.

  7. CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP



In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of your Personal Information, including email addresses, to that entity. We will use reasonable efforts to notify registered users of such a transfer (by a posting on our home page, or by email to a Member’s email address that was provided to us, as chosen by us in our discretion).

  8. SECURITY



We use industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to maintain the security of such Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that it will remain free from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or alteration. Further, while we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent “hackers” or other unauthorized persons from illegally accessing or obtaining this information. We do not assume any liability to third parties whose information you include in your address book, contact list or any similar items, or which you post or transmit in any Content on a Network. To help maintain the security of your account credentials, please keep your password secure. If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using The Website or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of The Website. If a security systems breach occurs, we may post a notice on our homepage, or elsewhere on The Website and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us.

Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through a widget. Cookies may also be set by a widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by a widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it. The Website offers publicly accessible blogs and certain community forums.
