##  General  


Cookies are small text files that are being saved on your computer when an Online Information is visited. In case you access this Online Information another time, your browser sends the cookies' content back to the respective offeror and, thus, allows the re-identification of the terminal device. Reading the cookies allows us to design our Online Information optimally for you and makes it easier for you to use them.

##  Deactivation and deletion of cookies

In case you decide to block cookies, your browser allows you to deactivate and delete all cookies at all times. To do so, please consult your browser's help functions. This might, however, lead to individual functions no longer being available.

##  Overview of cookies used by us  


In this section, please find an overview of cookies we use.

a) Absolutely necessary cookies

Certain cookies are necessary so we can securely render our Online Information. This category includes, e.g.:

  * Cookies that identify or authenticate our users;

  * Cookies that temporarily save certain user input (e.g., content of an online form);

  * Cookies that store certain user preferences (e.g., search or language settings);

  * Cookies that store data to ensure the unimpeded playback of video or audio content.




b) Analytical cookies

We use analytical cookies to record the usage behavior (e.g., links clicked, search queries put in) of our users and to evaluate it statistically.

We need statistical information about the usage of our Online Information to design them to be more user-friendly, to perform range measurements, and to perform user experience research. For this purpose, we use the web analysis tools described in this section.

The usage profiles created by these tools using analysis cookies or by evaluating log files do not contain personal data. The tools either do not use user IP addresses at all or shorten them immediately after gathering them.

The tools offerors process data only as processors subject to our directives and not for their own purposes.

In the following, please find information on each tool offeror and how you are able to object to the collection and processing of data through the tool.

Be advised that with regard to tools which use opt out cookies, the opt out function is related to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time. In case you use several terminal devices or browsers, you must opt out on every device and with every browser used.

Beyond this, you can generally avoid the forming of usage profiles by generally deactivating cookie usage.

Within the scope of our Online Information, you are able to sign up for newsletters. To do so, we use the so-called opt-in procedure, which means that we will only send you a newsletter via e-mail after you have explicitly confirmed the activation of the newsletter service to us.
