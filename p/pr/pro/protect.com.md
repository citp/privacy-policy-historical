Thank you for visiting Protect.com (referred to in this privacy policy as “the Site”), which is owned and operated by One On One Marketing, Inc., a Utah corporation (throughout the privacy policy referred to as “One On One,” “us,” “our,” or “we”). One On One takes privacy and transparency very seriously. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be collected and treated as you make full use of the Site.

**Site Restricted to Individuals over the Age of 18**  
It is our intent only to collect personally identifiable information from individuals who are at least 18 years of age, who are legal residents of the United States with a legitimate email and mailing address, and who voluntarily provide such information by completing the registration process on the Site or by completing one or more forms on the site requesting information or services from us. If you fail to meet any of the age, email or mailing address requirements described above, you are not permitted to complete the registration process or any forms on the Site that request personally identifiable information.

**What the Privacy Policy Covers**  
By using the Site you are consenting to the terms of this privacy policy explained below and representing to us that you meet the age, email, and mailing address restrictions described above. We believe in permission-based marketing, and therefore have described below the information we collect from you and how that information is used by us and others. Specifically this policy explains how we treat “Personal Information” (information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, email address, phone number, and age that may not otherwise be publicly available) that we collect when you (i) visit the Site, (ii) accept, sign up for, or request any of our, or our Affiliates’ or advertisers’, offers or services, or (iii) use or buy any goods or services we market. This privacy policy also controls use of information related to your previous use of the Site, our products, and our services. “Affiliates” includes any business which is a subsidiary of One On One or under common ownership or control with One On One.

**Collection of Your Personal Information**  
We accumulate Personal Information when you choose to provide us various types of personally identifiable information through various means which may include, but are not limited to, responding to a direct marketing advertisement from us, submitting content in connection with a contest we are hosting, participating in interactive online activities through the Site or our Affiliates’ websites such as responding to questions and surveys, posting community listings, providing ratings, conducting searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chatting, playing games, entering contests, posting on bulletin boards, etc. We collect this Personal Information when you manually enter it into any online form available on the Site or an Affiliates’ website. In order for you to take full advantage of the Site, we encourage you to provide your Personal Information to us. Providing your Personal Information is, however, voluntary. You may choose not to provide us with your Personal Information by simply not entering it on the Site or any Affiliates’ website. However, if you do not provide us with your Personal Information, we may not be able to provide you certain services.

**Anonymous Information and Cookies**  
If you do not provide us any of your Personal Information, we are limited in the information we may collect from you. For example, we may be able to determine your IP address for the purposes of administering the Site and tracking Site usage. However, your IP address may vary each time you visit or it may remain the same depending on the type of Internet connection you are using or the location from which you access the Site. We may also collect information about the websites that directed you to the Site after you clicked on a text or banner link or an ad from another website, or the day and time you visited the Site and how long you spent on the Site. We aggregate such information to help us to compile reports as to trends and other behavior about users visiting our Site; however such information is anonymous and cannot be tied directly to you.

We may also use “cookies” and your Personal Information to enhance your experience on the Site and to provide you with personalized offers. A cookie is a small data file placed on your computer’s hard drive that contains information that allows us to track your activity on the Site. The cookie itself does not contain any Personal Information; however, if you provide us any Personal Information the cookie may act as an identifier to tie your Personal Information to your IP address or computer. You may choose to delete cookies from your computer’s hard drive at anytime or to disable cookies on your computer. If you delete cookies that relate to the Site, we may not be able to identify you upon your return to the Site. Additionally, if you disable your computer’s cookies, you may not be able to access certain features of the Site that require that cookies be enabled. The Site’s cookies cannot be used to read data from your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites. Additionally, our cookies cannot be used as a virus, Trojan horse, worm, or any other malicious tool that could impair your use of your computer. Our cookies are used to help us better understand how you and other users use the Site so we can continue to provide a better, more personalized user experience on the Site. We also share website usage information about our Site with those interested in running targeted promotional campaigns on the Site. For this purpose, we and our advertisers track some of the pages that you visit on the Site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).

Additionally, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These advertising companies may use information about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, visit [http://networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Google, as a third party advertising provider, uses a cookie known as the “Dart cookie” to serve ads. Google’s and DoubleClick’s use of the DART cookie enables them to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Site and other websites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google [advertising privacy policies](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
