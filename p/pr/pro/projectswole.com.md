### The Way Project Swole Uses Information

Personally identifiable information that you submit to us through the Project Swole website, will be used by Project Swole to provide to you the features and functionality of the Project Swole website and to operate and maintain the Project Swole website.

Any personal information, text or other content that you voluntarily provide in the course of your use of the Project Swole website, including but not limited to, information in your Member Profile, by participating in polls, discussions, comments and communities, is publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your User Name (but not your email address) is displayed to other Users in connection with the polls you create and messages you post in discussions. Any information that you post on the Project Swole website may be redistributed through the internet and may be viewed by the general public. We will not sell or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information to third parties. However, Project Swole may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial and marketing messages, and market research related surveys and other offers to you. You have an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of any such programs by sending an e-mail to info@projectswole.com with the term “BLOCK” (in all caps) in the subject line. We will also use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Project Swole website changes or for customer service purposes).

We will also use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as usage data, server log information, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, other technical data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Project Swole website and to create new features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

We use cookies, “clear GIFs”, and log file information to: (a) to assist with your use of the website by “remembering” information so that you will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits to the Project Swole website; (b) provide customized, personalized content and information for you; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics (such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.); and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

### When Project Swole Discloses Information

We will not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as traffic information and usage tracking information) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Project Swole website.

We may provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons in connection with the limited purpose of outsourcing of technical functions. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We reserve the right to release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

Project Swole also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that Project Swole believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions to avoid liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Project Swole, our Users or others.

You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting the Controls section on the My Dashboard page. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access, or making corrections, to your profile. It is your responsible to maintain the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

### Advertising Policy, Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

Project Swole allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Project Swole website. These advertisements fund the Project Swole site and it’s operation. It is important to note that they have no influence over the content of Project Swole and that we have placed descriptive text near all advertisements, clearly labeled with the words “Advertisement” or “Ads By.”

These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Project Swole website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies or other tracking technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

Project Swole does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if you respond to any advertisements, the advertiser or ad-server may collect certain information about you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Project Swole’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.

Data Security Project Swole uses commercially reasonable safeguards (physical, managerial, and technical) to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Project Swole and you transmit any such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Project Swole makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Project Swole learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

For that reason, Project Swole does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally identifiable information on the Project Swole website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Project Swole website at any time or in any manner. If Project Swole learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Project Swole website without verified parental consent, then Project Swole will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
