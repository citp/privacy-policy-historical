<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>This Privacy Policy is effective as of September 17, 2007</h2>
<p></p>					
<p>Proofpoint understands the importance of safeguarding your privacy and we take this responsibility very seriously.   We are providing the following Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures for the collection, use and disclosure of any information about you that we collect via proofpoint.com (this “<b><i>Site</i></b>”) or by other means.  
</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason and each version will apply to information collected while such version was in place unless you consent to (including by not opting out of) our application of a new version to information we had previously collected .  We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new policy on the Site.  We suggest that you consult the Site regularly to check for any changes to this Privacy Policy.  
</p>

<p>In this policy, “using” and “processing” information includes using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including without limitation collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.  
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our products and services, to provide quality customer service, to contact companies whose representative has indicated an interest in receiving information about Proofpoint products and to enable users to effectively navigate the Site.  
</p>

<p>We may collect your contact information in the following ways: if you sign up for offers on the Site, provide your contact information to us at a trade show, web seminar or similar event, download white papers from the Site, respond to a promotion offered by a Proofpoint partner or send us an email.  Such contact information includes first and last name, title, company name, industry type, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and company size (“<b><i>Contact Information</i></b>”).  We may also collect information about your mailbox size, which will allow us to classify your company by size.  We may combine your Contact Information with information collected from others in order to improve the quality and value of our products and services, and to analyze and understand how our Site is used.   
</p>

<p>We also use your Contact Information to contact you with certain marketing or promotional materials, as well as other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.  
</p>

<h2>Log Data</h2>

<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect technical and statistical data about your visit, such as your browser type, the pages you visit and any search terms you use (“<b><i>Log Data</i></b>”).  We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site.  We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer).  Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as “<b><i>Personal Network Information</i></b>” instead of Contact Information.  “Log Data” does not include Personal Network Information.  Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled “Service Providers,” “Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement” and “Business Transfers.”  We will use Log Data for any purpose.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Information</h2>
<p>In addition, we may cull certain data from within the set of Contact Information, Personal Network Information and Log Data we collect from you and combine that information with information we collect from other Proofpoint users and customers (collectively the “<b><i>Aggregated Information</i></b>”) in order to improve the quality and value of Proofpoint product offerings and to analyze and understand how our Site is used.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site, and to monitor aggregate usage by Proofpoint users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the service.  
</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure </h2>
<p>From time to time we may share your Contact Information with our authorized channel partners so that they can provide you with information on goods or services that may be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.
</p>  

<p>We may share Aggregated Information (after stripping of any information that would personally identify you) and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes. 
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td width="30">

<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>We use the services of Salesforce.com and other third party companies and individuals to perform Site-related services (for example, without limitation, website hosting, maintenance services, database management, Web analytics, and improvement of the Site’s features).  These third parties have access to your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.  For the specific privacy practices of Salesforce.com, refer to the Salesforce.com privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>Proofpoint cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas and notice of class certification), to protect the property and rights of Proofpoint or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
</p>
 
<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

<p>Proofpoint may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.
</p>    

</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
<p>You may review, update, correct or delete your Contact Information or Personal Network Information by contacting us.  See below for privacy contact information.      
</p>

<h2>Security &amp; International Transfer </h2>

<p>Proofpoint is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  We employ administrative, physical, procedural, and technological measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.  Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Proofpoint transfers your Contact and Personal Network Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.  For the security and international transfer policies of Salesforce.com, refer to the Salesforce.com privacy policy.
</p>
 
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>Our Site contains links to other websites.  If you click on a third-party link you will be directed to that third party’s website.  We do not exercise control over third-party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through this Site.  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.  The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
</p>
  
<h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2>

<p>This Site is not directed to children under 18.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal or contact information without their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@Proofpoint.com.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our files.
</p>  

<h2>Contacting Us </h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
