Your privacy is important to us. This statement outlines our policy on how we manage the personal information we hold about our customers, shareholders and others.

It is our policy to respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals. We are bound by the Data Protection Principles contained in the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Our Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment. Any information we hold will be governed by our most current Privacy Policy Statement. 

**Why do we collect personal information?**   
Our business is to meet our customers' needs for a range of services. To do this effectively, we need to collect certain personal information. 

**What kind of personal information do we ask for?**  
The type of personal information we may collect can include (but is not limited to) name, address and contact details. 

We obtain most of the information directly from our customers through application or other forms, and from maintaining records of information provided in the course of ongoing customer service. We may also obtain information from other sources. 

We may ask for other information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research, surveys or special offers) to enable us to improve our service or consider the wider needs of our customers or potential customers. 

If you choose not to provide the information we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service. 

**How do we use this information and who may we disclose it to?**   
While we may send you marketing material from time to time that we think will be useful to you, we are conscious of the need to respect your privacy. 

Unless you are informed otherwise, the personal information we hold is used for establishing and managing your account, reviewing your ongoing needs, enhancing customer service and products and giving you ongoing information or opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you. 

**Management of personal information**   
We train our employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals. We regard breaches of your privacy very seriously and will impose appropriate penalties, including dismissal. 

We have an appointed Privacy Officer to ensure that our management of personal information is in accordance with this statement and the Privacy Act. 

**How do we store personal information?**   
Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, mail, over the internet or other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. 

We may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. However, when we consider information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. 

**How do we keep personal information accurate and up-to-date?**   
We endeavour to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate and up-to-date. We realise that this information changes frequently with changes of address and other personal circumstances. We can generally update your customer information over the telephone.
