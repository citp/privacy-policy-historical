This information concerns, among other things, the data categories we process, for what purposes we process them, the origin of the data if we did not acquire them directly from you and, if applicable, the recipients to whom we have sent your data.  
---|---  
  
**The right to access**

(The right to be forgotten)**

 **** |

  * the data are no longer required for the purposes they were acquired or otherwise processed;
  * you revoke your consent, which is the basis of the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
  * you object to the processing of your data and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing or you object to data processing for the purposes of direct advertising;
  * the data have been processed illegally.
