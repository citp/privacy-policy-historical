# ProactivŽ - Privacy Policy

|  |  |  |   
---  
When you buy from Proactiv, either via our show or the Internet, we protect your privacy. Customer information is gathered so we can better serve you, and we make every effort to ensure its security and to treat your information responsibly.   
When you visit proactiv.com our system automatically notes which browser and Internet Provider (IP) you used for access. We collect this navigational information to help us design our pages, so we can provide the majority of our customers with the best shopping experience possible.  
  
We share identifiable information only with those parties entrusted with the processing of your account, the fulfillment of your order, and for providing you with information and updates about our products (please see below for instructions to "opt out" of receiving these updates). We've established procedures to protect your privacy, which we vigorously uphold. Of course, this policy does not apply to information we are required to disclose by law. 

From time to time, you may receive e-mail from Guthy-Renker or Proactiv in order to update your account or communicate information which we hope might be of interest to you. At any time, you may request your name be removed from our e-mail list by simply sending an e-mail to a Customer Service Representative at optout@guthy-renker.com. We want your experiences with Proactiv to be based upon your preferences.   
  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. 

A cookie lets you browse in the store, put items in your shopping cart, and return hours later to continue where you left off, with the items still in the cart. Cookies help us give you a better website, by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. By using our website, you agree that we may collect and use this information. Please be assured that accepting a cookie does not give us access to your computer or personal information under any circumstances. If you don't want to use cookies you can set your browser to refuse cookies. If you disable cookies, please call the appropriate order number, listed below, to place your order. 

**Secure Online Ordering**  
We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that protects your credit card information to ensure secure online ordering. SSL encrypts all ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so no one can read it in transit. When you place an order your credit card information is captured and stored separately from your order to further protect against unauthorized access. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal information. If your browser does not support SSL, or if you don't want to send your credit card information via the web, just call the appropriate Customer Service Representative from the numbers below.
