Privacy Policy 

Prometric, a part of The Thomson Corporation, respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites. This Privacy Policy outlines the information practices for Prometric Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used and with whom the information is shared.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [webmaster@prometric.com](mailto:webmaster@prometric.com) for clarification.

**Personal Information**

In general, you can visit Prometric on the Web without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.

You may choose to give us personal information, such as your name and address or e-mail id that may be needed, for example, to correspond with you, to process an order or to provide you with a subscription. We may also collect additional information, such as in connection with events, special offers, advertisements, contests or other promotions. It is our intent to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you on the Internet. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.

Furnishing your U.S. SSN or Canadian SIN is completely voluntary. It is used solely to identify you as a candidate in our system, allowing Prometric to match results with testing history and to deliver those results to the certifying company you elect to test with. If you do not wish to provide your SSN or SIN, we will assign a Testing ID number to you, which will be used to identify you in our system.

**Information security and ability to change or delete**

We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. Upon request, we will remove that information from our database or change/correct personal information that you state is erroneous. However, you should understand that information about you might come from a number of sources, including orders placed by you and third party mailing list.

We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to correct inaccuracies in your personal information. To correct inaccuracies in your personal information please return the message containing the inaccuracies to the sender with details of the correction requested.

Any information you provide is processed through Prometric in the United States.

Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site.

**Information Placed Automatically on Your Computer - Cookies**

With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

We will not share this information with parties outside the Thomson family of companies except as may be required by law.
