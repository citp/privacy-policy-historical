# Project Insight Privacy Statement

Project Insight (collectively, "Project Insight" or "Metafuse" or "Metafuse, Inc." or "we" or "us" or "our") has created this privacy statement ("Policy") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Policy and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.

For the purposes of this Policy, our "Services" refer to the Project Insight™ Website, Project Insight SaaS project portfolio and management solution and any connectors to other cloud business applications like the Atlassian's Jira SaaS, Salesforce.com, Zendesk and others.

## Cookies and other tracking technologies from your use of the Services

When you interact with your Services, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to your Services, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the website previously.

Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 'trial period,' you remain anonymous to us. Cookies come in two forms: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.

Project Insight uses session cookies containing encrypted or encoded information including your username and session ID. This information allows us to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in and are required in order to use the Services. Project Insight uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our customer or prior Project Insight website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website but will not be able to successfully use our Services.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Web browsers offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.
