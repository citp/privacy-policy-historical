**How the information is used**

ProZ.com offers to members the opportunity to have notice of jobs, translation questions, etc., sent to them by email. The **email address** is required for this purpose. 

Members are also given the option of showing their **names** , **professional qualifications** , etc., on their profile pages, or on bids made for translation jobs, answers proposed to translation qustions, etc. This information is optionally entered, and optionally shown by members. Members are free to withhold, or remove this information, at any time and at their sole discretion.

The **username** serves the purpose of uniquely identifying a member within the ProZ.com system. It is used not only in login, but also to refer to the member in public areas of the site. If a member makes a bid, for example, and does not want his or her real name to be shown, the username will be shown instead. 

The **password** is used solely for the purpose of login, and is not shown anywhere. 

The **password reminder** is provided by a member for no other purpose than to refresh his or her memory, in the event he or she forgots the password. A request can be submitted, causing the reminder to be sent to the email address on file. 

ProZ.com does share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

Apart from the desired username, which appears on each profile page and elsewhere throughout the site, the information collected by ProZ.com is not shared with anyone without permission.

We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Notification of Changes**

If the ProZ.com privacy policy is ever to be changed, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
