We received my daughter&#039;s "dream dress" within about a week of ordering.  Promgirl.net is one of the only prom dress stores we found that would allow you to return or exchange your dress if there was a problem, which is why we chose to shop here.  Fortunately, there was no need to exchange, as the dress fit well and was gorgeous.  I have been recommending this site to all our friends who are looking for a prom dress. ';testimonial[1]='<strong>Order</strong> 34486:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:Very happy with  our experience with Promgirl.net!!! Ordering was easy!  Size was ok...my daughter&#039;s measurements indicate a size 4 would be needed according to measurement chart of Mori Lee, but from experience we knew that would be too big. We ordered a size 2 & it fits perfectly!! Sizing would be the most difficult thing with ordering online...Price was comparable to dress shops that sell prom dresses...Nice prom dresses are just expensive. But the $40.00 coupon from promgirl.net helped tremendously, so THANK TOU! Shipping was very reasonable & it took about 5 days to get here.  So overall, VERY HAPPY WITH PROMGIRL.NET...THANK YOU! My only non-excellent rating is in the price...BUT promgirl.net is comparable to shops AND offered $40 off...I WOULD RECOMMEND PROMGIRL.NET! ';testimonial[2]=' <strong>Order</strong> 22760:<br> Hi Kim and David, just wanted to thank you for answering all of our questions before ordering the dress. We took her measurements and called about the correct size before submitting the order. We received the dress on the exact day you said it would be here, took only 3 days. We couldn&#039;t be happier, it is the Jovani 1494 and absolutely gorgeous. We were a little hesitant about ordering before trying on, but it fit perfectly and was in perfect condition, unlike some you try on in stores. We had called the prom store where we usually shop for dresses and was told that they would have to order it, so I decided to try that myself, your service is awesome. Also it saved me about $95.00 off of the price that it would have been in the store. Thank you so much, and we will be ordering again the next time. I would recommend prom girl to anyone. Happy in Oklahoma ';testimonial[3]='';testimonial[4]='<strong>Order</strong> 22799:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Hello I&#039;m from Mexico, buys for the first time on the Internet, clothing came in a week, promgirl is a serious and responsible. Thank you ';testimonial[5]=' <strong>Order</strong> 18535:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:WOW!!!!!!!!!! What a great site. Prom girl comes highly recommended. I placed an order on line and within a week I received the most beautifully made prom dress which was arrived in perfect condition. I can not rate Promgirl highly enough ,There was speedy communication and any questions i wanted answered,they responded without Haste. If like me you a weary of buying online,Then don&#039;t be. This has to be the best online shopping experience i ever had. Promgirl.expect a lot of orders from Rep Ireland as my daughter and myself have told a lot of girls who will be having their prom soon,to look at your sight. Keep up the great work From a very happy customer. ';testimonial[6]=' <strong>Order</strong> 16641:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> This Website is amazing the dress i bought is lovely i am soo pleased with it... i would recommend anyone who wants to buy a dress to buy it now!!!! :) Melissa ENGLAND x ';testimonial[7]='<strong>Order</strong> 16439:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:I was extremely grateful to promgirl.net as i left my shopping until last minute, but thanks to the helpful staff and delivery service i received my gorgeous dress in time for my prom!! i was very pleased!! Thankyou!! I will definitely be using promgirl.net again!!! Jade x x ';testimonial[8]=' <strong>Order</strong> 14990:<br> Live in the Uk, ordered two dresses for the Final of a modeling competition on the Monday evening, the dresses were required for the Sunday that week. Paid the $100 express worldwide ups shipping and the dresses arrived on Thursday morning. Please note: make sure Promgirl write gift or sample on box to prevent you paying the tax when it comes into the country although it is not much. The dresses by the way are exceptional, we have now used this service on three occasions and they have never ever let us down. The most reliable in terms of delivery/ advertising of products and the manner in which the goods is received.5* plus service. Royal Mail in England struggles to send a 1st class letter in the Uk so to get this service from abroad so efficiently is amazing. ';testimonial[9]='<strong>Order</strong> 11926:<br> Body: I tried ordering this dress from other online companies such as edressme and serendipity and only promgirl.net was able to deliver the dress. The dress arrived in 2days and was perfect! ';testimonial[10]='<strong>Order</strong> 11743:<br> Body:I cant write ENOUGH to express my extreme pleasure of dealing with Promgirl.net. I will heartily recommend them to all my friends! After placing an order for a gorgeous dress at an alternative site, I received an email that informed days later that it was OUT OF STOCK - not due in til way after Prom. I scouted many other sites, each time calling to see if our Mora Lee selection was available. My daughter was becoming increasingly frustrated of not being able to have the dress she had wanted so much. Then one early morning I happened across the site Promgirl.net Naturally searched to find our dress to see they had it. I waited til they opened & phoned to check availability. They did!! I was thrilled and immediately did the online purchase. Later after further browsing their site - I noted the expediency of their shipping. Seems that Promgirl has a GREAT reputation for getting your purchase delivered promptly, NOT LIKE other sites that make you wait weeks. We had another dilema ... Spring break & no one would be home to get the package. Horrified I called & the gentleman assured me that the dress would be arriving the day before we left! Well it did !! My daughter is elated - and she looks absolutely divine! Thank you ! Thank you Promgirl.net! We are sold! Surely prom & a young girl emotes many emotions... fortunately my next prom concern is in four years & a boy. But I can assure you, Ill be recommending this site to his date! D. DiCianni ';testimonial[11]='<strong>Order</strong> 11201:<br> Body:my item was a brilliant price, much less expensive than anywhere else i had found, even with shipping from the USA, it cost almost three times less than it was expected to cost in the UK, it just goes to show what you can find if you take the time to look. I would definitely use the site again, my daughter is over the moon with her fabulous dress, it fits like a glove and it looks a million dollars!!! ';testimonial[12]='<strong>Order</strong> 11121:<br> Wonderful dress and fast shipping. The dress is a perfect fit and the rhinestones are so glittery. My friends even thought my dress was a Roberto Cavolli!! Love it! ';testimonial[13]='<strong>Order</strong> 10370:<br> I am Dionne A. Henry from the British Virgin Islands, I purchased the lovely Jovani dress #11718 as I was vying for the title of Ms. Gorgeous. On February 24th, 2007, I was crowned Miss Gorgeous 2007 and also won all the segments including Best Evening wear. Special thanks to Promgirl.net with their speedy delivery and also their very good customer services. I recommended all my friends of your site. Thanks for making part of my dream into reality. ';testimonial[14]=' <strong>Order</strong> 10730:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:As my prom s not untill june i decided to purchase my prom dress early, expecting the dress to take weeks maybe months to arrive in the UK. Promgirl was great and i received my dress in 1 week. The dress came in excellent condition and it is gorgeous. The price for my dress was incredible cheap when comparing prices to the UK. Thank you Promgirl ';testimonial[15]=' <strong>Order</strong> 10583:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:As a very inexperienced internet shopper, I was extremely nervous about ordering online, particulary ordering something from the US as I am based in the UK, but my daughter had seen this dress on the Promgirl website and would not accept any alternative. So what I can say about the experience: WOW, WOW, WOW. The dress has arrived just a week after I ordered it, in perfect condition and the picture did not do it justice as it is absolutely princess perfect.

I placed the order and the dress arrived, as promised, 7 days later.Thats when the WOW factor kicked in. The dress is absolutely fabulous, so beautiful, and apart from a couple of minor adjustments fits as if it had been tailor made.
