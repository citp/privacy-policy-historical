We received my daughter&#039;s "dream dress" within about a week of ordering.  Promgirl.net is one of the only prom dress stores we found that would allow you to return or exchange your dress if there was a problem, which is why we chose to shop here.  Fortunately, there was no need to exchange, as the dress fit well and was gorgeous.  I have been recommending this site to all our friends who are looking for a prom dress. ';testimonial[1]='<strong>Order</strong> 34486:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:Very happy with  our experience with Promgirl.net!!! Ordering was easy!  Size was ok...my daughter&#039;s measurements indicate a size 4 would be needed according to measurement chart of Mori Lee, but from experience we knew that would be too big. We ordered a size 2 & it fits perfectly!! Sizing would be the most difficult thing with ordering online...Price was comparable to dress shops that sell prom dresses...Nice prom dresses are just expensive. But the $40.00 coupon from promgirl.net helped tremendously, so THANK TOU! Shipping was very reasonable & it took about 5 days to get here.  So overall, VERY HAPPY WITH PROMGIRL.NET...THANK YOU! My only non-excellent rating is in the price...BUT promgirl.net is comparable to shops AND offered $40 off...I WOULD RECOMMEND PROMGIRL.NET! ';testimonial[2]=' <strong>Order</strong> 22760:<br> Hi Kim and David, just wanted to thank you for answering all of our questions before ordering the dress. We took her measurements and called about the correct size before submitting the order. We received the dress on the exact day you said it would be here, took only 3 days. We couldn&#039;t be happier, it is the Jovani 1494 and absolutely gorgeous. We were a little hesitant about ordering before trying on, but it fit perfectly and was in perfect condition, unlike some you try on in stores. We had called the prom store where we usually shop for dresses and was told that they would have to order it, so I decided to try that myself, your service is awesome. Also it saved me about $95.00 off of the price that it would have been in the store. Thank you so much, and we will be ordering again the next time. I would recommend prom girl to anyone. Happy in Oklahoma ';testimonial[3]='';testimonial[4]='<strong>Order</strong> 22799:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Hello I&#039;m from Mexico, buys for the first time on the Internet, clothing came in a week, promgirl is a serious and responsible. Thank you ';testimonial[5]=' <strong>Order</strong> 18535:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:WOW!!!!!!!!!! What a great site. Prom girl comes highly recommended. I placed an order on line and within a week I received the most beautifully made prom dress which was arrived in perfect condition. I can not rate Promgirl highly enough ,There was speedy communication and any questions i wanted answered,they responded without Haste. If like me you a weary of buying online,Then don&#039;t be. This has to be the best online shopping experience i ever had. Promgirl.expect a lot of orders from Rep Ireland as my daughter and myself have told a lot of girls who will be having their prom soon,to look at your sight. Keep up the great work From a very happy customer. ';testimonial[6]=' <strong>Order</strong> 16641:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> This Website is amazing the dress i bought is lovely i am soo pleased with it... i would recommend anyone who wants to buy a dress to buy it now!!!! :) Melissa ENGLAND x ';testimonial[7]='<strong>Order</strong> 16439:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:I was extremely grateful to promgirl.net as i left my shopping until last minute, but thanks to the helpful staff and delivery service i received my gorgeous dress in time for my prom!! i was very pleased!! Thankyou!! I will definitely be using promgirl.net again!!! Jade x x ';testimonial[8]=' <strong>Order</strong> 14990:<br> Live in the Uk, ordered two dresses for the Final of a modeling competition on the Monday evening, the dresses were required for the Sunday that week. Paid the $100 express worldwide ups shipping and the dresses arrived on Thursday morning. Please note: make sure Promgirl write gift or sample on box to prevent you paying the tax when it comes into the country although it is not much. The dresses by the way are exceptional, we have now used this service on three occasions and they have never ever let us down. The most reliable in terms of delivery/ advertising of products and the manner in which the goods is received.5* plus service. Royal Mail in England struggles to send a 1st class letter in the Uk so to get this service from abroad so efficiently is amazing. ';testimonial[9]='<strong>Order</strong> 11926:<br> Body: I tried ordering this dress from other online companies such as edressme and serendipity and only promgirl.net was able to deliver the dress. The dress arrived in 2days and was perfect! ';testimonial[10]='<strong>Order</strong> 11743:<br> Body:I cant write ENOUGH to express my extreme pleasure of dealing with Promgirl.net. I will heartily recommend them to all my friends! After placing an order for a gorgeous dress at an alternative site, I received an email that informed days later that it was OUT OF STOCK - not due in til way after Prom. I scouted many other sites, each time calling to see if our Mora Lee selection was available. My daughter was becoming increasingly frustrated of not being able to have the dress she had wanted so much. Then one early morning I happened across the site Promgirl.net Naturally searched to find our dress to see they had it. I waited til they opened & phoned to check availability. They did!! I was thrilled and immediately did the online purchase. Later after further browsing their site - I noted the expediency of their shipping. Seems that Promgirl has a GREAT reputation for getting your purchase delivered promptly, NOT LIKE other sites that make you wait weeks. We had another dilema ... Spring break & no one would be home to get the package. Horrified I called & the gentleman assured me that the dress would be arriving the day before we left! Well it did !! My daughter is elated - and she looks absolutely divine! Thank you ! Thank you Promgirl.net! We are sold! Surely prom & a young girl emotes many emotions... fortunately my next prom concern is in four years & a boy. But I can assure you, Ill be recommending this site to his date! D. DiCianni ';testimonial[11]='<strong>Order</strong> 11201:<br> Body:my item was a brilliant price, much less expensive than anywhere else i had found, even with shipping from the USA, it cost almost three times less than it was expected to cost in the UK, it just goes to show what you can find if you take the time to look. I would definitely use the site again, my daughter is over the moon with her fabulous dress, it fits like a glove and it looks a million dollars!!! ';testimonial[12]='<strong>Order</strong> 11121:<br> Wonderful dress and fast shipping. The dress is a perfect fit and the rhinestones are so glittery. My friends even thought my dress was a Roberto Cavolli!! Love it! ';testimonial[13]='<strong>Order</strong> 10370:<br> I am Dionne A. Henry from the British Virgin Islands, I purchased the lovely Jovani dress #11718 as I was vying for the title of Ms. Gorgeous. On February 24th, 2007, I was crowned Miss Gorgeous 2007 and also won all the segments including Best Evening wear. Special thanks to Promgirl.net with their speedy delivery and also their very good customer services. I recommended all my friends of your site. Thanks for making part of my dream into reality. ';testimonial[14]=' <strong>Order</strong> 10730:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:As my prom s not untill june i decided to purchase my prom dress early, expecting the dress to take weeks maybe months to arrive in the UK. Promgirl was great and i received my dress in 1 week. The dress came in excellent condition and it is gorgeous. The price for my dress was incredible cheap when comparing prices to the UK. Thank you Promgirl ';testimonial[15]=' <strong>Order</strong> 10583:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:As a very inexperienced internet shopper, I was extremely nervous about ordering online, particulary ordering something from the US as I am based in the UK, but my daughter had seen this dress on the Promgirl website and would not accept any alternative. So what I can say about the experience: WOW, WOW, WOW. The dress has arrived just a week after I ordered it, in perfect condition and the picture did not do it justice as it is absolutely princess perfect. Tracking my parcel was easy via USPS so I knew exactly when it came into the country and how much I would need to pay in customs charges, which by the way are minimal. Thank you so much for making my daughters prom all she dreamed it would be. Only 3 years to wait until the next daughters prom, Ill be back!! ';testimonial[16]='<strong>Order</strong> 10449:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body:We stumbled upon the Promgirl site and were amazed at the dresses we saw there. My daughter fell in love with one particular dress and we decided to order it. I emailed a query regarding sizing and the reply was back within a couple of hours. We ordered and were able to track the dress as it made its way to us - it arrived within a few days When we opened the parcel we were absolutely delighted with the dress. It was as beautiful in real life as it was in the photos. We are truly thrilled with our purchase and will be placing another order later in the year a graduation gown. ';testimonial[17]='<strong>Order</strong> 9831:<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> Body: I was extremely delighted with my purchase for my daughter formal. It was very easy to track and I knew exactly which day it would arrive so that someone could be there to sign for it. I had sent an email and had avery quick response. Well done to all concerned and Thank You Pauline McGuigan Belfast Northern Ireland ';testimonial[18]='<strong>Order</strong> 5603:<br> Hi David<br> Just a short e-mail to let you no that My Daughter Claire WON the Miss Wales competition and will now represent her Country at the Miss World finals in China in December. She looked absolutely stunning in the Paris Dress and a pop star judge Lisa Scott-Lee asked her for your website address as she loved it. You can check out a picture of Claire in the dress on <b>Miss Wales 2005</b>,<br> thank you<br> Michelle<br> ';testimonial[19]='<strong>Order:</strong> 4877<br> Living in the UK, I was a little apprehensive about ordering and paying for a dress with out actually seeing it or trying it on. But, this was my daughters dream dress for her Prom, she had been looking at it for about six months, and no matter how many dresses we looked at it always came back to this one. <br> I sent a couple of e mails re sizes/availability etc before I ordered, the response was really impressive. I placed the order and the dress arrived, as promised, 7 days later.Thats when the WOW factor kicked in. The dress is absolutely fabulous, so beautiful, and apart from a couple of minor adjustments fits as if it had been tailor made. SO, one very big thank you to Prom Dresses and Homecoming Gowns for making my daughters dream come true. ';testimonial[20]='<strong>Order: </strong> 2460<br> Regarding order #prom2000-2460 we received our order today.  We ordered Mori Lee dress style #7103 in a size 6.  It is beautiful!!!!!!  It fits perfectly!  We are very happy with the service we received.  To tell you the truth I was a little leary about ordering the dress on-line but since the price was $100 less than the exact same dress that my daughter tried on at a store we had to give it a try.  Wow are we impressed.  We are going to share your website with everyone we know!  Thanks again.<br> Linda<br> ';testimonial[21]='<strong>Order:</strong>  1221<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> <strong>Comments:</strong>  Prom Dresses was very prompt in expediting the order and delivering it.

';testimonial[23]='<strong>Order:</strong>  1171<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excellent <br> <strong>Comments:</strong>  Promgirl, has to be one the finest experiences I have had shopping on the web. We tried to get the Prom dress we wanted locally, only to be told we would have to wait three weeks for delivery, and then alterations. I ordered from Promgirl, on a Friday, and on Monday had a beautifully packaged, perfect exact dress! This store is not to be outdone. Superior Customer Service, We paid $100.00 less than our local bridal store and immediate shipment. Could not find better anywhere! I would highly recommend to everyone!

';testimonial[32]='<strong>Order:</strong>  9237 <br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Good <br> <strong>Comments:</strong> My daughter found the perfect prom dress - but it was less than 12 days before her prom! I phoned to make sure that it was available in her size. The salesperson was very pleasant; he assured me that it was available. I ordered the dress immediately - it was shipped the next day!! The dress is just as beautiful as my daughter had hoped; it fit perfectly, the quality is excellent, and the consensus at school is that she wore the most beautiful gown at prom. Thank you for helping make a very special event even more memorable!! ';testimonial[33]='<strong>Order:</strong>  8468 <br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Good <br> <strong>Comments:</strong> I was exceedingly happy with the ease of ordering, the selection offered, and the quality of the item received. The dress is lovely, and my daughter is ecstatic! We received it one full day before we expected it, which was a pleasant surprise. Happily, my daughter wont have to suffer any last-minute angst waiting for her dress to be delivered and wondering whether it will fit once it gets here. Well definitely be shopping here when it comes time to purchase her dresses for next years winter formal, and, of course, for her senior prom, too.

We are both very satisfied with the high quality of service, and we know if we had went out to a department store we wouldnt have been nearly as satisfied. ';testimonial[36]='<strong>Order:</strong>  8255 <br> <strong>Rating:</strong>  Excelent <br> <strong>Comments:</strong> I purchased my daughters prom dress from Promgirl.netand saved at least $75.00. I could not believe how quickly it came! I ordered late on a Wednesday afternoon and it had arrived on Friday!! I was very pleased with the packing and I felt confident that the dress had not been tried on and damaged as I found in the shops that we went to for dresses. I would recommend Promgirl.net to everyone!! ';testimonials('testimonials',2,testimonial);</script><br><br><a href="cuco.html">more testimonials...</a></div><br>
