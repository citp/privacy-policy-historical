We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site. Your IP address is used to help identify you, track the state of your session and to gather broad demographic information. 

Our forums are membership based and require a log-in for participation. The required demographic information gathered during the log-in process is utilized for marketing purposes to generate advertising revenue. By this we mean that we use general demographic information to describe the average PSW visitors in an attempt to encourage manufacturers to utilize the site for advertising purposes. 

We may also use this information to query individuals about interest in participating in additional on-line activities (on-line surveys, e-newsletters etc...). Members will be asked if they are interested in any of these additional opportunities. Once asked and answered, you will not be asked again about the same opportunities (we will not bug you to death with unwanted e-mails). If members choose to participate they may opt out of participation at any time.
