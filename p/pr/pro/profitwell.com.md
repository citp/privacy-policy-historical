# ProfitWell

Our lawyers made the below nice and legal (because that's their job). They did let us put together this summary though, which let's us boil down everything you're about to read in a nice, easy to understand context. Do your dilligence on the below though (that's your job). If anything doesn't make sense or you'd like to put together custom terms, email us at [product@profitwell.com.](mailto:product@profitwell.com). For most companies we're happy to oblige to fulfill your security, compliance, and privacy requirements. 

##### We do not and will not sell your data

To be crystal clear - **_ProfitWell does not and will not ever sell your data to third parties. Your data is your data._** Further, your data is rarely accessed with the only reasons we'd ever look at your data is if there's a QA or security issue, or if you give us permission for the purposes of analysis and helping you with identifying problems/opportunities in your business. 

We do study data in aggregate to improve our products, security, and knowledge of the market to help you. If you'd like to opt out of this, you can through signing a custom Terms of Use with us. Just email [product@profitwell.com.](mailto:product@profitwell.com) to get the ball rolling.

How do we make money then? Well, we do this by showing you problems and opportunities in your business through the free metrics and then sell you tools to solve those problems automatically for you. We think that's just a better way of doing business, because selling you graphs (although they're beautiful and insightful) just doesn't feel right.
