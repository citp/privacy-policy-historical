# Privacy Policy -

We provide a service that allows you and your team to be more productive in your product management processes.

Our privacy policy is reviewed at regular intervals to ensure it meets the current statutory requirements.

This policy covers ProdPad and CreateShift websites (including www.prodpad.com, www.createshift.com) as well as the software and services made available through the ProdPad APIs. By using CreateShift services you are agreeing to this privacy policy.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy CreateShift Ltd (a UK registered company with the registered office Kemp House, 152 City Road, London EC1V 2NX) is the data controller “CreateShift”.

Our cookie policy is detailed [here](https://www.prodpad.com/cookie-policy/).

Data Type | Processing Location | Processor | GDPR Legal Basis | Retention Period  
---|---|---|---|---  
Customer Data | EU | CreateShift Ltd, AWS Inc | N/A | Until Hard Delete is requested  
Personal Information | EU, US | CreateShift Ltd, AWS Inc, Zendesk Inc, Mailchimp Inc, Intercom Inc | Legitimate Interest, Contractual | Varies (see Appendix A)  
Billing Information | EU, US | Recurly Inc, Stripe Inc | Contractual | 6 years as required by UK statutory obligations  
  
## Customer Data

Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as “Customer Data”. As further explained below, Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that created the account (the “Customer”). Where ProdPad collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf of the Customer.

If you join an account and create a user profile, you are a “user,” as further described in the [Terms of Service](https://www.prodpad.com/terms-of-service). If you are using the Services by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place.

CreateShift employees or contractors only access Customer Data at the request of Customer in order to provide support.

Customer Data is retained until a Hard Delete is requested by the Customer.

### Customer Feedback

As part of providing Services to the Customer, CreateShift collects customer feedback and customer details (name, email, social media, telephone and avatar images) on behalf of the Customer and serves as a processor of that data for the Customer.

For the purposes of GDPR, we are a data processor of customer feedback on behalf of our clients. If you wish to exercise your data subject rights, you’ll need to contact the client who is the data controller. If you make a request of us in relation to this, we will redirect your request to the client and let you know we have done so.

## Billing Information

Billing information is collected in order to fulfill the contract of providing Services to the Customer. The collected billing information includes credit card details, billing address and billing contact. According to UK law, we are obliged to retain these details for a period of 6 years.

The billing information is processed by Recurly Inc. and Stripe Inc. both of which process the data in the US. The data is transferred to the US under the US-EU Privacy Shield and US-Swiss Privacy Shield.

## Personal Information

## Other Information

If you feel that a child’s data is being processed without an appropriate lawful basis, you should contact the company or organization that collected the data in the first place with your concerns. You may contact us and we will redirect your enquiry to the company or organization concerned as required by the GDPR.

We care about the trust you place in us in providing us with your company and personal information. While no one can guarantee 100% security, we have in place various methods of securing your data including:

  * Encryption-in-rest and in-transit
  * Minimization of personal data collected to what is required to deliver the Services and websites
  * Usage of firewalls, regular vulnerability scans and intrusion detection

We don’t do any automated decision-making or profiling.

We may allow service providers and other third parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies to track your browsing activity over time and across our Site and third party websites.

Other companies’ use of their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track or similar signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

We will not disclose Customer Data or Personal Information to any government, except as necessary to comply with the law or a valid and binding order of a law enforcement agency (such as a subpoena or court order).

If a law enforcement agency sends us a demand for Customer Data or Personal Information, we will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from Customer or Individual. As part of this effort, we may provide Customer or Individual’s basic contact information to the law enforcement agency.

If compelled to disclose Customer Data or Personal Information to a law enforcement agency, then we will give Customer or Individual reasonable Notice of the demand to allow the Customer or Individual to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.

In this event, we will notify you of any Business Transition. We will also notify you of any subsequent material changes to this Privacy Policy as a result of a Business Transaction and give you the opportunity to opt-out for information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a new Privacy Policy containing material changes takes effect.

CreateShift may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our business. We will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review our Privacy Policy to stay informed.

If we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, CreateShift will provide additional notice, such as via email or through the Services. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should deactivate your Services account. Contact the Customer if you wish to request the removal of Personal Data under their control.
