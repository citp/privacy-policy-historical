By law, you are permitted to limit some types of sharing, but not others.

Prosper shares your information with third parties as permitted by law, including in the following specific ways:

  * Originating Banks. All loans originated through Prosper are made by a third party bank that may extend credit to you (“originating bank”). If you apply for a loan through Prosper, you are also providing your information to the potential originating bank, and further information may be provided to that bank after your loan originates. The use of your information by your originating bank is governed by that bank’s privacy policy.


  * Third Party Financing Platforms. Certain loan applications through Prosper Healthcare Lending may also be processed by another online finance platform, to which you are providing your information when you apply for a loan. The use of your information by that online financing platform is governed by that company’s privacy policy.


  * Third Party Service Providers. Prosper relies on third party service providers to help us conduct our business and marketing activities, such as maintaining our files and records, offering customer service, sending marketing communications, or facilitating fund transfers. Prosper may share your information with such companies, which are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to Prosper. Information may also be shared among affiliates (including but not limited to the companies covered by this policy) for this purpose where one affiliated company provides services to or on behalf of another affiliated company in connection with your account or application.


  * Potential Purchasers of Personal Loan. Prosper shares your information, including your Prosper Borrower Rating, on an anonymous basis to allow potential purchasers to decide whether to commit to your personal loan. This information is also contained anonymously in personal loan data files available through Prosper’s Developer Tools and Marketplace Performance pages. Although your credit information is displayed, your identity is never shared with investors until your personal loan has been purchased.


  * Purchasers of Personal Loan. If Prosper sells your personal loan originated through our platform, we may provide the purchaser of your personal loan with your personal and credit information. Information is only released to personal loan purchasers that are qualified financial institutions with adequate protections to safeguard your personal information. Information provided to investors in connection with sales of our fractional Borrower Payment Dependent Notes (“Notes”) will not include personal identifying information. For more information on Notes, please see our [Prospectus](https://www.prosper.com/prospectus).


  * Referral Partners. If you were referred to Prosper by another company (a “Referral Partner”) or person, Prosper will share your information as necessary to honor the terms of its agreement with that Referral Partner or person and to process your transaction. In some cases Prosper may share with a Referral Partner for that Referral Partner’s own business purposes, such as to analyze and improve its business and provide targeted marketing offers to you. Your rights with respect to this sharing are discussed in the following section.


  * Merchants or Service Providers. If you applied for a loan to be used with a merchant or service provider, Prosper may share your information with the merchant or service provider associated with your loan application.


  * Credit Bureaus. Prosper may share your personal information with credit bureaus to meet our credit reporting obligations.


  * Affiliates. Prosper affiliates, including entities covered by this policy and other companies related by common ownership or control may share your information with each other, including information related to your creditworthiness, for purposes of general business analysis or to present targeted marketing offers to you or others. Your rights with respect to this sharing are discussed in the following section.


  * Legal Requests & Regulatory Requirements. Prosper may also share information to comply with, or to allow investors or potential investors to comply with, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or for the purposes of limiting fraud; or in connection with an audit or the sale of Prosper to a third party.


  * Sharing of Anonymized Data. Prosper may share aggregated and anonymized data sets including your information with third parties, including but not limited to business partners, service providers, loan purchasers, potential loan purchasers, and among Prosper affiliates. No personally identifiable information will be included in these data sets.

**IMPORTANT PRIVACY CHOICES**

**_Consent to information sharing with third party companies (Referral Partners)_** **:** By accepting this privacy policy, you agree that Prosper may immediately begin sharing your information with any third party company that referred you to Prosper so that that company may use your information for their own business purposes, including to market to you. For example, if you were referred to Prosper by another company through a website link or telephone transfer, Prosper may share some of your information, such as the existence and terms of your loan, with that company. You may revoke this consent at any time by following the procedures outlined below. If you revoke consent we will not subsequently share your information with these companies except as necessary to complete the transaction you initiated.

**_Right to restrict information sharing with companies we own or control (affiliates)_** **:** Prosper may share your information among affiliated companies whether or not those companies are covered by this policy. Federal law gives you the right to limit this sharing where it includes information about your creditworthiness other than your transactions and experiences with Prosper or is used for the purpose of marketing to you. If you would like to opt-out of this type of sharing, please follow the instructions below. We may begin sharing your information related to your creditworthiness or any information to be used for marketing purposes 30 days from the date that we first provided this notice if you have not opted-out.

**In order to revoke your consent for information sharing with Referral Partners and/or opt-out of Prosper affiliate information sharing, you may sign into your[Prosper Account](https://www.prosper.com/signin), select “Settings” from the drop down menu, and disable “Optional Information Sharing” in the section titled “Communication Preferences.” You may also contact us at [privacy@prosper.com](mailto:privacy@prosper.com) and we will assist you in disabling such information sharing**.

If you would like to exercise your right to opt-out of information sharing by a company affiliated with Prosper but not covered by this policy, you must consult that company’s privacy policy for instructions on how to exercise your right to opt-out of their information sharing.

**ADDITIONAL FACTS ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**How you can change your personal information**

If you have an account, you can access the personal information you have provided to us by logging in to the “Settings” page of your account.  As a registered investor, you can update your password, email, phone number, or home address at any time.  As a registered borrower, you may update your password, email, phone number, bank account information or mailing address at any time, though certain changes prior to loan origination may require you to submit a new loan application. To change your information, you may also contact us at [support@prosper.com](mailto:support@prosper.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.

We will retain your information for a minimum of seven years and as long as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, conduct analysis, audits, or to enforce our agreements or as otherwise required by law.

**How Prosper Secures Your Information**

Prosper uses significant safeguards, including physical, technical (electronic), and operational controls to protect your personal information, both during transmission and once received. If you have any questions about the security of your information, you can contact us at [privacy@prosper.com](mailto:privacy@prosper.com).

Prosper equips all servers with an Extended Validation (EV) Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate to ensure that when you connect to our websites you can tell that you are actually on our site and that all data entered into the websites are transmitted to us in a secure encrypted channel. Once on our system, personal information can only be read or written through defined service access points, the use of which is password-protected. Data security is achieved through technical safeguards that include a combination of encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection system, malware detection system, and data loss prevention systems. Prosper also conducts vulnerability scans of applications and systems regularly.

Access to the system is tightly controlled and limited to only those who have a need to access information. Administrative safeguards such as a security awareness program, background checks, and internal information use policy ensure that only trained and trusted staff are permitted to access personal information. Some additional features of our security program include:

**_Secure Data Center_**

We store all sensitive financial information in state-of-the-art, highly secure data centers that are audited per SSAE 16 Type II and/or SOC 2 Type II standards. Physical access to the data centers is strictly controlled and we use the latest threat prevention technologies such as network and web application firewalls, VPN, antivirus, Web filtering and antispam technologies.

**_Session Time-Outs_**

We employ session time-outs to protect your account or application. You will be logged out of the site automatically after a specified period of inactivity. This time-out feature reduces the risk of others being able to access your account or information if you leave your computer unattended.

**_Passwords_**

If you have an account, at a minimum, we require the use of both numbers and letters in your password. We have also instituted secure steps by which you can regain access to your account should you forget your password. You should always choose a password that is difficult for others to guess and change your password frequently.

**Additional Steps You Should Take to Ensure the Security of Your Information**

Prosper sends important communications regarding your account or application via email. You should therefore take steps to secure and restrict access to your email account and change your email account password frequently. You should also be aware of fraudulent emails known as “phishing,” from companies claiming to be Prosper and requesting your login information or other account information. Prosper will never ask for your login information in an email.

When you are finished using our site, you should log out completely, then close the browser window and clear the browser’s cache files and saved passwords.  This step is particularly important if you use a computer that is accessed by other people, such as in a public library or Internet café.

**Changes to this policy**

Any updates to the privacy policy become effective when posted on the websites. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by providing the revised privacy policy in your account on www.prosper.com. Your continued use of our services following the update means that you accept Prosper’s updated privacy policy.
