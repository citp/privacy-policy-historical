_**EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Policy**_

We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Privacy Shield Principles”) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States (the “EU Personal Data”). We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. If there is any conflict between the terms in our Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. 

_Personal Data Collection and Use_

This Privacy Policy describes the categories of Personal Information that we collect, which includes the EU Personal Data that we may receive in the U.S., as well as the purposes for which we use such EU Personal Data.

_Third-Party Agents or Service Providers_

We may transfer EU Personal Data to our third-party contractors, affiliated organizations or other service providers who perform functions on our behalf as described in this Privacy Policy. Where required by the Privacy Shield Principles, we enter into written agreements with those third-party contractors, affiliated organizations and other service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection the Privacy Shield Principles require and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party contractors, affiliated organizations and other service providers process EU Personal Data in accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party contractors, affiliated organizations or other service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of EU Personal Data that we transfer to them.

_Disclosures for National Security or Law Enforcement_

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose EU Personal Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

_Access Rights_

You may have the right to access the EU Personal Data that we hold about you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your EU Personal Data, you can submit a written request to our contact provided below. We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information.

_Questions or Complaints_

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolving complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Private Shield policy should first contact us at info@productplan.com.

We have further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (“DPAs”) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction within 45 days after our receipt of your complaint, you may contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.

_Binding Arbitration_

You may have the option to select binding arbitration for the resolution of your complaint under certain circumstances, provided you have taken the following steps: (a) raised your compliant directly with us and provided us the opportunity to resolve the issue, (b) made use of the independent dispute resolution mechanism identified above, and (c) raised the issue through the relevant data protection authority and allowed the U.S. Department of Commerce an opportunity to resolve the complaint at no cost to you. For more information on binding arbitration, see the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield Framework: Annex I (Binding Arbitration).
