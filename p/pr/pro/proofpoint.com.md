We are not responsible for the personal data you choose to submit in these blogs. To request removal of your personal data from our blog, contact us at [privacy@proofpoint.com](mailto:privacy@proofpoint.com) .

We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as " ** _Personal Network Information_** "instead of Contact Information. "Log Data" does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled "Service Providers," "Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement" and "Business Transfers." We will use Log Data for any purpose.

**Aggregated Information**  
After stripping out any information that would personally identify you from within the set of Contact Information, Personal Network Information and Log Data we collect from you, we may combine that information with information we collect from other Proofpoint users and customers (collectively the " ** _Aggregated Information_** ") in order to improve the quality and value of Proofpoint Services and to analyze and understand how our Site is used.

**Cookies/Tracking Technologies**  
Technologies such as cookies or similar technologies are used by Proofpoint and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These are used in storing content information and preferences, analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited

**Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting**  
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

These Service Providers have access to your personal data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Principle 3 (Accountability for onward transfer) of the Privacy Shield requires Proofpoint to take certain steps when transferring personal data received from the European Union to third parties such as Service Providers (for example, by including mandatory contractual provisions within its contracts with those third parties).  Please note that Proofpoint, Inc. remains liable under the Principles if an agent processing personal data received from the European Union on its behalf processes that personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles (unless Proofpoint can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage). If you further are routed or otherwise make any web-browsing selection that takes you to another party's website you will be subject to the terms of such third party privacy policy for any activities that you conduct while on that third-party service.
