#### Information We Collect and Use

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our products and services, to provide quality customer service, to contact companies whose representative has indicated an interest in receiving information about Proofpoint products and to enable users to effectively navigate the Site.

We may collect your contact information in the following ways: if you sign up for a free 45 day trial, offers on the Site, newsletters, download white papers from the Site, respond to a promotion offered by a Proofpoint partner or send us an email. Such contact information includes first and last name, title, company name, industry type, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and company size (" ** _Contact Information_** "). We may also collect information about your mailbox size, which will allow us to classify your company by size. We may combine your Contact Information with information collected from others in order to improve the quality and value of our products and services, and to analyze and understand how our Site is used.

We also use your Contact Information to contact you with certain marketing or promotional materials, as well as other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at [privacy@proofpoint.com](mailto:privacy@proofpoint.com).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [privacy@proofpoint.com](mailto:privacy@proofpoint.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Blog** ****  
If you use the blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these blogs, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these blogs. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog, contact us at [privacy@proofpoint.com](mailto:privacy@proofpoint.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Customer Testimonials**  
We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

**Log Data**  
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect technical and statistical data about your visit, such as your browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data, the pages you visit and any search terms you use (" ** _Log Data_** "). We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as " ** _Personal Network Information_** "instead of Contact Information. "Log Data" does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled "Service Providers," "Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement" and "Business Transfers." We will use Log Data for any purpose.

**Aggregated Information**  
In addition, we may cull certain data from within the set of Contact Information, Personal Network Information and Log Data we collect from you and combine that information with information we collect from other Proofpoint users and customers (collectively the " ** _Aggregated Information_** ") in order to improve the quality and value of Proofpoint product offerings and to analyze and understand how our Site is used.

**Cookies/Tracking Technologies**  
Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Proofpoint and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited

  * Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting  
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by [**clicking here**](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union  [ **click here**](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) _)_. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Proofpoint cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas and notice of class certification), to protect the property and rights of Proofpoint or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

Proofpoint is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical, procedural, and technological measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Proofpoint transfers your Contact and Personal Network Information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
