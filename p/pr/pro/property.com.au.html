      REA is a subsidiary of REA Group Ltd and operates our websites on
      behalf of REA Group Ltd and its related companies ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>" and "<strong>us</strong>"
      in this Privacy Policy).

      including the National Privacy Principles, and any other applicable privacy laws in Australia.
      This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which personal information will be dealt with.</p> <p>There may be circumstances in which we need to transfer personal information outside Australia.
      If we do so, we strive to ensure that any organisation to which the information is
      transferred will be subject to binding privacy obligations.</p></section> <section><h1>Problems or Questions</h1> <p>If we become aware of any ongoing concerns or problems with our websites,

        that they can contact you directly about their offers, promotions, goods or services. If we do use your personal information in these ways,

      information being passed to the estate agent. What they then do with your information will be their responsibility.
      You will need to see the estate agent's privacy policy to find out how that estate agent handles your personal information.
      We are not responsible for the way estate agents collect, use, disclose or handle personal information.</p></section> <section><h1>Who do we disclose your information to?</h1> <p>We may disclose information held about you to the following types of organisations:</p> <ul class="linkList"><li>Estate agents and estate agencies.</li> <li>Third party suppliers who we have engaged to provide you with goods or services on our behalf,

          against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users or anyone
          else who could be harmed by such activities; or</li> <li>we believe, in good faith, that the law requires disclosure.</li></ul></ul> <p>We also disclose real estate agent contact details (which may include a profile photo)
      in association with listings or advertisements on our websites.</p></section> <section><h1>Storage, Security and Processing</h1> <p>We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our websites,
      and we review and update our security measures in light of current technologies.
      Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.</p> <p>However, we will endeavour to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information you may
      transmit to us or from our online products and services. Once we do receive your transmission,
      we will also use reasonable endeavours to ensure its security on our systems.</p> <p>In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems
      are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.
      However, we are not responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.</p> <p>Data (including personal data) submitted by REA's customers and visitors to our websites may be held on servers located in Australia

      and procedures to safeguard the secure storage and processing of data intra-group, has verified the security arrangements of its outsourced data
      processors and has implemented contractual arrangements intra-group and with its outsourced data processors in accordance with Privacy Act 1988.

      Cookies, which are industry standard and are used by most websites, including our websites, can facilitate a user's
      ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to customise our websites to your needs.</p> <p>All pages on our websites are coded with measurement software which is transparent to the user.
      The software makes use of an invisible image at
      the bottom of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique string.
      This enables them to count the number of unique browsers to our websites. This information is collected and aggregated,
      and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. We do not and will not marry any
      data collected with any personal
      information collected on our websites. We use the independent companies, including <a href="http://www.nielsen-online.com/">Nielsen/NetRatings</a> and <a href="http://www.omniture.com/">Omniture</a> to measure and analyse the Internet usage across our websites.</p> <p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure
      in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, you should note that
      cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features of our online services.</p></section> <section><h1>Links to Other Sites</h1> <p>We provide links to websites outside of our websites, as well as to third party websites. These linked sites are not
      under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our websites.
      Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of
      using that website and its privacy statement.</p></section> <section><h1>Credit applications by real estate agents</h1> <p>If you apply to us for credit, we will ask you to authorise us to obtain personal information about you
      from credit reporting agencies, other credit providers, existing or previous suppliers of goods or services,
      your bank and certain other businesses for the purposes of assessing your application.</p> <p>We will also require you to authorise us to disclose your personal information to:</p> <ul class="linkList"><li>credit reporting agencies (for the purpose of obtaining a credit report); and</li> <li>other credit providers, existing or previous suppliers of goods or services, your bank and certain other businesses
        (for the purposes of assessing your application).</li></ul> <p>In addition to the ways in which we may use personal information set out above,
