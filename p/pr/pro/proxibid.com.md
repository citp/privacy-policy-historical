Proxibid broadcasts the live auction over the Internet and allows Buyers to place bids in real time. Proxibid can also place automated bids on behalf of a Buyer unable to personally monitor the auction broadcast. Proxibid also provides timed online auctions services.

Sellers may or may not have their own privacy policies.

## USE OF INFORMATION

  * EXCEPT AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, WE DO NOT SELL, TRADE, RENT OR OTHERWISE DISCLOSE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD-PARTIES, UNLESS YOU EXPRESSLY GIVE US PERMISSION TO DO SO. HOWEVER, YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED WITH AFFILIATES, AGENTS, OR CONTRACTORS OF PROXIBID, AS NECESSARY, TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO YOU.


  * **Your personal information is used in the following ways:**
    * User IDs and Passwords - Provides you with access to your profile and to protected content;
    * Account Information - Provides us with information about who you are and how to contact you, along with any preferences you have provided, such as language, E-mail format and interests. Also, provides us with data for internal auditing and reporting;
    * AuctionGuard™ - Provides us with information needed to determine eligibility in specific auctions. AuctionGuard™ is Proxibid's proprietary software that relies on FastData® and Financial Transmission Network, Inc., as well as a Buyer's history within Proxibid's platform, to determine a Buyer's eligibility "score." Sellers may use this score to allow or to limit eligibility for certain auctions. Accordingly, a Buyer's AuctionGuard™ score may be disclosed to a Seller in connection with a Buyer's application to participate in the Seller's auction;
    * Customer Feedback and Support - Provides you with a mechanism for requesting information from Proxibid. Also, provides you with a mechanism to tell us how we can improve our services and site design;

  * **Cookies**
    * Our site places a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. "Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Our site uses cookies during your online session to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies allow us to avoid showing you the same ad or message repeatedly and allow us to tailor our site to you. Our cookies enable us to relate your use of our site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to our site. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.
  * **Public Forums**
    * Proxibid may provide its users with chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Please also note that Proxibid is not responsible for any content posted in these areas. Although Proxibid has the right to monitor all information disclosed in these areas, it is under no obligation to do so.
  * **Children's Privacy**
    * Proxibid understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive, on-line world. Proxibid does not intentionally target or solicit to children thirteen (13) or younger for purposes of collecting personal information. The Proxibid Web site may link to certain Web sites which may target or solicit to children thirteen (13) or younger and may collect personal information. Those Web sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but will (or should) have their own privacy policies that more fully explain how they respect and protect the privacy of children while providing them information, goods or services. Check out the [Federal Trade Commission's site](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm) for more tips on protecting children's privacy online.



## DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

We will only disclose your information to a third party when (i) the disclosure is consistent with this Privacy Policy; (ii) you otherwise expressly authorizes the disclosure; or (iii) we are ordered to disclose the information in a judicial or administrative proceeding and have provided written notice to you of such order (see "DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BY LAW" below).

**DISCLOSURE OF BUYER INFORMATION TO SELLERS**

  * Each Buyer expressly authorizes and directs Proxibid to deliver to the Seller any information Buyer has provided to us which is requested by the Seller in order for Buyer to participate in an auction. This may include any and all information listed above under "Information Collected by Proxibid." Buyer also authorizes us to disclose Buyer's AuctionGuard™ "score" to any Seller which requests such information to determine Buyer's eligibility to participate in an auction.
  * Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Proxibid has no responsibility whatsoever regarding the Seller's use of the information. Once we deliver Buyer's information to a Seller, the information will be governed by the Seller's privacy policy, if any. Proxibid has no control over and no obligation to monitor the Seller's use of Buyer information. Before a Buyer participates in any Seller's auction, Buyer should review that Seller's privacy policy, if any, to understand how Buyer's information will be handled.



**DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES**

  * Your information may be disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties in the following situations:
    * To vendors and service providers engaged by Proxibid to perform services or functions on behalf of Proxibid. Such third-parties shall be obligated to use your personally identifiable information solely in connection with providing such services;
      * To enforce our Unified User Agreement or otherwise protect our rights;
      * To resolve disputes between users;
      * We may disclose bidding and price information, auction item descriptions, and other auction data to third-parties
      * In connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, transfer, or exchange of all or a portion of Proxibid. As Proxibid continues to mature, it is possible that Proxibid or substantially all of its assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information will be one of the transferred business assets



**DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY LAW**

  * Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government under certain circumstances, or may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will remain private.



## EXTERNAL LINKS

  * Our site may contain links to other internet Web sites. We encourage all of our partners, contributors and third-parties to implement policies and practices that respect the privacy of our users. However, Proxibid is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are linked from the Proxibid Web site, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed to them. Because Proxibid does not control the privacy policies of third-parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We strongly suggest that you visit the privacy policy of those Web sites to learn about the collection and use of your personal information.



## RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

If Proxibid disposes of any personal information protected under this Privacy Policy, such disposal will be conducted in a secure manner in accordance with Proxibid?s data retention and disposal policy.

## SECURITY

  * Proxibid has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. We restrict access to your personal identification and contact information within the company to only those authorized employees who need to use that information for a specific job function.


  * Though Proxibid employs security measures designed to safeguard online transactions and personal information, we cannot be responsible if a third-party gains access to the database or your personal or credit card information by evading our security measures. If you become aware of any breach of data security or have any other questions regarding the security of our site, please contact us at [privacy@proxibid.com](mailto:privacy@proxibid.com).
