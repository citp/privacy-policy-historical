 **Uses and Disclosure of Information Collected**

WE will not release or use your personal information without your consent, except as specified in this Privacy Policy.

The information that you supply will be used to respond to your inquiries, to provide you with products and services, and to monitor transactions that you carry out with us. WE may authorize third party suppliers and service providers to use this information solely to assist us in providing our products and services.

WE may use your information to contact you about any new or updated products and services. WE may offer optional questionnaires, surveys and other information to you to assess and meet your interests and needs.

You will be able to "unsubscribe" to such information mailings and contacts at any time.

WE may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, and other third parties, but such information will not personally identify any individual.

If you terminate your account or deactivate specific services, WE will maintain some basic information about you in association with these services, including your name and address.

Upon any termination of your account, WE will also retain general information about you which does not identify you personally, but which may still be included with our aggregate information that is provided to third parties. Information that you provide to us can never be completely removed from databases due to technical constraints and the fact that WE back up our systems.

WE may disclose your information in special cases when WE have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, its users, or anyone else, WE may also disclose your information when WE believe in good faith that the law requires it.
