# Privacy Policy | The American Prospect

We respect the privacy of all individuals and our Privacy Policy is in place to help protect that privacy. This policy addresses activities from our servers. Other sites may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed or controlled by this policy.

**What Organization is Collecting the Information**  
_The American Prospect_ was founded in 1990 as an authoritative magazine of liberal ideas, committed to a just society, an enriched democracy, and effective liberal politics. Robert Kuttner, Robert Reich, and Paul Starr launched the magazine initially as a quarterly.

Since then, the /Prospect/ has grown into a magazine with a paid circulation of 55,000, a special in-depth report in most issues, and a daily Web magazine (www.prospect.org) with more than 300,000 monthly visitors.

**Personal Information**  
We do not collect any personal information about you when you visit our Web site (other than the standard information automatically collected and stored in the Web logs) unless you choose to provide it to us.

Specifically, we collect information when you send an e-mail to us, send us feedback, register for site access, subscribe to the print edition, make a donation, etc. When you e-mail a page, your e-mail addresses, and that of your recipient, are used only in the case of transmission errors. The information will not be used for any other purpose.

We use this information to help us make the site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
