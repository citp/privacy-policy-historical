Broadridge Web Site Privacy Statement. 

Broadridge operates this web site as an agent of your broker, bank, mutual fund or a corporation in which you own stock.  This statement sets forth Broadridge's Privacy Statement for this web site and describes the practices that Broadridge will follow with respect to the privacy of users of this site. By using this site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement.  From time to time, we may change this Privacy Statement. For example, as we update and improve our service, new features may require modifications to the Privacy Statement. Accordingly, please check back periodically. 

What personal information is collected? 

Broadridge collects the personal information that you provide to us.  The personal information collected at this site may include some or all of the following:  your e-mail address, voting instructions and personal identification number (pin). 

What are cookies and how are they used? 

This Broadridge site, like many other commercial websites, utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a website determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings of text that websites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing an Broadridge informational site, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site before. If you are a registered user of a site providing service to Broadridge clients (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using the site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize Broadridge services which require registration if you reject cookies.   

How is information collected, used, and disclosed? 

If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Statement. The personal information collected at this site is collected on behalf of the financial institution with which you have an account or the corporation in which you own registered shares, to enable Broadridge to provide the electronic voting service that you are electing to use.  We may provide this information directly to, or use this information at the direction of, such financial institution or corporation and they would direct the use of this information in accordance with their practices.  Broadridge treats the personally identifiable information that Broadridge collects as confidential and it is only used to carry out the services and activities described on this web site.  We do not sell or rent personal information collected through this site to anyone. Also, Broadridge may provide aggregate voting statistics or statistics relating to visits to our sites and enrollment in the electronic voting program, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Broadridge may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; or (c) enforce the Terms and Conditions of use. 

If in the future, your financial institution or a corporation in which you own stock makes other electronic services available, we may contact you by e-mail regarding the availability of such services. We may also contact you by e-mail in connection with this service, such as providing a confirmation of your voting instructions. 

How do we protect your information? 

We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers.  Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies.  We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate. 

How can you help protect your information? 

If you are using an Broadridge web site for which you registered and chose a password, PIN, user ID or other form of authentication, we recommend that you do not divulge this information to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. 

Other sites. 

Broadridge sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites.
