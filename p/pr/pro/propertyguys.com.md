PropertyGuys.com Privacy Policy  
Updated April 2006  
  


Your privacy is important to PropertyGuys.com. This policy is our guaranteed commitment to the protection of any personal information collected and how it is used and disclosed.

This Privacy Statement is intended to inform you about our practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that may be provided through provision of our services. By entering into contracts with us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (as defined below) in accordance with the following terms and conditions.

This Privacy Statement also explains how you can contact us if you have a question about, want to make a change to, or delete, any personal information we may be holding about you. We strongly recommend that you take the time to read this Privacy Statement and retain it for your future reference. 

  
  


For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, "personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. 

  
  


PropertyGuys.com collects personal information such as names, addresses, contact information, and specific homeowner and property details. Such information is provided to us by the customer and is used for the marketing of a property, the identification of a property for a potential buyer, or the promotion of our home marketing services or to third party advertisers such as mortgage brokers or real estate agents. 

  
  


PropertyGuys.com does not sell any information collected about our customers. PropertyGuys.com only discloses personal information on a strictly confidential basis. We use your Personal Information to: 

  1. Provide you with timely and reliable services and do all things necessary to administer those services; and 
  2. Develop and maintain our relationship with you and communicate with you. 

We disclose your personal information to our Head Office and or industry associates affiliated with our system to complete transactions or service requests initiated by you the customer. We disclose this information to our advertisers or affiliates, and receive the information back from them for the services we provide to them for invoicing purposes.

Additionally, we may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These other service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by us and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Statement.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties, such as those described above, as may be required to carry out the requested services. We disclose your personal information to such parties on an "as needed" basis only.

We reserve the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so. 

  
  


Each PropertyGuys.com franchisee maintains his or her own client information and is not an employee of PropertyGuys.com Inc. All PropertyGuys.com client files are kept physically at the office of each franchise location, at PropertyGuys.com Inc. Head Office, and electronically on PropertyGuys.com computer systems. We ensure that access or alteration to personal information is limited to those individuals who have a valid business reason to access the information. 

  
  


We collect personal information about you only when you voluntarily provide it. You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact our company's Privacy Officer, in the manner set out below. We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.

We will not, as a condition of the supply of our service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the purposes for which the information is being provided. 

  
  


You can help us maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us of any changes to this information. You may contact us in any one of the following ways set out below to request access to or correction or update of your personal information.
