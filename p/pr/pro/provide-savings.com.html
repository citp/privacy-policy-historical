<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

not available to the public, and may include information about your family as well as you personally. We
collect PII that you provide us through interaction with our website in order to provide you the service(s)
we offer. You are not obligated to provide us PII that we request, however, if you do not provide us with

For all insurance quote requests we collect personal contact information including name, telephone number,

</p>
<h3>Minors</h3>
<p>
Our website and services are not directed toward individuals who are under sixteen (16) years of age
("Minors") nor do we knowingly collect information from Minors.
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
A "cookie" is a test file that is placed in the browser files of your computer when you
visit a website. The cookie enables us to relate your use of our website to information that you
specifically and knowingly provided to us. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and
to provide content we believe would be of interest to you. Additionally we track usage statistics to
better understand how people interact with our site. Cookies do not collect personally identifiable
information; the information collected is in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. We do not link the
information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage
our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect
non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide
you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for
the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by
<a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">clicking here</a>.
Please note this does not opt you out of
being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
</p>
<p>
Our third party advertising partner uses clear gifs (web beacons), images and scripts. We do not tie
the information gathered to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>
By filling out information on our website as part of a request for information about insurance policies
and quotations, you authorize us to provide that information to various insurance companies, insurance
agents and other related third parties that participate in our insurance quote network (collectively
"Insurance Providers"). The Insurance Providers may provide your personal information to
their insurance carriers, suppliers and other related vendors in order to generate price quotations and
information relevant to insurance policies that you have requested, and the Insurance Providers may use
the information to contact you directly with quotations by means of telephone, fax, email and postal mail,
even if you have registered your phone number(s) on local and/or national no-call lists. You further
acknowledge and agree that each Insurance Provider that receives your quote request from this website or
from our affiliates may confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may include
among other things, your driving record and/or credit score. For purposes of faxing, it is understood
that Insurance Providers have an established business relationship with each user of this website, if
required to comply with the then current law.
</p>
<p>
We use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the Insurance Providers are obligated to protect your
PII to at least the degree established in this policy. Additionally, it is our policy to require Insurance
Providers to use commercially reasonable means to secure the receipt and processing of your PII.
</p>
<p>
You should be aware that after an Insurance Provider contacts you directly, any information you provide to
the Insurance Provider, which may be the same as or similar to the PII you submitted to us through this
website, will no longer be covered by this policy. In such cases, you should verify the individual Insurance
Provider's privacy policies and practices. We have no control over these Insurance Providers and their
practices and cannot and will not be responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for their respective
privacy policies and practices. Also be aware that the Insurance Providers may use the PII they acquire from
this website in connection with other information they acquire about you (from other sources that have
collected PII about you such as credit reporting companies, etc.) as well as information you provide them
directly. We cannot and will not be responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for any of the PII that
you provide directly to Insurance Providers after the Insurance Provider contacts you or that they acquire
from sources other than this website.
</p>
<p>
We may also share your PII with the following types of entities and/or under the following circumstances:
</p>
<p>
Third parties with whom we have promotional or advertising relationships (provided that we are not otherwise
restricted from this sharing of information). If you do not want us to share your personal information with
these companies, contact us at compliance@adharmonics.com.
</p>
<h3>If we obtained your information from public sources.</h3>
<p>
There is no way for you to access or update your information once a request is submitted. If you make a
mistake in a request, you can re-submit your information in full. We do not directly contact you through
email or telephone. If you no longer want to receive correspondence regarding insurance quotes, you need
to take action directly by contacting the respective Insurance Provider(s) that contact you and ask them
to no longer contact you. We will not sell, rent or disclose your PII to third parties for purposes of
their own marketing campaigns except as authorized in this policy.
</p>
<p>
We may provide your PII to, or permit access to it by, our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, vendors
and/or service providers, such as our ISP or infrastructure hosting companies, for the purpose of
processing such information on our behalf, or where such access is incidental to their providing
assistance to us. In such cases, we expect these parties to process such information based on our
instructions and in compliance with this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is
necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a court order, legal process or judicial proceeding
served on us.
</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may
[correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it] by emailing our Customer Support at
compliance@adharmonics.com or by contacting us by postal mail at provide-savings.com
, 955 Massachusetts Ave. #323, Cambridge, MA 02139.
</p>
<h3>Data Rentention</h3>
<p>
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to
provide you services contact us at compliance@adharmonics.com. We will retain and use your information
as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information
(such as health history) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using
secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at
compliance@adharmonics.com.
</p>

may link to or view as part of a frame on a page on this website. These other sites may place their
own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personally identifiable
information from you. We are not responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for the actions or
policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third
parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party. You should always
be careful in how you use and share any sensitive personal information with any third party.
</p>
