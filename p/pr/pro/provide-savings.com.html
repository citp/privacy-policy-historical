</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
  A "cookie" is a test file that is placed in the browser files of your computer when you
  visit a website. The cookie enables us to relate your use of our website to information that you
  specifically and knowingly provided to us. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and
  to provide content we believe would be of interest to you. Additionally we track usage statistics to
  better understand how people interact with our site. Cookies do not collect personally identifiable
  information; the information collected is in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. We do not link the
  information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
  We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage
  our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect
  non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide
  you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for
  the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by
  <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">clicking here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of
  being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
</p>

<p>
  Our third party advertising partner uses clear gifs (web beacons), images and scripts. We do not tie
  the information gathered to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>

<h3>Use of Information</h3>

<p>
  By filling out information on our website as part of a request for information about insurance policies
  and quotations, you authorize us to provide that information to various insurance companies, insurance
  agents and other related third parties that participate in our insurance quote network (collectively
  "Insurance Providers"). The Insurance Providers may provide your personal information to
  their insurance carriers, suppliers and other related vendors in order to generate price quotations and
  information relevant to insurance policies that you have requested, and the Insurance Providers may use
  the information to contact you directly with quotations by means of telephone, fax, email and postal mail,
  even if you have registered your phone number(s) on local and/or national no-call lists. You further
  acknowledge and agree that each Insurance Provider that receives your quote request from this website or
  from our affiliates may confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may include
  among other things, your driving record and/or credit score. For purposes of faxing, it is understood
  that Insurance Providers have an established business relationship with each user of this website, if
  required to comply with the then current law.
</p>

<p>
  We use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the Insurance Providers are obligated to protect your
  PII to at least the degree established in this policy. Additionally, it is our policy to require Insurance
  Providers to use commercially reasonable means to secure the receipt and processing of your PII.
</p>

<p>
  You should be aware that after an Insurance Provider contacts you directly, any information you provide to
  the Insurance Provider, which may be the same as or similar to the PII you submitted to us through this
  website, will no longer be covered by this policy. In such cases, you should verify the individual Insurance
  Provider's privacy policies and practices. We have no control over these Insurance Providers and their
  practices and cannot and will not be responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for their respective
  privacy policies and practices. Also be aware that the Insurance Providers may use the PII they acquire from
  this website in connection with other information they acquire about you (from other sources that have
  collected PII about you such as credit reporting companies, etc.) as well as information you provide them
  directly. We cannot and will not be responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for any of the PII that
  you provide directly to Insurance Providers after the Insurance Provider contacts you or that they acquire
  from sources other than this website.
</p>

<p>
  We may also share your PII with the following types of entities and/or under the following circumstances:
</p>

<p>
  Third parties with whom we have promotional or advertising relationships (provided that we are not otherwise
  restricted from this sharing of information). If you do not want us to share your personal information with
  these companies, contact us at compliance@adharmonics.com.
</p>

<h3>If we obtained your information from public sources.</h3>

<p>
  There is no way for you to access or update your information once a request is submitted. If you make a
  mistake in a request, you can re-submit your information in full. We do not directly contact you through
  email or telephone. If you no longer want to receive correspondence regarding insurance quotes, you need
  to take action directly by contacting the respective Insurance Provider(s) that contact you and ask them
  to no longer contact you. We will not sell, rent or disclose your PII to third parties for purposes of
  their own marketing campaigns except as authorized in this policy.
</p>

<p>
  We may provide your PII to, or permit access to it by, our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, vendors
  and/or service providers, such as our ISP or infrastructure hosting companies, for the purpose of
  processing such information on our behalf, or where such access is incidental to their providing
  assistance to us. In such cases, we expect these parties to process such information based on our
  instructions and in compliance with this privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is
  necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a court order, legal process or judicial proceeding
  served on us.
</p>

<h3>Access</h3>

<p>
  If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may
  [correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it] by emailing our Customer Support at
  compliance@adharmonics.com or by contacting us by postal mail at provide-savings.com
  , PO Box 425768, Cambridge, MA.
</p>

<h3>Data Rentention</h3>

<p>
  We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
  services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to
  provide you services contact us at compliance@adharmonics.com. We will retain and use your information
  as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
  The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information
  (such as health history) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using
  secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>

<p>
  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
  during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
  of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at
  compliance@adharmonics.com.

  provide-savings.com. We do not exercise control over the websites of third parties that you
  may link to or view as part of a frame on a page on this website. These other sites may place their
  own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personally identifiable
  information from you. We are not responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for the actions or
  policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third
  parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party. You should always
  be careful in how you use and share any sensitive personal information with any third party.
</p>

<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
