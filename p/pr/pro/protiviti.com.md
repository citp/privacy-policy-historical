#### **EU-U.S. and SWISS-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Participation for European Client Engagement Data**

Protiviti Inc. in the U.S. (the "Protiviti US") participates in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (the "Frameworks"). Protiviti US’s participation in the Frameworks applies to personal data received in the U.S. from the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland (“Swiss”) about our corporate clients' personnel, customers and vendors (collectively, "European Client Engagement Data"). We are committed to subjecting such European Client Engagement Data to the Frameworks, including its Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability to the extent applicable to Protiviti US as a processor acting on behalf of our corporate clients. To learn more about the Frameworks, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

#### **European Client Engagement Data Collection, Use, and Disclosure**

We operate as a processor acting on behalf of our corporate clients regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of European Client Engagement Data and we process European Client Engagement Data that our corporate clients submit to our services in accordance with their instructions. If you are an employee at, or customer or vendor of, our corporate clients, please consult the privacy policies of that entity for information about its privacy practices.

#### **Rights of EU and Swiss Data Subjects under the Frameworks**

If you are an EU or Swiss data subject, you have the right to access your own European Client Engagement Data subject to certain limitations, such as where the legitimate rights of other persons would be infringed or where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate.  Please note that because Protiviti US personnel may have limited ability to access European Client Engagement Data our clients provide to us as part of our services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please contact us as described below and provide the name of the corporate client who submitted your data to us. We will refer your request to that corporate client, and will support them as needed in responding to your request.

#### **Choices of EU and Swiss Data Subjects**

We operate as a processor acting on behalf of our corporate clients and, as such, do not use or disclose European Client Engagement Data in a manner that is subject to choice requirements under the Frameworks.

#### **Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability under the Frameworks**

In compliance with the Frameworks, Protiviti commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of European Client Engagement Data. Individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Frameworks policy should first contact us as specified below. In addition, please contact us as specified below if you have any questions, need access to your European Client Engagement Data, or otherwise need assistance. We remain responsible for our collection, use and disclosure of European Client Engagement Data in accordance with the Frameworks. We also are responsible for third party agents that are processing European Client Engagement Data on our behalf, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose European Client Engagement Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved concern about European Client Engagement Data that we have not addressed satisfactorily, we have committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) to serve as our independent dispute resolution bodies for the Frameworks. We are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to the Frameworks. In addition, under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website (available [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome)), EU and Swiss residents may invoke binding arbitration for non-monetary issues when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
