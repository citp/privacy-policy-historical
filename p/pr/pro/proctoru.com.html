<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<h4>Information Collected Upon Registration</h4>
<p>When you create or reconfigure a ProctorU account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, the institution with which you will be taking an exam, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and the assessment you are scheduled to take, is listed internally in our system and is accessible by your institution. Your use of the service may also result in ProctorU having a stored image of your face, a stored image of the work you perform while connected to ProctorU, or a video capture of your activities while connected with ProctorU. This information is used to verify to your institution that you were the person performing the work and that the work was performed properly.</p>
<h4>Acxiom Authentication</h4>
<p> You may be asked to authenticate your identity through data services powered by Acxiom. For all privacy policies regarding Acxiom Authentication, please see <a href="http://www.acxiom.com/about_us/privacy/" target="_blank">http://acxiom.com/about-acxiom/privacy/</a></p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services.

ProctorU may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services.

<h4>Service Providers</h4>

We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p>
<h4>Law and Harm</h4>
<p> We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect ProctorU's rights or property.</p>
<h4>Business Transfers</h4><p>In the event that ProctorU is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
