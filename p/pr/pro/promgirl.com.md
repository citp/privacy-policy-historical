****What personal information is collected and how is it used?**  
Personal information is considered any information that is specific to you, such as your name, email address, credit card information, etc. In order to make a purchase or receive PromGirl’s newsletter, users must enter their personal information.

When you make a purchase, we require that you provide your shipping and billing address, phone number and credit card information (if paying by credit card). This information is stored in a secure database, only accessible to select employees with access rights to this information. PromGirl.com protects your online order information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. (Details are provided in the next section.)

Additionally, PromGirl.com logs your Internet Protocol Address (IP). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when browsing the Internet. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any PII, meaning that your session on our site is tracked, but will not be linked to any personal information.

**  
How secure is my personal information?**  
Your information is secure with PromGirl.com! Protecting your order information is a priority. Promgirl.com uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to insure that all data passed between our server and your web browser remain private and secure.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than PromGirl.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), this means the SSL is active. You can also double check by looking at your browsers URL. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".

Some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In this case, you will not be able to connect to the secure server and must disable your firewall or choose a different method to order. 

If you cannot access our secure server for any reason, please feel free to use our offline order form available upon check out, or place your order by phone. See our [ordering page](http://www.promgirl.com/info/orders) for more information.
