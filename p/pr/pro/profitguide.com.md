Advertisers who use direct mail may ask Rogers Publishing to be able to send through the mail material of interest to subscribers of some of our publications, but in such cases the list is only released to a reputable third party service bureau for the purpose of sending the specific mailing. E-mail lists might be used for similar communications. All such advertising material is reviewed and subject to approval for acceptable advertising content.  
If you would prefer that you name not be provided to marketers outside of Rogers, please inform us. (see "[Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20111231223149id_/http://www.rogerspublishing.ca/portfolio/privacy.htm#Contact)" below)

But if you prefer otherwise, we provide clear, easy ways for you to tell us so. These are your personal marketing preferences.

_**Does Rogers Media use telemarketing to sell magazine subscriptions?**_  
Yes, we have found it convenient for some consumers to contact them by phone either to start new subscriptions or to renew an existing subscription. The authorized agents who sell new subscriptions are required to make use of the national "Do Not Call" registry so that they do not call the phone numbers of people who have registered. You can get more information about the "Do Not Call" registry here <http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/INFO_SHT/t1031.htm>. For telemarketing related to the renewals of existing subscriptions, you can update your contact preferences by logging in to your subscriber service page which can be found here.   
For consumer magazines: [http://www.rogerspublishing.ca/read_sub/CPG.shtml](https://web.archive.org/web/20111231223149id_/http://www.rogerspublishing.ca/read_sub/CPG.shtml)[

_**What if I use Rogers Cable or Wireless services?**_  
You should go to the customer care section of the Rogers web site at [  
http://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal](http://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal)  
Back to top

**_Are there other ways my information will be used?_**  
In addition to the cases above, Rogers may use your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, under circumstances specifically described to you when we collect the information (such as in a Terms of Service or Use agreement), or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.   
Back to top

_**What about personalized ads in magazines?**_  
Occasionally an advertiser may ask that we print the name of subscribers in their advertisement in our publications. When this is done, the subscriber's name is printed on the ad at the same time that the mailing label is printed on the cover of the magazine, and the subscriber's name appears only in their personal copy of the magazine. If you would prefer not have your name included in such advertisements, please contact us at Magazine Subscriber Service and specify 'Do Not Personalize'.

Please note ‘Do Not Personalize’ is not applicable to business magazines.  
Back to top

_**Does Rogers protect the privacy of children?**_  
The privacy of children is important to us. We will not knowingly send direct mailings, e-mail or other correspondence to anyone who indicates that they are younger than 16 years. Your children should always ask you for permission before sending personal information to Rogers Communications Inc., or to anyone else. Any personal information we gather from children under the age of 16 would be used solely for demographic purposes.

A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser's files for our reference. No one else can read this file. Cookies allow our server computer to recognize you when you return to our sites, so you don't have to re-register and so we can retain any preferences you may have given us.

**_Do Rogers websites record information about my computer or my visit?_**  
Rogers collects IP addresses and related information for the purposes of system administration and to create aggregate statistical reports for advertisers. This information cannot identify you personally.

Browser information (i.e. the URL of the web page you were just on, the IP address of the computer you are using, your domain type, and your browser version) is automatically recorded as part of transmitting information over the Internet. We may use it to help us display information in the best format for you. 

We may develop summary reports for advertisers, to help them better understand our audience and provide advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you. For example, we may report total number of visitors to our site in general or to specific pages, average length of visit, etc. No identifying data about individuals is reported.   
During your visit to our sites, we may record choices you have made and use this to provide more customized content or advertising. The data does not identify you and is not retained after your visit. This is sometimes called "clickstream" data.  
Back to top

**_Does Rogers use "third party advertising"?_**  
The ads appearing on many of the Rogers Media Web sites are delivered to you using online advertising networks. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad or visits to certain pages of Rogers Media web sites (but not your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information) is used to serve ads to you. The ad network providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements served to you on Rogers Media web sites or through affiliate advertising network providers. Web beacons utilize JavaScript code and write information to cookies, which are small files on your computers.  If you do not want a cookie to be written, simply change the setting in your browser.  For more information and how to "opt-out" from DoubleClick cookies, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy). For more information on how to opt-out from other ad network providers’ cookies, please [click here](http://www.jellycloud.com/optout_landing.html).

**_What about information on public forums?_**  
Rogers sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  
Back to top

**_What steps do you take for the security of my information?_**   
Our sites use industry-standard security measures to protect data against loss, misuse and interception by third parties. Our security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. However, Rogers assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the Internet.  
Back to top

_**How else can I protect my privacy online?**_  
Generally speaking, whenever you disclose personal information online there is a risk that the information may be intercepted, collected and used. That goes for information disclosed on message boards, in chat areas - or even in e-mail. Rogers is not responsible if that information is intercepted. You transmit information to anyone at your own risk. 

Co-branded sites and third party Internet sites and services may be accessible through Rogers sites. Third parties may collect information for their own contests or promotions, and may have their own privacy and data collection practices. Rogers is not responsible for and bears no liability for these policies or actions. 

You alone are responsible for keeping passwords and information safe. Be careful and responsible whenever you're online.  
Back to top

**_What happens to information I provide on a contest entry?_**  
Rogers uses a variety of contests and similar promotions to increase awareness of our products and services. We generally request contact information so that we can notify you if you are a prize winner. As well, in some cases we may contact contest entrants with product information. Contest entries generally include a way for you to indicate that you do not want to be contacted based on the information on your entry. Because contests may involve co-sponsors outside Rogers who have their own privacy practices, it is always advisable to read the entry form and contest rules before entering.
