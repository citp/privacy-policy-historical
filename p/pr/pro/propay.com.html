<b>PROPAY'S PRIVACY POLICY OUTLINED</b><br><br>
<b>Required Information</b><br>

In order to use ProPay's services, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, ProPay requires name, e-mail address, mailing address, day and evening phone, social security number, date of birth and the creation of a unique password. Contact information is used only to identify you and ensure fraud protection and security. Unique identifier information is used to qualify for and set up a ProPay account. Credit card and checking account information is required to use specific services of ProPay and is used only to process those transactions you have initiated. <br><br>

<b>Disclosure of Information</b><br>

ProPay will protect the personal information that you share.  Contact and demographic information is not shared with third parties without your prior permission.  If you make a transaction that requires credit card and checking account information, ProPay uses that information only to process your payment request and will not use it for marketing purposes.  When required, ProPay may also disclose information to regulatory agencies, including the Visa and MasterCard Association.<br><br>

ProPay may disclose personal information when required by law or in good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on ProPay's website.  <br><br>

<b>Security</b><br>

ProPay's website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.<br><br>
 
When the registration form or transaction forms ask you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, checking account information, and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected. While on a secure page, such as the registration form or transaction forms, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about ProPay's security, follow this link: <a class="text" href="https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/457816c883e66e8befe76255407ad5d0">https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/457816c883e66e8befe76255407ad5d0</a><br><br>  

While ProPay uses VeriSign encryption to protect sensitive information transferred online, they also do everything in their power to protect your information offline. All your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in ProPay's offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (ProPay's database administrator and customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on ProPay's security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, ProPay's employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of privacy, and what they can do to ensure ProPay's customers' information is protected. The servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. <br><br>

If you have any questions about the security at ProPay's website, please e-mail <a class="text" href="mailto:webmaster@propay.com">webmaster@propay.com</a>.<br><br>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
ProPay's website uses cookies only to track referrals from their affiliates who have joined an affiliate program and to identify a user when they return to the website.<br><br>

<b>Links</b><br>
ProPay's website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that ProPay is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. ProPay encourages you to be aware when you leave the ProPay website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.<br><br>

<b>Email Links</b><br>
ProPay uses e-mail links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact them directly with any questions or comments. ProPay reads every message sent in and tries to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. ProPay may also file your comments to improve the website and program, or they may review and discard the information. <br><br>

<b>Referral Program</b><br>
If you elect to use the ProPay referral service for informing a friend about ProPay, ProPay will ask you for the friend's name and e-mail address. ProPay will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the website and register for the service. ProPay stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. <br><br>

<b>Newsletter and Promotions</b> <br>
ProPay sends all new members a welcoming e-mail. Established members will receive information on special promotions and a newsletter, including product and service updates. Out of respect for your privacy, ProPay presents the option to not receive these types of communications. Please refer to the "Opting Out" section below.<br><br>

ProPay may occasionally present a special promotion. To qualify for entry, ProPay may ask you to provide personal information. If ProPay plans to share that information with any sponsor(s), they will provide a statement to that effect. 
 <br><br>

<b>Opting Out</b><br>
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving further information from ProPay about special promotions or product updates. The  registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so you can choose whether you want marketing material or product updates. <br><br>

If you no longer wish to receive service updates or promotional materials from ProPay, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by e-mailing  <a class="text" href="mailto:customerservice@propay.com">customerservice@propay.com</a>.  <br><br>

<b>Surveys</b> <br>
From time-to-time ProPay may request information from you via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of ProPay's service and/or this website.<br><br>

<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If ProPay decides to change their privacy policy, they will post a notification of these changes on the Homepage so you are always aware of what information they collect, how they use it, and under circumstances, if any, they disclose it. If at any point ProPay decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, they will notify you by way of an e-mail.<br><br>

<b>How to Update Your Personal Information</b><br>
You can help ProPay maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying them or updating your personal profile when you change your address, mailing address, phone numbers, or e-mail address. If at any time you wish to update your information contact ProPay by e-mail at <a class="text" href="mailto:customerservice@propay.com">customerservice@propay.com</a> or by postal mail at: <br><br>

ProPay USA Inc.<br>
500 Timpanogos Parkway<br>
Orem, UT 84097 <br><br>

Please include your old and new contact information so that ProPay can make the appropriate corrections.
