# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy: Provident Living.org**

Provident Living.org is a Web site of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (“Church”). We are very sensitive to the privacy of Internet users who visit this site and our affiliated sites, LDS Family Services.org and ItsAboutLove.org. Therefore, we endeavor to provide users all information regarding our identity, how we use personal information that is collected, how to contact us, and how they can access and update their personal information. We also inform users of all potential recipients of the personal information. We do not use any personal information for purposes beyond those stated herein. 

**Our Identity and How to Contact Us**

These sites are owned and operated by Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Users can contact us by linking to the Feedback page and leaving a message detailing any questions or concerns. 

**Personal Information: Collection and Use**

**Provident Living.org** collects information from users only on a voluntary basis in the following categories and never discloses the information except as provided herein: name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, ward and stake. Information is provided voluntarily by users and is used by the Church only to the extent necessary to provide employment assistance through the Church’s Employment Resource Services Database (ERSDB). The information collected is used strictly to facilitate users' requests or to respond to a query. We regard this information as confidential and do not use it for any other purpose, sell it to other parties, or disclose it to any third party without your express permission. Users can correct their personal information by contacting an employment specialist at an employment center or at the ward or stake. If any problems are encountered in removing, modifying, or updating personal information, users can contact us at the [Feedback](http://www.lds.org/feedback/1,5403,114,00.html) page and request assistance. 

**Site Activities: Collection and Use of Other Data**

The Church has contracted with a third-party service provider to help track and analyze usage and volume statistics on these sites. The third-party service provider does not collect personal information from site visitors, only general summaries of site activities. This information is used only to improve site quality. This third-party service uses cookies and clear gifs (as explained below), neither of which contain personally identifiable information, to help in tracking and analyzing site usage information. 

_**Cookies and Clear Gifs.**_ In our effort to improve users’ site experience, these sites use cookies and clear gifs to provide pages and features that are most compatible with users’ preferences. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a browser when a user visits a Web site. A clear gif is a graphic file, rather than a text file, that is similar in function to a cookie. Cookies and clear gifs do not identify the user personally; they simply identify the browser and track the settings, preferences, or features. When a user returns to the site, the user’s browser sends the cookie or clear gif to the Church’s Web server and/or the third party’s server. 

_**Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses.**_ When users request pages from Provident Living.org, LDS Family Services.org, or ItsAboutLove.org, our servers may log their IP address in order to improve site administration. This information, along with the other information listed above, can also be used to produce usage statistics to help us to better meet the needs of users and determine specific interests. 

**Protecting Information**

These sites are equipped with security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. We cannot guarantee that the information will not be lost or misused, but we make every effort to ensure that it is secured to avoid such problems. 

**Foreign Transfer of Data**

These sites are designed for use by U.S. residents. If you are not a U.S. resident, you can use these sites, but you are responsible for making sure that your actions comply with the laws in your area. When you submit information through these Web sites, we understand that your action is an affirmative act, indicating informed consent to the processing as well as informed consent to allow the transborder transfer of the data to the U.S. for the purposes outlined above. If you submit any personal information about yourself or others, including information inferring or demonstrating religious beliefs, affiliations, or practices, you alone are responsible for the consequences of making this transfer of personal information. 

**Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. We recommend that minor children obtain permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves or others. 

**Third-Party Links**

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third-party sites. For your own protection, you should review the policies of similar sites to ensure they meet your personal expectations of privacy. 

**Future Changes to Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Privacy Policy at any time. As we do not typically use personal information except as provided for above, we are not in a position to notify each user of material changes in our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check the Privacy Policy to remain informed of any changes. 

**Additional Data Privacy Information**

In addition to the [Feedback](http://www.lds.org/feedback/1,5403,114,00.html) links above, enquiries concerning this Privacy Policy or the security of personal information processed by the Church may be sent via email to: [DataPrivacyOfficer@ldschurch.org.](mailto:DataPrivacyOfficer@ldschurch.org)

**Effective Date**

This version of the Privacy Policy became effective on the 8th day of March, 2005.
