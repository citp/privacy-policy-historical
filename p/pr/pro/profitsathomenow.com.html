			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p></p><p>Last Updated: November 8, 2010</p>

      <p>PDFDocSpace.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of 
        Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. 
        We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, 
        street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy 
        policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any 
        unauthorized third party. Period.'</p>

      <p>How we gather information from users</p>

      <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 

        the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. 

        For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 

        for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, 

        such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information 

        when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat 

        rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, PDFDocSpace..com 

        also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic 

        tools that may be transparent to our visitors. </p>

      <p>For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or 

        use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your 

        visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 

        sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, 

        or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 

        while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 

        gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 

        not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser 

        to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 

        certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 

        and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features 

        according to your preferences.</p>

      <p>What we do with the information we collect</p>

      <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit 
        and deliver more individualized content and advertising. </p>

      <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on PDFDocSpace..com 
        to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; 
        our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered 
        by PDFDocSpace..com and other topics we think you may find of interest. 
      </p>

      <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by PDFDocSpace..com may 
        also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
        troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration 
        of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you by us or 
        other parties who we may from time to time share your information with. 
        Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation 
        of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. 
        We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from 
        time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
        merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
        user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose 
        your information in response to a court order, at other times when we 
        believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with 
        the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
        authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note 
        we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
      <p>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>

      <p>PDFDocSpace..com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates 

        to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 

        including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 

        accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 

        policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you 

        may link to, or view as part of a frame on a PDFDocSpace..com 

        page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. 

        Also, through PDFDocSpace..com you may be introduced to, or 

        be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes 

        offered by other parties. PDFDocSpace..com is not responsible 

        for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the 

        applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information 

        on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>

      <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 

        parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some 

        of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some 

        of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies 

        that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 

        advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services 

        operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather 

        information. PDFDocSpace..com does not control the use of this 

        technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible 

        for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>

      <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 

        Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information 

        can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties 

        without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other 

        individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of 

        PDFDocSpace..com and this policy.</p>

      <p>Children</p>

      <p>PDFDocSpace..com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally 

        Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted 

        by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 

        13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. 

        If you believe PDFDocSpace..com has any information from or 

        about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

     

      <p>Changes to this Policy</p>

      <p>PDFDocSpace..com reserves the right to change this policy at 

        any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued 

        use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean 

        you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any 

        change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied 

        at the time the information was collected.</p>

      <p>Governing law</p>

      <p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by New York law. If 

        a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it 

        with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: 

        Rochester. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with 

        the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>

      <p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution 

        through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration 

        at the following location: Rochester, under the rules of the American 

        Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration 

        may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
