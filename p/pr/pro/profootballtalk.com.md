As is always the case, information collected and used by these Companies will not be tied to a user’s personal information and will only be used in the aggregate. If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, currently you may visit each ad network’s web site individually and opt-out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network-advertising cookies.
