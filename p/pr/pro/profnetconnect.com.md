# ProfNet Connect

PR Newswire Association LLC (“PR Newswire” or “we”) is a global leader in news and information distribution services for professional communicators. Two of our services, [ProfNet](http://www.prnewswire.com/products-services/targeting-monitoring-measurement/media-placement-opportunities-expert-database/) and PR Newswire for Journalists (“[PRNJ](http://media.prnewswire.com/en/jsp/myPRNJ.jsp)”), give journalists access to news releases, expert resources, and PR professionals. We now offer ProfNet Connect (“Connect”), [www.profnetconnect.com](http://www.profnetconnect.com/), a social media website to give those same professionals -- journalists, experts and PR professionals -- more ways to connect and communicate directly with each other.

  * How information about you from the Connect community is linked to our ProfNet and PRNJ services. 
  * Our privacy practices for this website in particular. 
  * The controls you have over sharing information with people who register as part of the Connect community, on the home page and in PRNJ.



Our primary [PR Newswire Privacy Policy](http://prnewswire.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=62) continues in effect as you access [www.prnewswire.com](http://www.prnewswire.com/), including ProfNet and PRNJ, and other websites indicated in that Policy. Copies of information about you collected on this website but published in the ProfNet and PRNJ services, as explained below, will be governed by that Policy.

### How the Connect Community is linked to ProfNet and PRNJ

Your profile information from www.profnetconnect.com may also be available in PRNJ and ProfNet but only as follows: 

  * If you are an expert or a PR professional, your profile information in ProfNet and in this community remains separate but linked: Your profile information from ProfNet will be used to register you automatically in the Connect community unless you tell us not to do so. Any updated profile information you give us for either ProfNet or the Connect community will be used to update your profile for the other. 
  * If you are listed as a journalist in either PRNJ or in ProfNet, you must register separately to participate in this community. Information you provide here will not be linked with information we have about you in either of those two services. Once you choose to register for the Connect community and as you use this website, your identity will be disclosed under this website’s privacy settings and practices. 
  * Members of the Connect community will be also searchable from PRNJ and from Internet search engines. You may block or control access to your profile from that search by using the **Privacy Settings** as described below.



### Information We Collect About You on This Website and How We Use It

We collect information you give us as you register, update your profile, create a user name and password, upload your materials, invite others to join the Connect community, as well as information about your activities in the community. We may, from time to time, supplement that information with additional information, for example, by adding data about the company you list as your employer.

We use the information we collect to provide you with the ProfNet Connect service and to contact you about your participation or registration.

We use non-personally identifiable, session cookies to collect aggregate information about how this website is used and to make reports to our client companies. You are not identified as an individual. If you choose the automatic recognition function, we will place a persistent cookie on your browser to recognize you each time you access this website.

Our log servers collect standard web information about visits and system capabilities as you access and use the web pages covered by this Policy. This information is not routinely linked to your identity.

We also allow third-party ad servers to place ads on the Connect community pages. These advertisers may use cookies, flash cookies, or other means to track your activities, either on an identifiable basis or not, on this website and beyond. Please see Your Choices below, for additional information about your choices about third party advertising.

### Your Choices

  * **Privacy Settings.** We have created the Connect community to make it easy for you to share professional information freely with other members of the Community. You may, however, limit the ability of others to view your information or contact you. 
    * Click on **My Hub** , then **Edit Profile** , then **Privacy Settings** to control access to your profile, information, online status and activities and to manage email. Please note that the default **Privacy Settings** favor making information about and shared by you public within the Connect community. 
    * Your profile information or content you have posted will be featured on the Connect home page and available to Internet search engines beyond the Connect community unless you choose to turn off this feature. You can use the **Privacy Settings** to turn off this function, blocking your information from being featured on the home page and searchable from the Internet outside the community. 
    * Click on **Edit Profile** , then **Additional Contact Info** , then **Contact Settings** to control access to your contact information (office address, e-mail, office phone, cell phone). 
    * Please note: We have given the person designated as an administrator for the company or entity that you represent the power to deactivate and then reactivate profiles for that company or entity. If your profile is deactivated, your profile information and all content you have contributed will be blocked from view and search until the administrator reactivates it. Your administrator may also delete your profile information and content making them permanently unavailable on this site.
  * **Our Cookies.** You may use the tools in most browsers to block or delete cookies. If you delete our session cookies while you are visiting the website, you may find that your session is terminated. If you delete the persistent cookie used to recognize you automatically, you will simply need to re-enter your log in information each time you visit the website.
  * **Third-Party Advertising.** We allow other companies to serve ads on [www.profnetconnect.com](http://www.profnetconnect.com/). We do not determine their use of cookies or other data collection technologies or practices. Currently, only Google AdSense serves ads to the web site. You can find out more about Google’s privacy practices and opt out choices by visiting <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html>. We may add to or change the list of third-party advertisers as the list changes without changing the effective date of this Privacy Policy. We urge you to check this section regularly.



### Other People’s Privacy

The Connect community allows you to upload content to be shared with the entire community. Please recognize that people identified in the content you post have privacy expectations or rights as well. Do not post any information that identifies an individual or any pictures of people, unless it is clear that publication would not invade those expectations or rights or you have express permission. We reserve the right to remove any content if we, in our reasonable discretion, believe doing so is necessary to protect a person’s privacy or other rights.

### Disclosure to Third Parties

We reserve the right to disclose your name and information about you published on or collected in connection with this website: 

  * to investigate potential unauthorized access or misuse of our services, 
  * to protect our assets or rights, 
  * to the member company you represent if that company requests us to do so, 
  * in response to valid legal process, or 
  * as part of a merger or an acquisition by or other transfer to a third party of some or all of our business assets.

### Security

PR Newswire uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information against theft, loss, or misuse. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

You remain responsible for protecting your user name and passwords and for the security of information in transit to us over the Internet. 

### Changes to This Policy
