# Bluestreak : Privacy

Privacy  
Bluestreak is committed to the principle that people using our technology and services, and the Internet in general, are entitled to their privacy. We only collect limited information to better serve our customers and users, while respecting the individual's right to privacy. We actively support and adhere to industry standards, and all applicable regulations and laws to ensure user privacy on the Internet. 

**Bluestreak's Web Site**

Bluestreak gathers data from visitors to our web site who voluntarily submit contact information. This information will not be sold, traded or given to a third party except in the case of companies retained by Bluestreak to manage a contact list solely on Bluestreak's behalf for the purposes of traditional or digital marketing communications. 

**Ad Serving**

Bluestreak does not use personally identifying cookies in the process of web-based ad serving and optimization. Cookies are only identified by a numeric code and are used for aggregate statistics gathering and group behavior tracking. Still, you may decline the use of Bluestreak tracking cookies, by opting out. This will place a permanent cookie on your hard drive that tells the Bluestreak servers that you are not to be tracked. 

Opt out of web cookies

Note that if you clear the cookies on your machine, it is possible that you will receive another Bluestreak cookie in the future. For more information, see our [IonAd Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20040904100514id_/http%3A//www.bluestreak.com/web/beta/IonAd_Privacy.pdf) (PDF, 16kb). 

**IonMail**

Your email address may have been collected in the past by one of our customers and is being used by our system. Rather than try to figure out which marketer or advertiser collected your information, we offer you the ability to opt out of future mailings:

Bluestreak reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions this policy at any time. If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. You should visit this page from time to time to review the then-current policy because it is binding on you. If you wish us to inform you of any changes, please send a blank e-mail to [privacylist@bluestreak.com](mailto:privacylist@bluestreak.com).
