Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information.

### External Links

The Proboardshop site contains links to other external sites. Proboardshop is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.

### Address Information

Proboardshop.com uses a form that customers can utilize to request information, products and services. We gather contact information including but not limited to physical addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and financial information (account or credit card numbers). Information gathered by Proboardshop.com is for the sole benefit and use of Proboardshop.com. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional materials. The customer's contact information can also be used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Customers may elect not to receive any e-mails should they so desire.

### Financial Information

Financial information such as credit card information, billing address, and shipping address is used to bill the user for products and services, and to effect shipment. This information is kept strictly confidential and secure. Our online surveys ask for contact information (typically an e-mail address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user promotional material from Proboardshop.com.

### Contests

We promote contests on our site from time to time where we ask visitors for contact information (typically the customer's e-mail address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our contests to send participants promotional material from Proboardshop.com. The contact information is also used to contact the customer when necessary (i.e. a contest winner.) Customers may elect not to receive future mailings. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing content that we believe they may be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

### Secure Transactions

Information such as credit card numbers are secure and safe. You can enter your credit card number on a secure (https) form and transmit the form over the Internet to a secure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining your credit card information. The security features offered by your web browser technology protects commercial transactions, as well as all other communications, from misappropriation and fraud that could otherwise occur as information passes through the Internet.

With Secure Socket Layer (SSL) implemented on both your browser and ISP server, your Internet communications are transmitted in an encrypted form. Information you send can be trusted to arrive securely and privately to the server you specify and no other. SSL uses authentication and encryption technology. For example, your browser's export implementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a High-grade, 128-bit key size. The encryption established between you and a server remains valid and in place over multiple connections, yet any illegal attempts to defeat the encryption of one message cannot be leveraged to defeat the encryption of the next message.

Your browser and secure servers deliver server authentication using signed digital certificates issued by trusted third parties known as certificate authorities. A digital certificate verifies the connection between a server's public key and the server's identification (just as a driver's license verifies the connection between your photograph and your personal identification. Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, ensure that information within a certificate can be trusted.

You can tell when you have a secure connection by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. You can also verify the security of a document by examining the security icon in the bottom-left corner of the browser window.

Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt your information. In transit, the information is meaningless and unreadable. An intermediary can continue to route the data, and even make copies of it, but the information cannot be decrypted and remains private and safely communicated.
