1.1 In this Privacy Policy:<br>
1.1.1 the ‘Sites’ means the websites located at <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk">www.amnesty.org.uk</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.unsubscribe">www.unsubscribe</a> me.org, <a href="http://www.irrepressible.info">www.irrepressible.info</a> and <a href="http://www.protectthehuman.com">www.protectthehuman.com</a>; and<br>
1.1.2 ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘Amnesty International UK’ mean Amnesty International United Kingdom Section, a private company limited by guarantee, incorporated in England and Wales with registration no. 01735872, whose registered office is at Human Rights Action Centre, 17-25 New Inn Yard, London, EC2A 3EA, which owns and operates the Sites.<br>
<br>
<a name="introduction"><strong> 2. INTRODUCTION</strong></a><br>
2.1 The Sites provide various services which include, but are not limited to, providing information on and encouraging participation in Amnesty International UK’s various campaigns to stand up for humanity and human rights and protecting individuals wherever justice, fairness, freedom and truth are denied; and providing an online community for like-minded people to take action together.<br>
2.2 The Sites are UK-based websites and we take reasonable care to comply with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (‘the Act’) relating to the personal information you supply on the Sites.&nbsp; <br>
2.3 For the purpose of the Act, we are the data controller. If you have any queries concerning this Privacy Policy or the way in which your personal data is used by us, please email our Supporter Care Team&nbsp; at <a href="mailto:sct@amnesty.org.uk">sct@amnesty.org.uk</a><br>
<br>
<a name="children"><strong> 3. CHILDREN</strong></a><br>
3.1 The Sites are aimed at people who are aged 14 years old and over.&nbsp; If you&nbsp; are aged 14 to 18, we advise you to inform your parent or legal guardian that you are registering on and/or using the Sites.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 14, you may not register on and/or use the Sites or submit any personal information to any of the Sites.<br>
3.2 If we become aware that we have collected any personal information from any person under the age of 14, we will delete this information as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
<a name="personal data"><strong> 4. YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></a><br>
The information we gather (‘Information’) may include the name and address of registered users and members, their credit or debit card number and expiry date, and email address. If you have registered on any of the Sites, the Information will include any personal information which you submit to the Site.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<a name="profile"><strong> 5. YOUR PROFILE</strong></a><br>
If you have registered as a member on any of the Sites, you may be asked to provide personal information in order to set up a profile.&nbsp; If your profile is published on a Site, it may be accessed (and transferred) outside of the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).&nbsp; By supplying personal information for your profile, you accept that it may be published on the Site in question and you consent to such transfer.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<a name="updating"><strong> 6. UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></a><br>
6.1 If any of the Information you have submitted for any account or profile on any of the Sites changes, you can update your personal information by logging in to your account on the Site in question and selecting the option provided. <br>
6.2 If you are a member of Amnesty International UK and any of your membership details changes, you can amend your membership details by emailing our Supporter Care Team at <a href="mailto:sct@amnesty.org.uk">sct@amnesty.org.uk</a>.<br>
<strong><br>
<a name="use personal info">7. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</a></strong><br>
7.1 We may use the Information you submit to the Site to notify you by email about important functionality changes and alterations to the Site, and we also use your Information to provide you with information about our other services which are similar to those we provide on the Sites, if you have indicated that you wish to receive such communications from us.&nbsp; <br>
7.2 The Information you give us will be stored on a database and may be used by us for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <br>
7.3 We may also use your Information to help us to know what incentives, appeals and actions are working well and which are not so strong and to inform future activity across the organisation, helping Amnesty International UK to be more effective in combating human rights abuses.<br>
7.4 We may permit selected third parties to use your Information, to contact you about products, services or issues which may be of interest to you, if you have given us permission to do so. If you do not wish to receive any such communications from us or third parties, you may opt out by notifying our Supporter Care Team at <a href="mailto:sct@amnesty.org.uk">sct@amnesty.org.uk</a>.<br>
7.5 We may offer you the opportunity to sign up to a mailing list and/or newsletter, to participate in a survey or a competition, or to receive information by email about third parties’ products and services, or any other products and services which we provide.&nbsp; If you sign up for any of these and subsequently change your mind, you may opt out by notifying us at our Customer Services email address above.<br>
<br>
<a name="3rd party disclose"><strong> 8. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></a><br>
8.1 Except as set out below, we will not sell, distribute or disclose your Information without your consent, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it.&nbsp; <br>
8.2 If you have subscribed to any of our e-communications, e-zines or e-newsletters, we will not sell or rent this information to anyone. <br>
8.3 As stated above, we may share your Information with selected third parties (including Amnesty International UK Section Charitable Trust and other like-minded organisations), in order to provide you with information about products, services or issues which may be of interest to you, unless you have indicated that you do not wish to receive such communications. <br>
8.4 From time to time we may work in partnership with other organisations on a campaign and so you may receive joint communications from Amnesty International UK and the partnership organisation(s) in question, unless you have indicated that you do not wish to receive such communications.&nbsp; <br>
8.5 The Co-operative Bank Plc shares with us any personal information you provide to them in the course of setting up and using an Amnesty Credit Card.&nbsp; Further information on this may be found at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=371.">http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=371.</a> <br>
<br>
<a name="3rd party transfer"><strong> 9. TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></a><br>
9.1 The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA for our own administration purposes or for the purpose of any international campaign run by Amnesty International UK and an organisation located outside of the EEA.&nbsp; Such organisations may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your personal details as a subscriber to the campaign in question and the processing of your payment details, if you make a donation to the campaign. <br>
9.2 By submitting your Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee that any organisation located outside of the EEA will have adequate safeguards for the protection of personal data, but we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
9.3 If Amnesty International United Kingdom Section or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its members may be one of the transferred assets.<br>
<br>
<a name="payment details"><strong> 10. YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS</strong></a><br>
10.1 If you use our secure financial pages on any of the Sites to join Amnesty International UK or to donate money to us online, you are going through to the website of our reputable financial partner company, RSM Technology Limited, whose principal office is at Dralda House, 24-28 Crendon Street, High Wycombe, Bucks, HP13 6LS, United Kingdom (‘World RSM’).&nbsp; World RSM handles all the secure financial transactions on the Amnesty International UK website on our behalf. The information you provide as part of any online financial transaction (such as your credit card number and contact information) is collected only so that the transaction can take place. <br>
10.2 We have a valid secure socket layer certificate running on all the financial&nbsp; information input pages and by working with World RSM we are ensuring that we are using the best security technology with regards to collection and transmission of personal financial data.&nbsp; Also, once we receive your Information, we do everything we can to make sure that it is secure on our systems. <br>
<br>
<a name="invite"><strong> 11. ‘INVITE A FRIEND’</strong></a><br>
We may from time to time operate an ‘Invite a friend’ or similar service.&nbsp; This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for you to recommend the Sites and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process.&nbsp; First, you send us your friend’s name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to join a campaign or to visit one or more of the Site.&nbsp; When we contact your friend, we always advice them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral.&nbsp; We will not use your friend’s details for any other purpose.<br>
<strong><br>
<a name="links">12. LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES’ SITES</a></strong><br>
We may provide links to other websites.&nbsp; Before supplying any personal information to any other website, we recommend that you check that website’s Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We do not accept responsibility for the protection of any data supplied to other sites.<br>
<br>
<a name="cookies"><strong> 13. COOKIES</strong></a><br>
We may use cookies to monitor how you are using the Sites, as these will help us make improvements for the future.&nbsp; You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, but if you do so parts of the Sites may not work correctly.&nbsp; Information about your computer such as your IP address, operating system and browser type may also be used to examine usage trends.<br>
<br>
<a name="security"><strong> 14. SECURITY</strong></a><br>
14.1 When you submit your Information to us on any of the Sites, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, it is not possible to guarantee the total security of any data transmitted over the Internet. While we strive to protect your Information, Amnesty International UK cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you therefore do this at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to ensure its security on our systems, but we take no responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.<br>
14.2 Please remember that other methods of Internet communication, such as emails and messages sent via a website, are not secure unless they are encrypted.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<a name="changes"><strong> 15. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></a><br>
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.&nbsp; In this case, the amended version will be published on the Site.<br>
