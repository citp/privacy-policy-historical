## Information That We Collect

The Personal Information we collect from customers helps provide you with our Services. Here are the types of information we gather:

_Information Provided by You_. During your use of the Services, we may collect certain Personal Information delivered by you to us either as part of your registration to the Services or in any other way. This personal information may be updated by you from time to time. As a result of your use of the Services, you may supply us with such personal information as your name, e-mail address, uploaded content and metadata such as the source of that content (collectively, "Personal Information").

_Automatic Information_. When using our Services, we may also collect certain analytical information that may identify you personally, including information that your browser or device generates, such as your IP address, your browser information (including browser type, capabilities and language), your operating system, the date and time you accessed the website, and the Service from which you linked to our Service ("Analytical Information", and together with the Personal Information, the "Information"). In addition, we may collect other information from you (such as location-based data) that have been stripped of your Information. We may group some or all this Information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of the Services to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. We may also group demographic information that we collect from our users into aggregate data for the same purposes. We reserve the right to use and share any aggregate and anonymized Information with third parties for any lawful purpose. We may associate your Information with non-Personal Information within our database and we treat all the associated information as your protected Information under this Privacy Policy. However, except as noted below, we do not share this associated your Information with third parties.

## Use of Information Collected

_Internal Use_. We use Personal Information for internal purposes only, to improve our Service and to better tailor the Service to meet your needs. In addition, we use the Personal Information collected to analyze Service usage and to deliver information to you about certain promotions, services or items that might interest you. We may use your e-mail address to contact you regarding Service notices from time to time.

_Editing Information_. You may review and edit any of your Information by using your e-mail address and password. If you cancel your account, your Personal Information shall be deleted from our database except for residual information within our databases, aggregate information access logs, backup logs and other records, which may or may not contain personally identifiable information.

_Resolving Problems_. We may use your Personal Information and other data obtained from your current and past activities, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

We will not sell, trade or rent your Personal Information to others unless you explicitly provide us with permission to do so.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

_At Your Request_. We will not disclose, sell or transfer any of your Information to any third parties, except if you request us to do so as part of the Services.

_Legal Disclosures_. In the event we are required to disclose Information and other related information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, we will make such disclosure.

_Sale of Business_. In the event the ownership of all or a part of our business were to change, your Information and other related information pertinent to the business' operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.

These third-party service providers are contractually restricted from using your Information for any other purpose and required to comply with all applicable laws with respect to your Information and other related information they receive.

_Special Cases_. We may disclose your Information and other related information, in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. You thus authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

## Sharing of Information
