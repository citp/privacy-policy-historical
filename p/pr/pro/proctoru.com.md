**Information Collection and Use**

**Information Collected Upon Registration**

When you create or reconfigure a ProctorU Inc. account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, the institution with which you will be taking an exam, credit card number, access to users’ camera and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and the assessment you are scheduled to take, is listed internally in our system and is accessible by your institution. Your use of the service may also result in ProctorU Inc. having a stored image of your face, a stored image of the work you perform while connected to ProctorU Inc., or a video capture of your activities while connected with ProctorU Inc. This information is used to verify to your institution that you were the person performing the work and that the work was performed properly.

**Authentication**

You may be asked to authenticate your identity through data services. These questions are generated from a public information database and usually they are scores that indicate the authenticity of users’ identity. The scores are numeric and don’t provide any personal information. Upon request, we will provide you the identity of the authentication service we are using for your account in case you wish to review their privacy policy.
