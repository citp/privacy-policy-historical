We believe that in order to foster true relationships with our customers, we need to maintain the utmost respect for every customer's privacy.  Below is an outline of our key policies we have in place in order to honor your privacy.</p>
		<p>We seek to provide you with material that is relevant to you with chances to earn or win free prizes, get discounts or coupons, participate in surveys, or just get good deals for products and services.</p>
		<h1>WE DO NOT AND WILL NOT SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS.</h1>

		<h2>Referrals of Friends</h2>

		<p>In order to refer your friends and contacts, you will be required to enter their email addresses and/or names.  We will use this information to send emails to your friends and contacts asking them to participate in our program.  The names and addresses you provide to us will be used to send a one-time email to those people.  We will not send them future emails unless they confirm (or have already independently confirmed) their subscription to receive emails from Progressing Markets.  All information you provide about your friends and contacts will be covered by this Privacy Policy. </p>	  
		<h2>Subscriptions to Promotional Materials</h2>
		<p>We will only send you marketing materials if you confirm your interest in receiving promotional materials.  When you sign up to one of our websites, we send a one-time email asking you to confirm your interest in receiving promotional materials from us.  If you do not confirm your interest, we will not send you any promotional materials.</p>
		<p>The maximum number of emails messages which we will send you in any day is ALWAYS disclosed in our confirmation email.  Our company policy is to not send more than 2 commercial messages per day to any customer.</p>	   
		<h2>Unsubscribe to all Material</h2>

		<p>The fastest and easiest way to no longer get emails from us is to click the remove link provided at the bottom of each of our emails.  This is a one-click remove process, so you will not have to enter any additional information in order to unsubscribe.  It may take up to 48 hours for our systems to complete your request, but most people get removed instantly.</p>
		<p>You can also reply to any email from us in order to get removed.</p>
		<p>Finally, you can write to the postal address provided at the bottom of each of our emails and ask to stop receiving our emails.

		<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
