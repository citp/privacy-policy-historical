        <br>
        <span class="TabContentTextRegular">Productiontrax.com values your privacy, whether you just browse the Productiontrax.com 
  Web Site ("Site"), use its services, or purchase tracks. We strive 
  to keep our privacy practices in current with the highest standards on the Web. 
  This privacy policy describes the kinds of information we collect, how we collect 
  it, and how we use it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#0066CC">WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES PRODUCTIONTRAX.COM 
  COLLECT FROM ME?</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Personally identifiable 
  information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your 
  name, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit card information 
  and password ("Personally Identifiable Information"). We may collect 
  Personally Identifiable Information from you when you (a) make a purchase from 
  our site (b) register to become a member, (c) voluntarily provide it when you 
  use the Site, (d) disclose it in a public area of the Site (such as a composer 
  bio, message board or chat room) or (e) provide it when you communicate with 
  us.<strong><br>
  <br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-personally identifiable 
  information is information that does not identify you as an individual ("Non-Personally 
  Identifiable Information"). Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes 
  information such as your browser type, the URL of the previous Web site you 
  visited, the Web pages and advertisements you view or select, and the types 
  of services you use. Non-Personally Identifiable Information also includes "Aggregate 
  Information," which is described below in the section titled "How 
  Do We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information?" We may automatically 
  collect certain types of Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you when 
  you use the Site. We may also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
  from you that you voluntarily provide (such as information included in response 
  to a questionnaire or survey) or post to a public area of the Site (such as 
  a message board or chat room).<strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0066CC">HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION?</font><br>
  <br>
Cookies.</strong>A cookie is a message that is sent to your browser from a Web 
  server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain 
  Personally Identifiable Information, such as your email address. We use cookies 
  solely to keep track of which shopping cart belongs to you when you shop on 
  our site. We use cookies only for the operation of our Site.<strong><br>
  <br>
IP Address. </strong>An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer 
  automatically when you use the Internet. We may collect IP addresses for the 
  purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and to compile 
  aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to the Site). When 
  you visit a particular Web page on the Site, our servers log your IP address. 
  Your IP address is not linked to your Personally Identifiable Information. IP 
  addresses also help us to identify individual users within our live support 
  system.<strong><br>
  <br>
Pixels. </strong>Pixels, also called clear GIFs, are invisible files on Web 
  pages that you visit. If you visit a page on the Site that contains a Pixel, 
  the Pixel communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, 
  whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement. 
  We may use Pixels to serve advertising, enhance site functionality, and track 
  usage of the Site.<strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0066CC">HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</font><br>
  <br>
Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>In general, we will not disclose 
  your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties without your permission. 
  If you make a purchase from our Site, we may use the Personally Identifiable 
  Information you provide for shipping and billing purposes only, unless you expressly 
  give us permission to use it for promotional and marketing purposes. In addition, 
  if you purchase tracks from a composer, we may provide that composer with your 
  Personally Identifiable Information to enable that composer to contact you or 
  use for their internal record keeping. We may also use the Personally Identifiable 
  Information you provide to (a) administer and manage your account, (b) pay commissions 
  to you, (c) include you on our mailing lists and (d) advertise and promote our 
  services. In addition, we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information 
  when we believe in good faith that it is required by any applicable law or legal 
  process, or if we believe we need to disclose it to protect or enforce our rights 
  or the rights of our members, users, or other third parties. Without limitation 
  of the foregoing, we may disclose your information pursuant to our Intellectual 
  Property Rights Policy to a third party that alleges you have infringed their 
  intellectual property rights. We will never sell your personally identifiable 
  information to anyone.<strong><br>
  <br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>We may disclose Non-Personally 
  Identifiable Information in connection with improving the services we offer 
  and facilitating our marketing efforts. In addition, we may combine your Non-Personally 
  Identifiable Information that relates to your use of the Site with that of other 
  users ("Aggregate Information") to determine which areas of the Site 
  are most popular, and how our services are used. By collecting this Aggregate 
  Information and analyzing it, we can use it to improve the Site. We may disclose 
  Aggregate Information in connection with improving the services we offer and 
  facilitating our marketing efforts.<strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0066CC">WARNING ABOUT ONLINE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</font><br>
  <br>
Third Parties. </strong>We do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers 
  or other third parties that have Web sites linked to the Site. If you click 
  on an advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the Web site that you link 
  to will govern the use of your information by that Web site's operator. We assume 
  no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect 
  to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, make sure you are 
  aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third-party Web sites 
  you link to. In addition, you should be aware that certain third-party services 
  or Web sites (for example, Pay Pal, or if you click on a link to one of our 
  partner's or member's Web site) that you link to from our Web site each have 
  their own information collection practices and privacy policies.<strong><br>
  <br>
Disclosure Of Information In Public Areas. </strong>If you voluntarily disclose 
  information in a public area of the Site, such as a chat room or message board, 
  that information may be collected and used by a third party to send you unsolicited 
  messages, advertisements or for other purposes. We do not control the actions 
  of these third parties in public areas of the Site, so if you disclose information 
  in a public area, you do so at your own risk.<strong><br>
  <br>
No Absolute Safeguards. </strong>Although we will use reasonable efforts to 
  safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot 
  be made absolutely secure. Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability 
  for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized 
  third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.<strong><br>
  <br>
Children's Personally Identifiable Information<br>
  </strong>We feel strongly about protecting the privacy of children. We encourage 
  children to involve their parents in any interactive activity they participate 
  in online. We will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from 
  children we know to be under the age of thirteen. In addition, once we are notified 
  we will delete any information in our databases that originates from a child 
  under the age of thirteen.<br>
  <strong><font color="#0066CC"><br>
WHAT OPTIONS DO I HAVE TO CONTROL THE USE OF MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</font><br>
<br>
  </strong>Receiving Communications And Opting Out. During the member registration 
  process, you can "opt out" of receiving certain communications from 
  us and our partners. If you are already registered, you can still "opt 
  out" from receiving these communications by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@productiontrax.com">support@productiontrax.com</a> or by accessing your account information screen. Correction And Deletion Of 
  Information. You can obtain a copy of and request that we correct your Personally 
  Identifiable Information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@productiontrax.com">support@productiontrax.com</a>. 
  For your protection, you will be required to provide proof of your identity 
  to obtain a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you desire, 
  we will delete all of your Personally Identifiable Information (except for your 
  transaction history) from our records upon your request. However, if you choose 
  to delete your Personally Identifiable Information, you may not be able to access 
  some areas of the Site.<strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0066CC">YOUR ROLE IN PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY</font><br>
  <br>
  </strong>Please remember that protection of your privacy begins with you. You 
  are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use to 
  register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing 
  information online.<strong><br>

  this Privacy Policy, and we will have the right to use your information as described 
  in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to have your information used in 
  any of the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue use of 
  the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Your 
  continued use of the Site after we either personally notify you or generally 
  post such changes on the site will constitute your acceptance of those changes.
