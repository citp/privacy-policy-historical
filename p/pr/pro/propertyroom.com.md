**I. Personal Information**(top)   
Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register for membership services. These services include receiving electronic newsletters, purchasing items, and entering contests and other promotional opportunities provided by StealitBack.com.   
We also collect email addresses from users who send us mail or request technical or other help. This information enables StealitBack.com to improve its site to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable. 

One method of collecting summarized information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our server logs your IP address. 

StealitBack.com records IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide summarized data to advertisers about the volume of use on our site. We also create summarized reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests. An advertiser will not know that you clicked its advertisement unless you voluntarily and explicitly permit us to provide such information.   


**II. Who is collecting the Information** (top)   
When you are on our website and asked for personal information, you are sharing that information only with StealitBack.com, its corporate owner PropertyBureau.com, and necessary related service providers such as a credit card processor, unless specifically stated otherwise. None of your information is shared with selling law enforcement agencies unless there is reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity on your part. 

On occasion, services on the StealitBack website may be offered in conjunction with another company. To provide this co-branded service to you, it may become necessary for us to share your personal information with another company. However, if you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

I **II. How Information is Used**(top)   
StealitBack.com uses the personal information we collect to improve the content of our site; to notify users about updates to our site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to users; and to investigate violations of our terms and conditions of use. 

**IV. Who Shares the Information** (top)   
StealitBack.com will not sell your name, address, phone numbers, email address or any information that personally identifies you to third parties. In most cases, we will jointly manage some of your information with a third party provider of auction hosting services with whom there is a relationship of strict confidentiality. In some cases, your name and shipping address may be shared with a shipping company for the purpose of shipping your purchase to you. Demographic information, such as town/city, state, zip code, sex, and age provided by you may be included in a summarized customer database profile, which may be used to attract potential suppliers and advertisers to our website. 

If you bid on an item, StealitBack.com may disclose your personally identifiable information to the law enforcement agency or party that provided the item to StealitBack.com for sale. StealitBack.com may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if StealitBack believes that its site has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that might endanger the health or safety or another user or of the general public. 

In the event that PropertyBureau.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the assets transferred to new owners.
