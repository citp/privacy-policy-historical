### 4\. With whom may your personal information be shared?

Except as explicitly described in this privacy policy, Property Room will not sell or share your name, address, phone numbers, email address, financial data or any other information that personally identifies you to third parties without your consent.

By placing an order or bidding on an item, you are granting your consent to allow us to share your information with the law enforcement agency or other third party seller or vendor providing the purchased item. To the extent that you make a purchase, you are granting your consent to allow us to share your information with related service providers (such as a credit card processor for processing payment and a shipping company for shipping your purchase to you), in each case to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill that order.

Property Room may divulge personal information to a third party service provider (such as a credit card processor) to resolve suspected fraud or other inappropriate use (or abuse) issues. In such an instance, Property Room would divulge the information to resolve the issue whether you or Property Room was suspected of the misuse, and such information would be divulged for the sole and exclusive purpose of resolving allegations of misuse or abuse.

Property Room may also divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed or requested by a law enforcement agency as part of an investigation. In addition, Property Room may divulge personal information if Property Room believes that its site has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that might endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public.

Lastly, in the event that Property Room or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Property Room would transfer all customer data and other personal information of its users to the new owner.

### 7\. What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information under Property Room’s control?

Your Property Room account information is password protected so that only you have access to it. We strongly recommend that you not divulge your password to anyone.

There are several places on the Property Room site where you can transmit credit card information to complete a purchase transaction, or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry standard, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Property Room.com stores all your personal information on secure servers and in an encrypted format.

No Internet data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Property Room cannot assure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall Property Room be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result from the use of the information or materials on Property Room, even if Property Room or its authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This section should also be read in conjunction with the full [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/policies/user-agreement) found on this site.

Property Room reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes will be posted online. Questions should be directed to [Customer Support](mailto:customersupport@propertyroom.com).
