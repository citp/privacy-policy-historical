<p><strong>Choices for personal information</strong> – When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you a choice to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. You may also decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case PropertyRadar may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to any web sites and services that are owned and operated by PropertyRadar. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within our various services.

<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow commercially accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<h2>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</h2>
<p>PropertyRadar will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical.<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their personal information may request information regarding disclosures of this information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at the following mailing address:</p>

<p>This request may be made only once per calendar year. PropertyRadar reserves the right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph.</p>
<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without providing you an opportunity to opt-out, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).</p>
