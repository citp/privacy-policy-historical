            <p>Broadridge operates this web site as an agent of your broker, bank, mutual
              fund or a corporation in which you own stock.&nbsp; This statement
              sets forth Broadridge's Privacy Statement for this web site and describes
              the practices that Broadridge will follow with respect to the privacy of
              users of this site. By using this site, you are accepting the practices
              described in this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; From time to time, we
              may change this Privacy Statement. For example, as we update and
              improve our service, new features may require modifications to the
              Privacy Statement. Accordingly, please check back periodically.
            </p>
            <p class="Subhead">What personal information is collected? </p>
            <p>Broadridge collects the personal information that you provide to us.&nbsp;
              The personal information collected at this site may include some
              or all of the following:&nbsp; your e-mail address, voting instructions
              and personal identification number (pin).&nbsp; </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="Subhead">What are cookies and how are they used? </p>
            <p>This Broadridge site, like many other commercial websites, utilizes a
              standard technology called "cookies" to collect information
              about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a website
              determine that a particular user had visited the site previously
              and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set
              while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings
              of text that websites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve
              any other data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address.
              If you are simply browsing an Broadridge informational site, a cookie may
              be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site
              before. If you are a registered user of a site providing service
              to Broadridge clients (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies
              so that we can provide personalized information based on preferences
              you have indicated while using the site. Although you have the ability
              to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you
              when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible
              to utilize Broadridge services which require registration if you reject
              cookies.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
            <p class="Subhead">How is information collected, used, and disclosed?
            </p>
            <p>If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to
              the collection and use of your personally identifiable information
              as described in this Privacy Statement. The personal information
              collected at this site is collected on behalf of the financial institution
              with which you have an account or the corporation in which you own
              registered shares, to enable Broadridge to provide the electronic voting
              service that you are electing to use.&nbsp; We may provide this
              information directly to, or use this information at the direction
              of, such financial institution or corporation and they would direct
              the use of this information in accordance with their practices.&nbsp;
              Broadridge treats the personally identifiable information that Broadridge collects
              as confidential and it is only used to carry out the services and
              activities described on this web site.&nbsp; <span class="copyBold">We
              do not sell or rent personal information collected through this
              site to anyone.</span> Also, Broadridge may provide aggregate voting statistics
              or statistics relating to visits to our sites and enrollment in
              the electronic voting program, but these statistics will include
              no personally identifying information. Broadridge may also disclose information
              in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action
              is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with
              legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; or
              (c) enforce the Terms and Conditions of use. </p>
            <p>If in the future, your financial institution or a corporation in
              which you own stock makes other electronic services available, we
              may contact you by e-mail regarding the availability of such services.
              We may also contact you by e-mail in connection with this service,
              such as providing a confirmation of your voting instructions. </p>
            <p class="Subhead">How do we protect your information? </p>
            <p>We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable
              information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard
              techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and
              site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet
              can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
              to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure
              or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or
              receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit
              to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information
              until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make
              our best effort to ensure its security on our servers.&nbsp; Internally,
              we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information
              to employees who need access to the information in order to do their
              jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to
              our privacy policies.&nbsp; We will review our security arrangements
              from time to time as we deem appropriate. </p>
            <p class="Subhead">How can you help protect your information? </p>
            <p>If you are using an Broadridge web site for which you registered and chose
              a password, PIN, user ID or other form of authentication, we recommend
              that you do not divulge this information to anyone. We will never
              ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an
              unsolicited e-mail. </p>
            <p class="Subhead">Other sites. </p>
            <p>Broadridge sites may contain links to other sites, including those of
              our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that
              share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible
              for the privacy practices employed by other sites. </p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement,
              you should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@proxyvote.com">privacy@proxyvote.com</a>
