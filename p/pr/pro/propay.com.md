# Privacy Policy

## Last Revised: May 22, 2015.  The most current version of this Privacy Policy may be viewed at any time on the ProPay website.

## Summary

This Privacy Policy covers the websites [www.propay.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20151229080801id_/http%3A///) and [www.propaypayments.com](http://www.propaypayments.com/), both owned and operated by ProPay, Inc. “ProPay”. ProPay works hard to earn and keep your trust and confidence. This Privacy Policy is posted at our web site to allow users easy and quick access to ProPay's policy regarding personal information. This notice explains how we collect and safeguard information about you and the choices you have about our use and disclosure of that information.

**  THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
**

## Required Information

We obtain information about you from a variety of sources. You provide information about yourself, for example, by completing the ProPay Account sign-up form. This form asks for your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, day and evening telephone number, Social Security number, date of birth and the creation of your unique password. Information about you may also be obtained from credit-reporting agencies, ProPay Affiliates, other third-party commercial vendors to financial services firms, and/or your use of ProPay's services. We call this information, "Merchant Account Information." Merchant Account Information is used to identify you, prevent possible fraud, and in connection to delivering ProPay Account services to you.

Unique identifier information is used to qualify for, and set up, a ProPay Account. Refusal to fully complete the sign-up form by entering accurate information will result in ProPay not being able to provide services to you. Credit card and checking account information is required to use specific services of ProPay and is used only to process those transactions you have initiated. Also, personal information from third parties may be collected by ProPay on behalf of merchants from the third parties with whom the merchant engages in business as a result of their connection with ProPay.  This third party personal information may include, but is not limited to, contact information of the third party, such as name, address, and social security number, as well as credit card information.  In the event this information is requested of the third party and collected by ProPay, ProPay shall only use this information pursuant to the purposes delineated and contemplated by this Privacy Policy as further set forth herein.

## Disclosure of Information

We use Merchant Account Information in connection with delivering payment services to you. In order to conduct financial payment-related transactions and/or to effectively deliver payment services securely to you, while minimizing the risks of financial loss, it is often necessary to communicate such Merchant Account Information to or with financial institutions such as Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover® Card Services, banking institutions involved in supporting, clearing or settling payment-related transactions, our corporate Affiliates and/or other companies we work with.

ProPay takes numerous commercially reasonable measures to protect the personal information that you share. In the event your Merchant Account becomes delinquent, you authorize ProPay to disclose and communicate all your Merchant Account Information to third parties for the purpose of collection of any delinquent amount. If you initiate a transaction that requires credit card and checking account information, ProPay uses that information only to process your payment request and will not use it for marketing purposes. ProPay may also disclose information as required by law to governmental regulatory agencies. For example, we may disclose Merchant Account Information in response to lawful subpoenas or similar legal process, to credit-reporting agencies, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, to help prevent fraud or to respond to a government request. Any third party, including by way of example and not limitation, service providers or agents, or processors with whom ProPay shares your personal information shall only be permitted to use this personal information for the purposes set forth above and which are contemplated by this Privacy Policy.  The types of third parties with whom ProPay shares your personal information shall be limited to those delineated in the foregoing, and your personal information shall not be shared with third parties which fall outside the scope of this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

If ProPay is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. 

## Security

We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural steps to help safeguard your Merchant Account Information. Our web site takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the web site, we take reasonable commercial measures to protect your information both online and off-line.

When the registration form or a transaction form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, checking account information, and/or your Social Security number), that information is electronically encrypted and is protected using secure socket layer technology (SSL). While on a secure page, such as the registration form or transaction forms, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

While we follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, we also take additional reasonable commercial measures to protect your information offline. All your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (such as ProPay's database administrators, security department employees, and customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. The servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security at ProPay's web site, please contact us at ProPay [Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20151229080801id_/http%3A//propay-support/).
