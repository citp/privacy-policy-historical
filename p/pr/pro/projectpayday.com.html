	<font color="#26701b"><b>Project Payday Privacy Policy</b></font><br><br>

	ProjectPayday.com takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy Policy in order
	to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. This page outlines our information
	gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable information.<br><br><br>

	<b><u>What information does Project Payday collect from visitors?</u></b><br><br>

	Project Payday collects information from our visitors and users of our website and uses the 
	information internally for marketing and administration purposes, in the fulfillment of our 
	service commitment to you, or as legally required under the law.<br><br>

	As a user of the Project Payday website, Project Payday may collect your personally 
	identifiable information (including certain financial information necessary to complete 
	a transaction) when you visit our site or make a purchase.<br><br>

	Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your full name, 
	home or other physical address, telephone number, email address, or credit card information.<br><br>

	Project Payday is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We 
	do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way.<br><br><br>


	<b><u>Why is information collected?</u></b><br><br>

	Information may be collected in an effort to enhance your user
	experience, provide you with information regarding Project Payday services and special 
	offers, and/or to provide you with the products and/or services that you purchase.<br><br>

	We, or our authorized third-party affiliates, may also collect general
	information about purchases as they correspond to our advertisements
	or products. This aggregate information may include demographic and
	usage information, but will not include personally identifiable
	information. This information is used in an aggregated manner (i.e.
	How many customers purchased product "X") to determine advertising
	effectiveness and is sometimes shared with our advertising partners
	for the same limited purpose.<br><br>

	In addition, information is collected for the following purposes:<br><br>

	<ul>

	<li>When you order services or register on Project Payday properties, we may
	need you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number 
	and credit card or checking account information to complete your purchase.</li><br><br>

	<li>When ordering products or services your information will be collected for purposes of 
	payment, product delivery and/or customer service related to your purchase.</li><br><br>

	<li>By registering at our web site and creating a Project Payday account, you'll
	be added to our internal mailing list. As a registered user, we may contact
	you about customer service related issues, functionality changes to the web site,
	account updates, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.</li><br>

	</ul><br>

	<b><u>Does Project Payday have security measures in place to protect my information?</u></b><br><br>

	Project Payday has implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of 
	your personally identifiable information. Users' personal information is contained behind 
	secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees.<br><br>

	When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure 
	server. All sensitive/credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket 
	Layer (SSL) technology. Should it be necessary to transmit your personally identifiable 
	information to a reputable third party vendor to fulfill our service commitment to
	you or process your credit card, Project Payday will require all recipients of such 
	information to maintain the information as confidential information, use the information 
	for the limited and intended purpose and agree not to disclose such information to third parties.<br><br><br>

	<b><u>Will Project Payday disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</u></b><br><br>

	Project Payday does not rent, sell or share any of the information collected
	by this website with other people or any other companies, except to
	provide products or services you've requested, when we have your
	permission, or under the following circumstances:<br><br>

	<ul>
	<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
	establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;<br><br></li>

	<li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
	prevent, or take action in conjunction with illegal activities, suspected
	fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of
	any person, violations of Project Payday's Terms of Use, or as otherwise
	required by law;<br><br></li>

	<li>We are required by law to provide the IRS with Tax ID numbers and/or
	other personally identifiable information about Affiliates who promote
	Project Payday and earn over $600 in affiliate commissions in a calender year.<br></li>

	</ul><br>


	<b><u>Does Project Payday use "cookies" or pixel "tags"?</u></b><br><br>

	Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive 
	to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow website operators 
	to better customize visits to the site to your individual preferences.<br><br>

	Like many Web sites, Project Payday may also use pixel tags, also known as
	beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of
	site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns,
	as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and
	response measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by
	other companies, and limit the collection of information for the same
	purpose. We do not store personally identifying information in pixel
	tags.<br><br><br>

	<b><u>What happens if there is a transfer of Project Payday's business?</u></b><br><br>

	As we continue to develop our business, we may acquire or divest various businesses 
	and/or business assets, or be acquired ourselves. In such transactions, customer 
	information generally is one of the transferred business assets.<br><br>
