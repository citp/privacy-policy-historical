2\. What This Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy covers Clicksmart’s treatment of personally identifiable information that Clicksmart collects when you are on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Clicksmart does not own or to people that Clicksmart does not employ. This includes companies and Web sites that Clicksmart may link to on the Site.

3\. Collection of Information

Clicksmart collects personal information from you when you register on the Site and when you interact with our corporate office. We may also receive personal information from our business partners. Clicksmart also automatically receives and records information from our server logs from your browser, such as your IP address, Clicksmart cookie information, the date and time of your visits, and the pages of our Site you are viewing.

4\. Use of Your Information

We use the personal information that you provide to us to generally provide you with the best possible information and services. In addition, we use the information to customize the content you see, to provide you with services, to improve the Site and our services and operations, and to contact you when appropriate.

5\. Sharing of Your Information

Because we value your privacy, Clicksmart limits the people with whom we may share your information. We will only share your personally-identifiable information with: (a) our employees and agents, in the regular course of their providing services to us, (b) our parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies, (c) other third parties if we have your consent to share the information, (d) other third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or otherwise as required by law or to protect our legal rights.

6\. Email and Requests For Information

Clicksmart allows you to email advertisers or request information from them through the Clicksmart website. Any information you enter into forms when emailing or requesting information from specific advertisers will be sent to those advertisers.

7\. Telephone Calls

In the event you utilize Clicksmart’s Click to Call feature or dial a telephone number of an advertiser on the Clicksmart site, we may forward to the advertiser details of the phone call, such as your phone number, your location, the time and duration of the call, and other information.

8\. Aggregate Information

Clicksmart collects and compiles aggregate information about our Site, our users, and our users’ demographic and behavioral information, such as how much traffic the Site receives. So long as such aggregate information does not contain personally identifiable information, we reserve the right to freely share this information.

9\. Changing Your Preferences

In certain areas of the Site, Clicksmart may give you the opportunity to specify how certain information should be used. For example, if you want to be removed from receiving marketing emails from us, you may reply to any email with the word “unsubscribe” as the subject.

10\. Cookies

Clicksmart uses cookies to identify you and your preferences, to customize the site to your preferences and improve your user experience, and to help us measure our audience and traffic patterns. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer that allow us to recognize you through several visits. By default, your browser is set to accept cookies, but if you prefer you may change your preferences to disable cookies. Companies doing business with Clicksmart, such as advertisers or business partners, may also place cookies on your computer. Those cookies are governed by their privacy policies, not this one.

11\. Children

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Clicksmart websites are not designed to attract children and Clicksmart does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Clicksmart asks parents and legal guardians to assist Clicksmart by supervising the activities of children at this web site.
