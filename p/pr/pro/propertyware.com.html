              <p align="justify"><strong>PRIVACY STATEMENT </strong><br>
                Propertyware, Inc. has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Propertyware web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally Identifiable information may be requested. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect. </p>
                <p align="justify"><br>
                  <strong>Collected Information </strong><br>
                We require customers who register to use the services ("Services") offered on our Site to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Services. At the time you express interest in attaining additional information, or when you register for the service, we may also ask for additional personal information, such as title, fax number, or additional company information. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their personal information at any time by logging into the Website and editing their Personal Information within Setup. Customers can view their updated profile to confirm their edits have been made. <br>
                </p>
                <p align="justify"><strong>The Way We Use Information </strong><br>
  Propertyware uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their company. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@propertyware.com. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing support@propertyware.com at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the Service. <br>
  <br>
  Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Propertyware Subscription Agreement, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for Services. This billing information is not used by Propertyware for marketing or promotional purposes. Propertyware uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Propertyware share any user information with these parties. <br>
  <br>
  Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). Propertyware will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Propertyware Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. <br>
  <br>
  If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Propertyware will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Propertyware does not store this information. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies: </strong><br>
  When you interact with the Propertyware Website, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. <br>
  <br>
  Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Propertyware, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 30-day trial, you remain anonymous to Propertyware. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser. <br>
                </p>
                <p align="justify">Propertyware uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows Propertyware to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Propertyware application. Propertyware uses persistent cookies that only Propertyware can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Propertyware customer or prior Propertyware Website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our service. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Third-Party Sites: </strong><br>

Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential. <br>
  <br>

Finally, Propertyware provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data. <br>
