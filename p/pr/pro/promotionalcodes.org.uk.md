**Terms and Conditions of Use**

Promotional codes attempt to provide valid codes, but sometimes these can maybe out of date due to the retailer ending the promotion early. If this is the case please contact us and we will remove the offending code. We allow visitors to submit codes, but please be aware that due to restrictions applied by our clients we are unable to publish some of these codes. The codes which we can’t accept are ones which have been issued to individuals or via an offline channel such as direct mail, magazines, or newspapers.
