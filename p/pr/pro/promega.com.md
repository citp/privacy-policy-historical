# Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy and Requests for Information

This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information collected by Promega Corporation (“Promega”) through this website (this “Website”) or other systems and processes under Promega’s control. Although this Website provides links to third-party websites, such third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

Promega assumes no responsibility for the privacy or security of information you provide to any third party through linked websites or any other means.

By using this Website, you agree that you have reviewed and understood our Terms and conditions of Use and this Privacy Policy to your full satisfaction, that you accept and are subject to our Terms and Conditions of Use of Promega Corporation Websites and this Privacy Policy, and that Promega is permitted to use your personal information as set forth below.

Our Privacy Policy is applicable and enforced for the Promega website at www.promega.com and all other websites owned by Promega. It is our intent to comply with the European Union Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the Safe Harbor Guidelines of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

### WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect contact information such as name, IP address, physical address, title, department, telephone number, areas of interest and e-­mail address. In addition, when you visit our website, we may place a “cookie,” a small computer file, on your computer to help us recognize and serve you better when you return. We keep this information to make it easier for you to utilize our site. You may delete this cookie from your computer without substantially impairing your use of our Website. We also collect information submitted by job applicants.

### HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Promega uses your personal information to process your requests and transactions, offer or furnish additional products and services, personalize the types of information you receive from Promega, assess trends in the use of this Website or purchases of products or services, develop content and functionality that helps us serve our customers’ needs, and improve the service and products we provide. Promega will not use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection without first attempting to notify you via the last e­mail address we have in our records.

We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties that assist us in providing our services, carrying out your account needs or providing you with information about their services that we believe may be of interest to you. If we transfer personally identifiable information to a third party that is acting as our agent, the third party will be required to protect the confidentiality of that information. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets, or Promega might be acquired by another company. In any of those circumstances, personal information in our databases may be included among the transferred assets.

We may use your personally identifiable information jointly with any of our majority-­owned subsidiaries so that they may assist us in achieving any of the purposes of use explained above. Promega may also use your personal information to prevent harm or injury, to prevent fraud, to protect our legal interests, to comply with or respond to legal process and to comply with applicable laws.

Resumes submitted by job applicants can be viewed by our human resources department personnel, hiring managers, employees who will be interviewing the candidate and the administrative assistants to these individuals for applicant screening and hiring purposes and for general human resources purposes.

### CHOICE

You will have the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us when we first request your information. Also, in our e-­mail communications you will find instructions for unsubscribing. You can request removal of your personally identifiable information from our databases by contacting us at the address listed below or by using the Privacy Information Request Form. To honor your request, we will need the exact information you want removed and information sufficient for us to identify the type of communication you received from us.

### ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You can access, correct, amend or delete the personal information that you have provided by using the login link then selecting “My Profile” in the left column of the Promega website. You will need to enter your username and password.

### SECURITY

We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information we collect online, including the use of passwords to gain access to your information. To protect your privacy and security, you must keep your password confidential. However, even with such measures, no one is able to guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to bypass these measures or otherwise capture information you provide over the internet.

### DATA INTEGRITY

We will take reasonable steps to see that the personal information in our systems is relevant for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current.

### ENFORCEMENT

Promega will conduct periodic reviews of compliance to verify that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, complete, implemented and accessible. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy may be subject to disciplinary action.

### SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO DATA COLLECTED OR PROCESSED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION

This Privacy Policy applies to all personally identifiable data that is subject to the European Union’s Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC and that is transferred to the United States, even if not collected at this Website. Promega has enrolled in the Safe Harbor System established by the U.S. Department of Commerce to meet the requirements of the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection. Onward transfers will be permitted only to other persons or entities who have agreed to provide a continuing adequate level of protection through participation in the Safe Harbor program or one of the other means permitted under EU Directive 95/46 EC and implementing member state laws.

If you have any concern or complaint regarding Promega’s compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles, please contact Promega where indicated below. Promega will investigate your concern or complaint and will attempt to resolve the matter with you. For complaints that cannot be resolved between Promega and the person making the complaint, Promega will cooperate with the European Data Protection Authorities as an independent recourse mechanism available to investigate unresolved complaints.

### CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check this Privacy Policy when you use our website to ensure that you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices. Our Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated.
