## Newsletter Subscriber

A registered user is added to our Newsletter Subscribers database when he/she leaves the “Yes. I want to subscribe to the ProducerSpot newsletter” option ON, on our registration page. After completing our registration process which involves clicking an activation link sent to his/her email account the user becomes a Newsletter Subscriber. Our email communication with our Newsletter Subscribers is based solely on their permission.

### _We respect your personal data!_

**We have not, and will never sell it to third parties.  **You are in control, and you can opt out at any stage.

## Email Communications

We at ProducerSpot do not send spam – ever. The goal of our existing email communications is to inform our Newsletter Subscribers of the new products releases which are published on a weekly basis. Our Newsletters include the links to our new products, information about promotions and the latest news from our industry.

We cooperate with other businesses that target similar audiences as ours – they send our newsletters to their opted-in subscriber base. We are very careful about the antispam practices of these businesses and never cooperate with companies that are outside the scope of our audience or our industry or which have an unclear Antispam Policy.

We do not sell or distribute (for financial gain or for free) or otherwise disclose any partner or customer e-mail addresses to any third parties except when legally required. **Every newsletter contains an Unsubscribe link** at the top of the message.

## Necessary Communication

There are situations which by their own nature require us to send you emails. These include:

  * Sending a message to your e-mail box with the link to activate your account at ProducerSpot
  * Sending you invoices for each completed transaction on our website.
  * Sending you emails concerning technical, legal and support matters.



Please make sure you do not flag ProducerSpot as ‘Spam’ or ‘Unsolicited’ in your email application. When you register and do not find an activation email in your inbox, check your spam folder.

When you get in contact with us (for example by email or via a form on the website) we will keep records of what is communicated.

This is to ensure we have a record of our discussion for future reference and so we can improve the website.
