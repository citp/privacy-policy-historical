The information practices of these Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites linked to Project4Hire.com and provider/distributor partners, are not governed by this Privacy Policy.

It may be necessary to disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Project4Hire.com's policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Project4Hire.com, other Project4Hire.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Project4Hire.com may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and Services.

We like to keep our Customers informed via e-mail and other means.

We also use demographic information to gather general interest in our products, to help in the analysis of product usage, purchasing, and target markets.

Please note that Project4Hire.com does provide information to outside companies (such as a credit card processing company) who perform certain functions on our behalf for billing purposes. We will not permit those companies to use the gathered information for other than the stated purpose.
