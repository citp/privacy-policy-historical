**Collection of Personal Information**  
When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering, ordering products, or entering contests, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.

**Pro Direct Select - Policy for Children**  
Pro Direct Select realises and understands that many children will visit prodirectselect.com but encourages all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any information to this web site and indeed any other web site. However, Pro Direct Select believes that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents or legal guardian to supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place.

No information collected from anyone under the age of 18 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatever as is stated when you register for competitions or promotions. Although anyone under the age of 13 is able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process.

Any publication of a competition winner's personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.
