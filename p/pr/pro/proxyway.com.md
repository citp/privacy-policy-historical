|  • I want to use external script for proxy checking. What do I do?

You should [download our CGI proxy checking script](http://www.proxyway.com/www/downloads/) (written on Perl) and install it on your server. You can also use your own scripts (e.g. on PHP, ASP) if they are based on ProxyWay Proxy Checker Script.  
To install Proxy Checker Script on your server:  
• Perl interpreter must be installed on you server.  
• You need to have access to run a Perl Script and have CGI enabled on your hosting account or server.  
• You must know the path to the Perl interpreter.  
• You should change the first line in a script so it points to the path to perl interpreter on your server.  
Usually the path to Perl is #!/usr/bin/perl or #!/usr/local/bin/perl So open script in any text editor and change #!/usr/bin/perl to the necessary path.  
• Upload the script to any executable folder (cgi-bin or other appropriate directory) in ASCII mode.  
• Perl scripts must be marked as "executable" in order to run properly when called by the web server. This is usually done by setting Execute permission (for Unix-based web servers) or Script permission (for Windows NT-based servers).  
• In your web browser, type in the address bar area full URL to the Proxy Checker script. e.g. http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/checker.pl  
If everything is right, you'll see the text that begins with "ProxyWay REMOTE_HOST"
