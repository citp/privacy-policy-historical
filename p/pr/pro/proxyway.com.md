_Proxy Question_  
• How to configure proxy settings in Internet Explorer 8.0

You can easily configure proxy settings by following the steps below:  
Open Internet Explorer.  
Then click the _Tools_ button and select _Internet Options_.  
Open the _Connections_ tab.  
Click the _LAN Settings_ button. In case of using a Dial-up or Virtual Private Network connection, select the necessary connection and click the _Settings_ button.  
Type the address and the port number of the proxy server.  
It could happen that your network requires separate proxy addresses for different protocols - HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP. In this case click the _Advanced_ button, and then type the individual proxy server addresses for necessary protocols.  
You can optionally enable or disable the 'automatically detect proxy settings' and 'use a proxy automatic configuration script' options.  
In the 'Proxy Server' area, select the _Use a proxy server for this connection_ or _Use a proxy server for your LAN_ check box.  
If necessary, enable the _'Bypass proxy server for local addresses'_ option.  
Click OK to apply your changes.
