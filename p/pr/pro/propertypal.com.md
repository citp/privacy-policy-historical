## 2\. Information We Need

The information we learn from our customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience on this website. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wishlists and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.  
We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us at [support@propertypal.com](mailto:support@propertypal.com). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.  
PropertyPal.com is committed to protecting your privacy and security. We will ensure that any information we obtain and use will always be held, used and transferred in compliance with all applicable data protection rules.  
We do collate statistics about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we pass on to trusted third parties to assist us in improving the service we provide to you. However, none of this information will identify individuals.  
Information is kept securely in accordance with our internal security policy and may be used to:

  * 1\. Process and deliver your Order;
  * 2\. Provide Customer Support services to you;
  * 3\. Provide you with an up to date, efficient, and reliable service;
  * 4\. Help prevent fraud (eg. we may check credit card details with our credit agency and reserve the right to refuse Orders on that basis. Your credit rating can be checked for a nominal fee with the main UK agencies Equifax and Experian);
  * 5\. Open and run your PropertyPal.com customer account;
  * 6\. Provide a more personal shopping experience.



By making an Order and/or submitting your data to us you agree to this use.

## 3\. Accounts & Passwords

Your account contains your delivery and billing details, email preferences and a record of your orders. You will need your email address and password to see or edit your personal details. Please note that we do not store your credit card details online.

## 4\. Information We Gather

Here are the types of information we gather.  
Information You Give Us: we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.  
Automatic Information: we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses this website. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalised experience at this website if we cannot recognise you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.  
Email Communications: to help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from PropertyPal.com if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please adjust your email preferences in “My Page”. 

## 5\. Security of Personal Information

When you enter credit card information to this website our secure servers ensure that all details are encrypted at your browser before they are sent to us. During the order process we store your personal details on secure servers. We store credit card details separately on servers that are not reachable from the internet.

## 6\. Security Checks

As part of our policy to protect against the fraudulent use of credit cards, we carry out random security checks on orders. These can take various forms, and may involve contacting you by telephone before your order is processed.  
From time to time it may be necessary for us to ask you to provide a copy of a recent statement header for the card being used on your order. Please note that we are only interested in confirming information already provided on your order, i.e. the billing name and address and card issuer details, and do not need to see actual transactions, which can be covered up. In case you have any concerns regarding security, we can assure you that all information is shredded as soon as we have confirmed the details required.  
We hope you appreciate that these measures are a necessary precaution, undertaken in the interests of fraud prevention.

## 7\. Who Else May See Your Information

PropertyPal.com may, if required, pass on the details of your order to UK Customs & Excise.

## 8\. Data Controllers

The Data Protection Act 1998 requires us, as registered Data Controllers, to be open about our holding and use of personal data. It also entitles individuals to find out from us what personal data is held about them on computer, to have that information corrected or erased if it is inaccurate, and to claim compensation if they can prove they have suffered damage from an inaccuracy or breach of security. PropertyPal.com is committed to upholding the eight Data Protection Principles of good information handling practice.

## 9\. The Data Protection Principles

As Registered data controllers, we must comply with the Data Protection Principles in relation to the personal data we hold. Broadly they state that personal data shall:

  * 1\. Be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully.
  * 2\. Be processed only for limited purposes which are described in the register entry.
  * 3\. Be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are held.
  * 4\. Be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
  * 5\. Be held no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which they are held.
  * 6\. Be processed in accordance with the data subjects' rights.
  * 7\. Be surrounded by proper security.
  * 8\. Not be transferred to countries outside the EEA without adequate protection.

A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.  
Our site makes use of cookies. Cookies are used for the following purposes:

  * Completing the user's current activity
  * Website administration
  * Research and development



This website uses cookies as part of the mechanism to hold the contents of the shopping basket during each visit that you make to the site, and as such we recommend that both permanent and session cookies be enabled.  
There is no requirement to have 3rd party cookies enabled for our site to work, however we may occasionally carry out market research, which a third party may assist with, during which they may issue a cookie from our site. Some of our carefully selected affiliate partners may also issue cookies so that they can track sales at this website through them. If 3rd party cookies are not accepted it does not affect the functionality of our site.

## 11\. How secure is Information About Me?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.  
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.  
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.  
It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
