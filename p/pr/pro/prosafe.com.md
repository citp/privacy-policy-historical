## Prosafe’s processing of personal data

**Our legal basis for processing**  
Prosafe will always process personal data fairly and lawfully, and only for a specified, explicit and legitimate purpose or as required by law. Prosafe will ensure appropriate information security related to confidentiality, integrity and availability. 

Prosafe will only process personal data where there are legal grounds to do so. Most commonly, we will process your personal data: (i) in order to fulfil a contract with you or in pursuit of entering into a contract with you; (ii) where required by law; or (iii) where it is in our legitimate interests to do so (and those interests are not overruled by your own rights).  Our legitimate interests are listed above under “How we collect and use personal data” and concern our wish to constantly improve our website, establish a professional and collaborative relationship with you, provide our business services and respond to any queries you may have for us. The legal basis for processing your e-mail address when you subscribe to a newsletter is your consent, which you are free to withdraw at any time.

Unless you are notified otherwise, we will not use profiling, or automated decision making in any form, to make important decisions that will affect you.

**Sharing of personal data**  
Prosafe will not share your personal data with third parties except for in circumstances where such sharing is necessary as part of our regular operation or to provide our services as further described in this section.

Third party service providers, including providers of IT services may process personal data on behalf of Prosafe. Prosafe will implement adequate safeguards in accordance with applicable law to protect your personal data processed by third party service providers.

We will not disclose your personal data to third parties for the purposes of allowing them to market their products or services to you.

**International transfers of personal data**  
When sharing personal data to other parties, we sometimes need to transfer personal data to a country outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to be able to fulfil one of the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. As an example, we may need to transfer personal data to a Prosafe company outside the EU/EEA in order to be able to offer you a job if you have applied for a position outside of the EU/EEA.

We will not transfer personal data to a third country outside of the EU/EEA that does not provide adequate protection of personal data unless appropriate safeguards are adduced or the transfer otherwise takes place in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Examples of such safeguards are Binding Corporate Rules, EU Standard Contractual Clauses or if the receiving party is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.

**Cookies**  
As noted above, the Prosafe website uses cookies to ensure you get the best user experience. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device to track usage patterns and record preferences. Our cookies do not contain information that can identify persons. Prosafe gives an explicit notice when entering the website www.prosafe.com that we use cookies. If you continue browsing, we assume you accept the use of cookies.  You can set your browser not to accept cookies. 

**Security of processing**  
We will process your personal data securely and will apply and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Access to personal data is strictly limited to personnel of Prosafe, its direct or indirect subsidiaries at all levels and its third party contractors referenced above who have appropriate authorisation and a clear business need for that data.

**Retention and deletion of data**  
Your personal data will be retained as long as necessary to fulfil the legitimate purpose(s) for the processing and as long as required by law. It will then be destroyed. If you or your employer have a contractual relationship with us, any personal data relating to you will be retained as long as necessary to enable us to fulfil our obligations relating to that contractual relationship.

If you apply for a job, we will retain your personal data for one year from when the position is filled, and delete it thereafter, unless you request us to retain it for a longer period of time in order to notify you of similar job offerings. If you consent to certain processing, we store your personal data until you withdraw your consent or once the personal data is no longer necessary for achieving the purpose of the processing.

**Your rights as a data subject**
