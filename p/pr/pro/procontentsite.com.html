<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a
standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below,
"What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect
information about how our Web site is used. Information
gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the
date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our
Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after
our Web site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Do We Use the
Information That You Provide to Us?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Broadly
speaking, we use personal information for purposes of
administering our business activities, providing the products
and services you requested, to process your payment,</span>
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">,</span>
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">to monitor

      our site and better tailor it to meet your
      needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Furthermore, such
information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis.
Personally identifiable information or business information
will not be shared with parties except as required by
law.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Occasionally, we may also
use the information we collect to notify you about important
changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we
think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if
you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the
link provided on the newsletter.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
<br></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What Are
Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an
anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that
site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this
file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for
cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser
if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your
privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you
by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may
alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If
you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible
that some areas of our site will not function as effectively
when viewed by the users.</span> <b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A cookie cannot retrieve
any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer
viruses.</span></b></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Do We Use Information
We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use
cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is
necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web
server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number
of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are
most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly
improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do
not allow us to gather any personal information about you and
we do not intentionally store any personal information that
your browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">IP
Addresses</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are
connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is
used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP
addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part
of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that
data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to
you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Sharing and Selling
Information</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the
information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email
addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent
it is necessary to process transactions or provide services
that you have requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How Can You Access and
Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable
information that we collect online and maintain in our database
by emailing us at the usual address.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What
About Legally Compelled Disclosure of
Information?<br></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may disclose
information when legally compelled to do so, in other words,
when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for
the protection of our legal rights.</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may also disclose
account information when we have reason to believe that
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact
or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our
Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the
Public.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What About Other Web
Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites
linked to or from our Web site or the information or content
contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided
solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful
to the users of our Web site.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Please
remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to
another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including
web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that
Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules
and policies before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Your
Consent</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of
your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time
with or without notice.</span></p>

<p><em><b><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our
Commitment To Data Security:</span></b></em></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Please
note that your information will be stored and processed on our
computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal
data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws
of your Country of residence or citizenship.</span>
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">To
      prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and
      ensure the correct use of information, we have put in
      place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
      procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
      collect online.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not
receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will
discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as
technically feasible.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Surveys
&amp; Contests</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">From
time-to-time our site requests information from users via
surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests
is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
whether or not to disclose this information. Information
requested may include contact information (such as name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify
the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used
for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and
satisfaction of this site.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A
Special Note About Children</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Children
are not eligible to use our services</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">unsupervised and we ask
that children</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(under the age of 14) do
not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor,
you can use this service only in conjunction with permission
and guidance from your parents or guardians.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Acquisition or Changes in
Ownership</span></b></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In the
event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its
assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part
of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are
transferred.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Policy
Modifications<br></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may change this
Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to
this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us
permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure
to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if
the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the
personal information you have submitted to us under this
Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with
this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</span></p>
