**1.     BACKGROUND**  
This is the official privacy policy and statement of California privacy rights ("Privacy Policy") of Digital Entertainment Corporation of America (“DECA” or “us”) and related websites (collectively, the "DECA WEBSITE") and is part of and subject to the terms of use for the DECA WEBSITE (the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”), which can also be found at the DECA WEBSITE.  Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have such meanings as are set forth in the Terms of Use.  By using the DECA WEBSITE or any of the updates and by providing information through or at the DECA WEBSITE, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not use the DECA WEBSITE, or provide any information through or at the DECA WEBSITE.

This Privacy Policy is intended to apply only to the Personal Information collected by DECA as a result of your use of the DECA WEBSITE and does not cover any information collected in any other manner, for any other purpose or by any other web site or enterprise.  For purposes herein, when we refer to “Personal Information,” we mean information such as your name, address, telephone number, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you.  Personal Information also includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with the DECA WEBSITE, if you have been a user or you have provided this type of information to DECA.  Your provision of such Personal Information may enable you to participate in beta tests, contests, promotions, trial offers, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to receive text messages and/or emails, to subscribe to newsletters or mailing lists, or to purchase products, content and services using the DECA WEBSITE.

DECA reserves the right, without advance notice to you, to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revisions and/or the revised Privacy Policy on the DECA WEBSITE.  Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting.  DECA encourages you to check this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use often for updates.  DECA may also e-mail you about any changes to this Privacy Policy when they have been made.  Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the DECA WEBSITE secure and ensuring your understanding of how DECA collects, uses, discloses and maintains your Personal Information is important to DECA. DECA endeavors to maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information.

**2.     RESTRICTED ACCESS**  
The DECA WEBSITE is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older and if you are not yet 13 years old, or your use of the DECA WEBSITE is prohibited or restricted in any way by the laws, regulations or other governmental requirements of the jurisdiction in which you live or reside, or if, for any reason and at any time, you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use, please discontinue using the DECA WEBSITE immediately because by using or attempting to use the DECA WEBSITE, you are certifying that you are at least 13 years of age and meet all other eligibility requirements for your use of the DECA WEBSITE.

In the event that DECA or our Affiliates unknowingly send an e-mail or other message to a child (a person under the age of 13 years) who has improperly registered with the DECA WEBSITE, the child or the child's parent or legal guardian always have the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future e-mails or text messages using the opt-out (e.g., unsubscribe) mechanism contained in the e-mail or message, or to request termination of the child's registration and status as a registered user with the DECA WEBSITE.

**3.     GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION**  
The DECA WEBSITE is designed and targeted to United States ("U.S.") audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S.  DECA makes no representation that the DECA WEBSITE is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations or is governed by other nations.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you use the DECA WEBSITE, you do so at your own risk and initiative and you are responsible for compliance with all of the laws and regulations that apply to you.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to DECA or DECA obtains as a result of your use of the DECA WEBSITE, will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law.  By using the DECA WEBSITE, participating in any DECA WEBSITE activities and/or providing DECA with your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and processing of Personal Information to the U.S. and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European Economic Area.  Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.

All users of the DECA WEBSITE are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and DECA will reject and delete any entry that DECA believes in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

Your continued participation on the DECA WEBSITE indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.  DECA may, from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format.  DECA may also combine Personal Information DECA collects online with information available from other sources, including information received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or advertisers.  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with Section 11 of the Terms of Use, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.

If you provide personal information to us with respect to potential employment opportunities with DECA, such as your resume, DECA will treat such personal information as confidential and use it only to consider you for current and future employment opportunities and to contact you with respect to employment with us or DECA’s Affiliates. An "Affiliate" is a person or entity that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, DECA. We may retain your information for further recruitment opportunities that may arise, unless you tell us that you no longer wish for us to retain your information.

**4.     CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**  
A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purpose is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a user, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business maintains and adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless (1) the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or (2) the customer refrains from exercising an option that prevents the disclosure.  Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As stated in this Privacy Policy, DECA does not share Personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you agree to such disclosure -- either by opting in to receive information from such a third party, or choosing not to opt-out from receiving such information.  To prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites, or, if applicable, opt-out from such use.  Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party or refrain from opting out from such sharing, your Personal Information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.  If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use Personal Information.  You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you may send an e-mail to [customerservice@deca.tv](mailto:customerservice@deca.tv), or you may contact us by regular mail at: DECA, Attention: VP, Programming, 1299 Ocean Ave., Ste. 410, Santa Monica, CA 90401.

All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.  For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail.  Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) DECA will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. DECA is not responsible for notices that are not labeled or not sent properly or do not have complete information.

To all users of the DECA WEBSITE, if you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to [customerservice@deca.tv](mailto:customerservice@deca.tv), or you may contact us by regular mail at: DECA, Attention: VP, Programming, 1299 Ocean Ave., Ste. 410, Santa Monica, CA 90401.

If you use any of the community features and functions that may be made available on or through the DECA WEBSITE, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public.  You should exercise caution when disclosing any Personal Information in such communities, as you do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes.  DECA will be in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information that you disclose or receive through these venues, if any, and you should assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be available publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization.  Additionally, to the extent that the DECA WEBSITE may have certain features that allow you to send information to others, DECA may monitor such messages via electronic software or personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive language, as well as for content that may infringe DECA’s rights or the rights of others, all of which we may remove at any time.  DECA will not otherwise access these messages except in certain cases, including but not limited to times when we receive specific complaints related to a particular message or are compelled to do so by law.  Also for administrative purposes, DECA may opt to keep a mail log that will include a record of which users sent messages and to which users or email addresses they were sent.

**22.     REVIEW, UPDATE OR DELETE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information collected by the DECA WEBSITE.  You may also correct factual inaccuracies.  However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility cannot be deleted, but can be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.  Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension or termination of any registration you may have made.  To review, update or delete your Personal Information collected by the DECA WEBSITE, please go to your account page from either the parentsask.com home page or any of the links to edit your preferences or the information associated with your account on the DECA WEBSITE.

Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the DECA WEBSITE in violation of the Terms of Use who wish to terminate their child's registration must send us an e-mail at [customerservice@deca.tv](mailto:customerservice@deca.tv) and provide us with their child's User ID or alternatively, a parent must provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child.  Children under the age of 13 that are unknowingly registered on the DECA WEBSITE are in violation of our Terms of Use.  DECA will not allow direct access to a user's registration and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID (Please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If a parent does not have his or her child's User ID, the parent will be required to send an e-mail to [customerservice@deca.tv](mailto:customerservice@deca.tv), or you may contact us by regular mail at: DECA, Attention: VP, Programming, 1299 Ocean Ave., Ste. 410, Santa Monica, CA 90401.  Note, you must include the parent's name, address, telephone and e-mail address, in addition to the child's name and e-mail address associated with the child's User ID registered on the DECA WEBSITE, plus the child's date of birth.  DECA will send a confirming e-mail to the parent via the e-mail address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child's registration.  The parent must then confirm by sending a reply e-mail to the designated return address.  DECA will then terminate the child's account but will notify the child of the termination request via e-mail and will identify the name, address and e-mail address of the person making the request.

**23.     RESERVATION OF RIGHTS**  
DECA reserves the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including, without limitation, a user of any services, features or functions of the DECA WEBSITE, if DECA believes there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access any services, features or functions of the DECA WEBSITE.  If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information.  In such cases, DECA will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.

**24.     QUESTIONS**
