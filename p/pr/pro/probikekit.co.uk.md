 **What Data Do We Collect?**

As with all online retailers, in order to deliver a high quality service it is essential that we collect and store certain information about you. We use your information to process your orders, inform you of any delays or problems and to send you news, special offers and promotions. The information we collect is:

Your name

Email address

Your billing and delivery address

Telephone numbers

Marketing permissions

We will normally contact you by email, including when we confirm your order, its dispatch and any news and marketing material. We generally won't need to call you by phone, and will only do this if there is an issue with an order or purchase, there are queries on your account or you have asked us to contact you. We may send you certain marketing material by text to your mobile phone. As well as using your delivery address to ship the goods, we may also send news and marketing materials by post. We collect credit or debit card details when you place an order, and will use these to collect payment, following security checks, only with your authority.

We only send you news items and marketing material with your consent. If you have been receiving such material, but do not wish to continue, or haven't been receiving it but wish to, you can change your newsletter preferences or change your post and SMS preferences. Alternatively at the bottom of every PBK email there is an unsubscribe link, click this and you will no longer receive email marketing messages from us. If you are having problems unsubscribing please contact us and we will be glad to help.
