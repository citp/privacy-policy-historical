# Privacy Policy - Customer Service | Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site

_Last Updated: Sept. 10, 2018_

NFL Enterprises LLC, the National Football League, and the other members of the NFL Family (collectively, “NFL,” “we,” “our,” “us”) respect your privacy and value your trust and confidence.  This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to our website www.ProFootballHOF.com,  (the "Services"), and explains how we collect, use, and disclose information through the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to NFL properties that do not link to this Privacy Policy (including NFLShop.com and NFLRush.com) or to information collected by the thirty-two individual NFL member clubs (the "Member Clubs").  In some instances, we may direct you to a site that is operated by a third party service provider. Even though the page where you provide information may have the look and feel of the Services, a different privacy policy may govern that information collection by our third party service provider.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please first contact George Veras at 330-588-3658. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

  *   **Service Providers:**  We may share your information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (such as to host the Services, fulfill orders, provide products and services, manage databases; perform analyses, process credit card payments, provide customer service, or send communications for us). These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

  * **  Business Transfer:** If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, a business reorganization, or similar event, we may transfer your information as part of such transaction.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

  *  The Services and our partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts. These technologies are used for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing trends, administering the Services, analyzing how users interact with the Services, and gathering demographic information.  By using the Services, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.  
  *  Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use certain features may be limited. 
  *  As true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clicstream data.  We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.   
 



## Advertising

  
We partner with third party advertisers to serve and display advertising on the Services.  These partners may use cookies and Web beacons to collect information about your activities across different websites and services to provide you with relevant advertising.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note you will continue to receive generic [ads](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/).

## Links to Other Websites

The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at HOFPrivacy@ProFootballHOF.com.  

## Data Retention

  
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you the Services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  
 

## Children’s Privacy

The Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.   If we are made aware we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years old in a manner that is inconsistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we will delete this information as soon as possible.

The NFL’s online properties that are directed to children, such as NFLRush.com, link to a different privacy policy.

## Communications Preferences and Access

You may choose to receive promotional emails, newsletters, and similar communications from us.  You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or “unsubscribe” link included in the commercial e-mails you receive.  Please note that opt-out requests may take up to 10 days to be effective.  Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature.  For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.

If your information changes, or if you no longer desire to use the Services, you may request that we update, delete inaccuracies, or remove certain information by signing into your account and making the required changes, by emailing our Customer Support at [HOFPrivacy@ProFootballHOF.com](mailto:HOFPrivacy@ProFootballHOF.com), or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below.  

You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing your device settings. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. 

## Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [CAPrivacyRights@nfl.com](mailto:CAPrivacyRights@nfl.com) or write us at CA Privacy Rights, NFL Digital Media Group, 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10154.

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

  
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.  
 

## International Users

  
Please note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States.  While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, we commit to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.
