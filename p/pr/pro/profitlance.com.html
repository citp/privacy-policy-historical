<br>
<br>

"The information and resources in it far outweigh the cost of the membership."
<br><br>
"You have my congratulations on a "First Class Product" and I am extremely impressed with its content... I know you are very busy, but again a "BIG THANK YOU" you are a Great Mentor..."
<br>
<br>
"First let me say I love this program! I'm actually learning and doing something instead of just reading some over-hyped guru crap."
<br><br>
"First, let me tell you that I am very impressed with Profit Lance. I think it is a very informative and professional web site."
<br><br>
"Thank you for putting together this valuable course, already I have learn't so much and I only got started yesterday!"
<br><br>
"I really like the site, you've done superb job of putting together a self-paced course which is on a par with any self-paced or even regular college course that I've ever taken, and that is tons of them - even at the graduate level."
<br><br>
"I have just done a swift perusal of the program and I am awe struck by the amount of technical information and the step by step projects and tutorials."
<br>
<br>

"You are actually by far the most impressive teacher I have come across."
<br><br>
"Just a note to say that your Profit Lance course is so incredible. I have ideas swimming in my head with every page I read ..."
<br><br>
"The Profit Lance [Course] is a superb course - very good for newbies like me ..."
<br><br>
"... Thanks for this outstanding course I have learned so much and I am doing things on here I never thought possible ..."
<br>
<br>



"Your course is the only 'real' offering of its kind on the web. That's saying a lot. I think you have a truly 'legitimate' product."
<br><br>
"I can't tell you how much I appreciate this course, you and your professionalism and the hand to hand guidance. It's just like having your own personal internet marketing tutor!!"
<br><br>
"I am new to the Profit Lance course and so far I think it's  awesome. I had been calling myself and Entrepreneur but your course showed me I am a beginner."
<br><br>
"I am astounded by what you are doing. There is absolutely no educational opportunity on or off the internet that offers what Profitlance offeres. The tuition could be considered next to free for the value."

<br>
<br>

"Profit Lance has proved to be the most informative program I have come across."
<br><br>
"The site is amazing for the money and I am happy to see that you take a keen interest in your members."
<br><br>
"I would personally like to thank you for what you have taught me and the other members. You are true  mentors and care about us and that is what makes the site so great."
<br><br>
"I think Profit Lance has been absolutely great so far. The course has given me the tools to literally go from 'surfer' to 'webmaster' in a few short months."
<br><br>
"Profit Lance is my favorite course and source of information. I have bought several money making opportunities and, in my opinion, they all fall short of actually giving what they promise. Profit Lance goes beyond what anyone could imagine for the price."
<br>
<br>

"I'm still in awe of the whole system. This really could be a college course on internet marketing strategies ... by the way, I finally convinced my husband to start taking an active role in the learning process. His first comments were WOW, how did we get so lucky."
<br><br>
"I just got this today and I am an absolute abecedarian when it comes to internet marketing, but I can tell you this is undoubtedly the best introduction to internet marketing sources and strategies I have had the good fortune to stumble upon."
<br><br>
"I neglected to mention, Profit Lance is just what I have been seeking after more than six months of purchasing useless material from Internet Marketing Pre-Madonnas..."
<br><br>
"I want to thank you for creating a great product. Two weeks ago I basically knew nothing about this business. I've really learned a lot in this short period of time."
<br><br>
"This is the most AMAZING collection of internet marketing information I have ever seen! Count me as being one of your faithful affiliates despite my usual strategy of NOT marketing others Internet marketing materials!"
<br><br>
"I continue to be impressed with the thoroughness of your program."
<br><br>
"I got to tell you this course is absolutely incredible. As a beginner I have hit the exact snags you have mentioned. It is like going to the carnival with barkers on every corner selling crap ... at any rate, I really admire what you have created here."
<br><br>
"I subscribed to your service and I am amazed by it. You sure have built something..."
<br><br>
"I want to thank you for an outstanding educational cause of online marketing which I have studied very carefully. I bought it two months ago and it is trulyl the best and most honest product I have bought on the web."

<b>PRIVACY POLICY</b>
<br><br>
Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. 
<br><br>
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members") - what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
<br><br>
Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used
<br><br>
Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. 
<br><br>
Registration:  Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
<br><br>
 However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. 
<br><br>
In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. 
<br><br>
Our Company Partners and Sponsors:  Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. 
<br><br>
Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered. 
<br><br>
Online Shopping:  At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. 
<br><br>
If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. 
<br><br>
If you order services or products directly from our company we will use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 
<br><br>
Online Advertisements:  Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. 
<br><br>
Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.
<br><br>
Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party. 
<br><br>
Voluntary Customer Surveys:  We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 
<br><br>
We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.
<br><br>
Special Cases:  It is our company's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 
<br><br>
However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members. 
<br><br>
"Cookies" and How Our Company Uses Them. A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. Our company may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. 
<br><br>
If you are a Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. 
<br><br>
Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 
<br><br>
Our Company Commitment to Children's Privacy. Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons eighteen years or older.
<br><br>
YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OR OLDER TO ACCESS THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS THIS WEB SITE FOR ANY REASON. DUE TO THE AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR USE OF THIS WEB SITE, NO INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THIS WEB SITE, FALLS WITHIN THE CHILD ONLINE PRIVACY ACT (COPA) AND IS NOT MONITORED AS DOING SO. 
<br><br>
Public Forums:  Please remember that any information you may disclose in any Member Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas. 
<br><br>
Our Company's Commitment to Data Security:  Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. 
<br><br>
Where to Direct Questions About Our Privacy Policy:  If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices described herein, you may contact us through the contact information provided on this Web site. 
<br><br>
Revisions to This Policy: Our company reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy, our Terms Of Service agreement, and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner, by updating this posting.
