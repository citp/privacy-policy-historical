5.2 Cookies do not attach to your system or damage your files. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies. Note, however, that "personalised" services may be affected if the cookies option is disabled. To view your security settings in Internet Explorer, access the Internet Options within the tools menu in your browser and select the Privacy tab to choose a privacy setting for the internet zone you are in.

5.3 Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site. We use session cookies to remember you as you move from page to page, so you do not need to continually log in.

5.4 Persistent cookies stay in the cookie file of your browser for longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). We use persistent cookies when you revisit the website so that you do not need to log in again (if you so request); track your country to enable us to provide country-specific content, track whether you entered our site from a link on a site of one of our business partners, avoid showing you the same advert repeatedly, to display adverts or other content tailored to your preferences.

7.4 Don’t forget that email communications over the internet are not secure if they haven’t been encrypted. Your emails may pass through servers in a number of countries before they reach us. So we don’t accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal data that stems from a cause beyond our control.
