**Purpose of the privacy policy of the Profits25.com website**  
This privacy policy of the website deals with the handling of the personal information of identification which is collected when you visit the site and when you are using the services of the site, as described in this privacy policy.  
This privacy policy applies neither to the practices of companies which Profits25 does not own or control, nor to people that Profits25 does not employ or direct, including particularly the advertising partners of the resource website or sponsoring third party to whom you provide information. Profits25 is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to connect from its website or from the resource site.  
Profits25 encourages you to examine each site's privacy policy and disclaimers so that you may understand and consent to how they may collect, use and share your personal information.

**Exchanging and supplying information**  
Profits25 may send your personal identification information to third parties when:  
\- we respond to subpoenas, court orders or procedural acts.  
\- we think it necessary, as established in full freedom, to investigate, prevent or take action against illegal activities, suspected frauds, emergency situations involving potential risks and threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Use of Profits25 or as required by law.

**Third party’s advertising**
