**3\. What are "cookies" and does OLGC use them?**  
A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer. This unique number identifies your browser, but not the individual, whenever you visit one of OLGC's Web sites. These cookies will not let a Web site know any personal information about you, such as your name and address. Since these cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information to anyone. Cookies are used on many major Web sites. Many browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. 

To help serve you better, OLGC uses two types of cookies: session cookies (temporary) and persistent cookies (longer-term continuing use). Session cookies are used to support on-line feedback/discussion, forms and registration and our sports payout calculator functionality. They are used only during your online session and expire when you close your browser. Without session cookies, moving around our Web sites would be much slower. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive for some length of time. They are usually used if you want us to remember information about your Web preferences (e.g. language preference) and passwords for automatic log-in purposes.

**4\. Who is collecting the information?**  
When you provide personal information at any OLGC Web site, that information is collected by OLGC. OLGC may offer sweepstakes, contests or promotions on OLGC Web sites. These sweepstakes, contests or promotions may be operated by third parties on behalf of OLGC, in which case personal information may be collected by such third party, or disclosed to such third party by OLGC. If you do not want to have OLGC share your personal information for such purposes, you can choose not to opt-in to the sweepstakes, contest or promotion.

**5\. How does the OLGC use the information it collects?**  
Any personal information you provide to OLGC when registering for products and services at any of OLGC's Web sites is maintained by OLGC and OLGC's authorized web hosting provider, unless specifically stated otherwise. Furthermore, only certain employees of OLGC have access to personal information submitted through OLGC Web sites. OLGC requests information from its users so that they can enjoy customized experiences across OLGC Web sites. OLGC may use the information it collects as follows: 

  * To offer its users the ability in the future to customize or personalize content on OLGC Web sites. 
  * To deliver products and services requested by consumers. 



OLGC also uses the anonymous, aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behaviour of our Web site visitors. Without such data, it would be difficult for us to know what the most popular areas of the OLGC Web sites are, and it would be difficult for us to change and update the content and services appropriately. OLGC also uses such data to monitor and improve the operation of our Web sites and to maintain the quality of the products and services available through our Web sites. 

If you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion through OLGC's Web sites, OLGC will use the personal information you provided to contact you in the event you win. All such OLGC contest entry forms will provide a way for a consumer to opt-in to any communications that is not related to awarding prizes for the promotion. Any information you provide will not be shared with such third parties unless you agree through the appropriate consent box on the entry form. If you enter a contest, you may be asked, under the rules of the contest, to agree that the contest sponsor may use your name in relation to announcing and promoting the winners of the contest. OLGC may disclose personal information where required by the operation of law or by a judicial or governmental body.

**8\. What kinds of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?**  
OLGC has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control.

While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we make reasonable efforts to prevent such occurrences. OLGC is not liable for any use or disclosure of your personal information that is beyond our reasonable control.
