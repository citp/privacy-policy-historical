**1\. What information of yours do OLGC Web sites collect?**  
The goal of OLGC's Web sites is to be your premier destination for OLGC lottery and gaming related information on the Internet . To achieve this goal, OLGC needs to collect information to understand what services and products best meet the needs of our consumers. OLGC collects two types of information, "anonymous information" and "personal information". 

Anonymous information refers to information that is not about an identifiable individual. Each time a visitor comes to an OLGC Web site, OLGC may collect information that is necessary to improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. OLGC may collect computer and connection information such as the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from a .ca, .com, .gov or .edu domain), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an OLGC Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). OLGC also collects aggregate statistics relating to page views to gauge the performance of certain areas of our Web sites. OLGC collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring and continuous Web site improvement. To collect and analyze this information, www.OLGC.ca utilizes a log analysis tool. Note that, www.OLGC.ca utilizes a log analysis tool together with a data-tagging technique to compile their aggregate, non-personally identifiable information. Data tags allow OLGC to measure which software plug-ins our consumers are utilizing, thus resulting in more effectively designed Web sites. 

In addition to this anonymous information, OLGC may also collect information that is about an identifiable individual, referred to within as personal information. Personal information includes information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address. 

OLGC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of OLGC's Web sites: 

  * Personal information is gathered when you voluntarily register with one of OLGC's Web sites. Specific functionality, such as winning number email alerts, requires registration information in order to provide the requested service. Upon registering, you will be asked to provide OLGC with your name, email address or other information as requested. Consumers can continue to utilize OLGC's Web sites without providing personal information however customized functionality will not be available. 
  * In addition to registration for services at OLGC Web sites, OLGC will ask you for other personal information when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion offered through an OLGC Web site. 
  * If you contact the OLGC by email, we will keep a record of that correspondence, but only so that we may respond to the email.
