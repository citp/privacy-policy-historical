	<p>Last updated April, 2011</p>
	<p>OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY.</p>
	<p>We realize the sensitive nature of the information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy describes how Prosper, Inc. ("Company" or "we") collects, uses and disseminates information about users ("you") of this website ("website" or "site") that we collect online. By using this website, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, immediately cease your access to or your use of this site.

To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@prospering.com">privacy@prospering.com</a> or write us at: Prosper, Inc. Attn: Privacy Department 5252 N.

Within thirty (30) days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph.</p>

	<p>1.1 Survey Information. The Company collects information about you when you voluntarily complete a Company survey, order form, registration page or other online request form, (collectively, a "Survey").

You may receive incentives from the Company or third-party partners in exchange for providing Survey Information to the Company. If a login or password is generated, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login and password information.  You are fully responsible for all activities that occur through your login and we reserve the right to refuse access to anyone at any time without notice for any reason.</p>
	<p>1.2 Voluntary Reference Information. You may be invited to provide contact information of others who you believe would be interested in this website and/or receiving additional information about products and services offered by the Company or its affiliates. You may be invited to voluntarily provide such contact information as the name, e-mail address, or telephone number of such referred individuals.

You agree to only provide reference information of those who you know personally and who you believe may have interest in the Company's products and/or services, and agree not provide reference information for any improper purpose such as to harass or to disclose otherwise private information. By voluntarily providing reference information you also grant the Company permission to disclose the circumstances surrounding how it obtained, the personal contact information of such individuals in order to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, and agree to be responsible for any liability associated with any improper or unauthorized disclosure. </p>
	<p>1.3 Third-Party List Information.

Additionally, the Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). As a result, Company strongly encourages you to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.  Your use of this website is your acceptance of such information gathering. </p>

A web bug, web beacon, or action tag is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate your information with previously acquired information about you in another database. The Company contracts with online partners to help manage and optimize its Internet business and communications. It uses the services of marketing companies to help us measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how you use our site. To do this, it uses web beacons, cookies and other technology provided by marketing companies on this site.

By supplementing our record with this information, we learn about the pages that are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customer, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although marketing companies may log the information coming from its site on its behalf, the Company controls how that data may and may not be used.
