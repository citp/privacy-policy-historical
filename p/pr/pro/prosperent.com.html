<p>Welcome to Prosperent (hereinafter "Prosperent", "we", or "us"). This privacy policy discloses the privacy
practices for Prosperent's websites and domains.</p>
<p>Our mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this
website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices.</p>
<p>
<strong>This website will notify you of the following:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information ("<span class="bi">PII</span>") of yours is collected from you through the website;
</li>
<li>The organization collecting the information;</li>
<li>How the information is used;</li>
<li>With whom the information may be shared;</li>
<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information;</li>
<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Prosperent's
control; and</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact Prosperent by email to privacy@prosperent.com. If you do not
receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact Prosperent by mail
at
3200 Brighton Blvd, Suite 112
Denver, CO
80216 . If you are not a member of Prosperent (an advertiser or affiliate who has registered with Prosperent to do business with Prosperent)
please see our <a href="/privacy/prosperads">Prosperent Privacy Policy for ProsperAds</a>.
</p>
<h3>Information collection and use</h3>
<p>
Prosperent is an owner of the information collected on this site. Information collected is in two distinct categories: Member
information and aggregated Web User information. This portion of Prosperent's privacy policy applies only to Members of Prosperent. For
web user privacy issues regarding the serving of advertisements and the use of cookies, please see the <a href="/privacy/prosperads">Prosperent Privacy Policy for ProsperAds</a>.
</p>
<p>Members of the Prosperent Network include affiliates and advertisers involved in advertising transactions. Member information collected
includes PII that is necessary to conduct business, such as name, phone number, email address, social security number, and/or tax ID
number. Payments made to and from Prosperent require the provision of and certain collection of PII that may include bank account
information and credit card numbers. Phone numbers may be used to contact Members for sales or inventory acquisition purposes. All
Member information is collected, modified (as needed) and stored in a password protected environment. This information is used for
service, media delivery, contact, billing and accounts payable purposes. We will not sell, share (except as provided for herein), or
rent this information to non-Prosperent entities. All Member information collection is explicit, voluntary, and manually entered by the
Member.</p>
<p>"Cookies" are files (e.g. flash browser objects or http header) that are stored on your web-enabled client (such as your web browser).
There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive
or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Prosperent does not and cannot use Cookies or
web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web
advertisements. When a consumer responds to or views an Internet advertisement served by Prosperent (such as through third-party Web
sites or email solicitation) or visits a Prosperent Network site, we send a Cookie and/or gif file to assign an anonymous, unique
identifier to the end user's Internet browser. One function of these Cookies is to provide Prosperent with information for the purpose
of paying third-parties commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase on an advertiser's Web
site. If the Internet user re-visits the advertiser's site directly, Prosperent is able to continue to track the user's activities
(excluding PII) on the advertiser's site and reward the third-party Web site that referred the user. We may use Cookies to estimate the
total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the
composition of the audience they reach. Cookies may also be used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser,
and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also may use Internet browsing and online purchase
data associated with an anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the end user's needs and interests. We
reserve the right to retain all ad delivery and reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes.
Cookies are also used to simplify Member login and to facilitate secure navigation through the password protected areas of the website.
Cookies may also be used to optimize and personalize the member's experience and allow Prosperent to monitor log ins and site traffic
patterns. Members who choose to reject all cookies will have difficulty or no success navigating the password protected areas of the
website.</p>
<p>We record the IP address of members at each login, and this information is part of a secure database and is password protected.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Sharing.</strong> Member information is not shared with any third party outside Prosperent and its affiliated
companies, except with your consent or as expressly provided for herein or for that necessary to conduct business, such as clearing a
credit card transaction for an advertising campaign purchase or making an ACH direct deposit to pay a Affiliate or as required by law.
Prosperent may provide email address and basic account data to an Advertiser or Affiliate to facilitate a potential or continued working
relationship between the Advertiser and Affiliate or for compliance matters. Once an affiliation is established, Advertiser and
Affiliate (or their agents or other third parties as designated by a Member) are privy to their respective campaign information and PII,
including anonymous Internet user transaction data for Internet users referred by Affiliate and any other information that a Member may
instruct Prosperent to disclose. The security of Member information is crucial to our success in the highly competitive field of online
advertising. Prosperent may, from time to time, use "gallery" pages to identify Affiliates and Advertisers by business identity ONLY. In
the event that Prosperent is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to
transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In
the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is
treated, transferred, or used.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Links.</strong> This website may contain links to other parties' websites. Please be aware that Prosperent is not responsible
for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy
policies of each and every website that collects PII. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Security.</strong> This website employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is
stored on our servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. We have an internal security policy
with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to employees, or third parties who have a need to
know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering our products and services by means of user login and password
requirements. We routinely evaluate our data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.
</p>
<p>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the
control of Prosperent to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII,
Prosperent cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when
communicating with a Prosperent Network company.</p>
<p>
<strong>Special Offers.</strong> Our Member email list is used for administrative and business purposes only. We send all new Members a
welcoming email. Special offers and promotions may be made at the website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Site and Service Updates.</strong> We may send Members website and service announcement updates by email. Members are not able
to un-subscribe from service announcements because they contain important information about the service. We communicate with Members to
provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Correcting/Updating Personal Information.</strong> If a Member's PII changes (such as his/her email address), the Member should
correct and update his/her information in the Prosperent Member area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Notification of Changes.</strong> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changed privacy policy and make it
accessible on this site along with the date such privacy policy was last updated so our Members are always aware of what information we
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
</p>
<h3>Data Processing/Safe Harbor</h3>
<p>
The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from US laws. To reconcile these differences,
the US and the EU have created a Safe Harbor that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. For more information see <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor.</a>
</p>
<p>By providing information to us, you acknowledge that we operate in the United States and agree to (i) permit us to transmit and use your
information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to effect the services and transactions provided by this
Site; and (ii) that such use by us shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy and applicable Terms and
Conditions and Policies.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
<span class="upper">You understand and agree that any dispute over privacy is subject to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy
and applicable terms and conditions</span>. You also agree that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third
party individuals whose personal data you supply to us with regard to: (a) the purposes for which such third party's personal data has
been collected; (b) the intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data; (c) which of the third
party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary; and (d) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the
data held about him/her. It is the express will of the parties that this agreement and all related documents have been drawn up in
English . C'est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s'y rattachent soient rédigés en
anglais.
