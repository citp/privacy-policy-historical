## How we use information we collect

We collect different information depending on which Products you use, how you choose to use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us about how that information is used. Here are specific purposes in which we use information we collect about you:

 **To deliver our Products to you:** We use information we collect about you in order to provide our Products to you. This may include using your email address to authenticate you when you sign up and/or log in, to process billing transactions for your account, to deliver customer success, and to operate and maintain our Products. For example within our platform, we use the name and picture you might provide to identify you to other users of the platform. We may also use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience on our websites.

 **For customer support:** We will use your information to resolve product assistance requests, to analyze and address technical issues you encounter, and to repair and optimize our Products for you.

 **For service improvement, research and development:** We always strive to improve our Products and find new ways to make them better for you. We use generalized data to understand how people use our Products, as well as feedback communicated directly to us. This might be in order to identify trends, usage patterns, to troubleshoot issues, and to make improvement of our Products. We also test and evaluate Service speed and performance regularly to maintain optimum deliverability, as well as test and analyze new features or Products with some users in beta before delivering product changes to all users.

 **To communicate with you about our Products:** In order to deliver our Products to you, we use your contact information in order to send transactional communications via email and within our Products. This may include in order to confirm a subscription purchase or change, to alert you when a subscription is expiring or being canceled, in order to provide customer support, and to communicate with you about technical updates, product releases, administrative messages or security alerts. Depending on your alert or role and user settings, we send you email notifications when you or others interact on our Products, for example, when you are shared on a project or task, or if you are communicating with others on a discussion thread. We also send you Products communications to help you onboard and engage with a particular Service in order to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of our Products and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. When an opt out is available, you will find that option (such as an unsubscribe link) within the communication itself or via your account or alerts settings.

 **To market, promote, and drive engagement with our Products:** We use your contact information and data related to how you use our Products to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying ProjectManager ads on other websites, platforms and applications, such as Facebook and Google. These communication mechanisms are used to promote engagement and to help you get the most out of our Products, and they may include news about new features, requests for reviews or feedback, survey requests, and informational email newsletters. We may also communicate with you about product promotions, offers and contests. You can decide whether you want to receive these communications as described below under “Opt-out of communications.”

 **For safety and security:** As part of our security protocols, we use information about you and your Products in several different ways.

Therefore we only collect and use your information:

  * In order to deliver to you our Products, including operating our Products, providing customer support, and to protect the security of our Products;
  * In order to satisfy a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to protect our legal rights and interests, or for research and development, or to promote and market our Products;
  * When we need to process your information in order to comply with legal obligations; or
  * When you give us consent to do so for specific purposes.



Where we use your information because we or a third party (such as your employer) have a legitimate interest in order to do so, you have the right to object to such use, however this may mean no longer using our Products. When and if you consent to our use of your information for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, however, this will not impact any processing that has already occurred.

For example, when you join an account, project or a team, your contact information may be displayed in a contact list for other team members so they can find and interact with you.
