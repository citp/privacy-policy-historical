# Privacy Policy

Project Manager Online Ltd is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information of individuals and companies we deal with.

### Information gathered on this website

When you browse, read or download information from our website our system may log these movements. These website logs are not personally identifiable and are purely statistical. The statistical information we collect comes from monitoring the website using 'cookies', in order to identify user trends which assist us in improving the service to you.

### How we use your personal information

We use your personal information to correspond with you, and to process your requests for our services. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any other organizations or companies, without first obtaining your consent, unless required to do so by law. We may disclose the information to our subsidiaries or partner companies that help us provide services to you. We may disclose this information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. If necessary, we may use this information to investigate, prevent, or take action against illegal activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to safety and security, violations of our Terms of Use, or otherwise. We may be required to transfer personal information if we are acquired by or merged with another company. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as bankruptcy courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission.

### Accuracy of personal information

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information we hold is as accurate as is possible. You have the right to contact us at any time and ask for its correction if you feel the personal information we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete. In normal circumstances we would correct that information. If we do not, you are entitled to request that we attach to that information a statement provided by you of the correction requested but not made.

### Security of personal information

We use strict security procedures and technology to protect any personal information we hold. We have procedures in place to prevent loss, unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse of your personal information. If another organization supports our hosting platform, then we will require them to appropriately safeguard the privacy of any personal information held.

If you have registered login access to secure parts of this service, then your account information will be password protected. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. To further protect your personal information, your login time will automatically expire after a specified period of inactivity. We will permanently delete personal information that is no longer required by us.

Please note that email correspondence is not encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information. You also should be aware of the limitations of security, authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in connection with the internet in general and that any information you transmit across the internet has a remote chance of being damaged, corrupted, "sniffed" and/or accessed by another person without permission, however unlikely that may be.

### Accessing your personal information

You have the right to request access to your information. We will usually give you full access to your personal information but, in some cases there may be legal, technical, or administrative reasons that prevent your access. If we deny access then we will inform you of the reasons why. Please contact us if you would like to know more about how you can access or update your personal information.

### Changes to Privacy Policy

We may occasionally change this Privacy Policy. If we do, we will post the changes on the website. The changes will take effect as soon as they are posted.
