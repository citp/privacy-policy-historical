# Myspace Tracker - Profile Tracking by ProfileSnitch.com

**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive. We do not intend to collect any personal information from children under 13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. Please see below for our policy with respect to children under 13. 

**General**

ProfileSnitch.com is a [MySpace Tracker](http://www.profilesnitch.com/about-myspace-trackers.php) site, which records visitor information on your MySpace profile by way of inserting special html codes in your MySpace profile. If you are unclear what a MySpace tracker is, please [follow this link](http://www.profilesnitch.com/about-myspace-trackers.php) for a full, no non-sense explanation. 

We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post comments, enter a contest, order products, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of our site. If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas that require personal identification. 

If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information with other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, if you register with our site or purchase products you may automatically receive e-mails confirming your registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below. 

**Use of Services**

ProfileSnitch.com makes no gauranatees to its tracking service, and by using our service the end user agrees that all liability and risk lies at their own expense. While we strive to offer a quality tracking service, we make no assurances regarding uptime, availability, functionality, etc. Lifetime and premium monthly membership subscribers agree not to hold ProfileSnitch liable for any amount for failing to provide the service. By using the service, you understand that MySpace may render the service useless by way of blocking ProfileSnitch, or by making modifications to its own system that renders ProfileSnitch's tracking ability useless. By using our service you agree to assume this risk and further agree not to hold ProfileSnitch liable for any stoppages in the service due to MySpace or any other reason. ProfileSnitch is in no way related to or affiliated with Myspace, and is not a sanctioned service of MySpace. 

**Use of Information**

When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname selected by you and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information. This e-mail, nickname and password should not be your MySpace user identity or related to your MySpace user identity in anyway. We will never ask for your MySpace e-mail and password. 

We may use an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order (including e-mail) may be used to deliver digital products and information. We may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise and products, including software. 

We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest or promotion terms. 

All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection is made from. These IP addresses are used to determine your city location for the purposes of tracking for other ProfileSnitch members. By using ProfileSnitch you agree to have other ProfileSnitch members see your IP address, and thus reveal your city location and your MySpace profile Id.

Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party digital rights management systems (DRMS) which may allow for communication between your software and the third party and utilize security features (e.g., preventing distribution of or access to the applications in the event of unauthorized use).

For reasons such as improving member experience and providing customized communications to our users, we may receive information about you from third party sources and our web logs and add it to the information that we have received from you. Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include e-mail addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP address. 

**Information Sharing**

We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have “opted-in?to such sharing.

In addition, if you opt-out, we may share that information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you. 

However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety. 

We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time to time.

**Children Under 13**

Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites that ask for age, we do not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted under COPPA. 

If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to we, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding web logs, and below regarding archived information). 

We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission. 

**Other**

We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database.
