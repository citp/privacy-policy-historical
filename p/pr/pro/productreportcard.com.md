**How does ProductReportCard.com protect my information?**

We have implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personally identifiable information. Users' personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by certain key employees. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Will ProductReportCard.com disclose the information it collects to others?**

ProductReportCard.com will require all recipients of such information to maintain the information as confidential, use the information for the limited and intended purpose and agree not to disclose such information.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action in conjunction with illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ProductReportCard.com's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law;
  * We are required by law to provide the IRS with Tax ID numbers and/or other personally identifiable information about Affiliates and Writers who receive over $600 in payments from ProductReportCard.com in a calender year.
