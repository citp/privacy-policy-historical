### The information we collect about you

The Funds collect non-public personal information from various sources. For instance, account applications may include name, address, and social security number. The Funds receive information from transactions in your accounts, including account balances, and from correspondence between you and the Funds or third parties, such as the Fund’s service providers. The Funds use such information provided by you or your representative to process transactions, to respond to inquiries from you, to deliver reports, products, and services, and to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. 

### How we handle your personal information

For example, sharing information with non-affiliated third parties that maintain or service customer accounts for the Funds is essential. The Funds may also share information with companies that perform administrative or marketing services for the Funds including research firms. When the Funds enter into such a relationship, such third parties’ use of customers’ information is restricted and they are prohibited from sharing it or using it for any purposes other than those for which they were hired. The Funds also require service providers to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard non-public personal information of customers of the Funds.

### How we safeguard your personal information

The Funds maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. Within the Funds, access to personal information is restricted to those employees who require access to that information in order to provide products or services to our customers such as processing transactions and handling inquiries. The Fund’s employment policies restrict the use of customer information and require that it be held in strict confidence.

The Funds will adhere to the policies and practices described in this notice for both current and former customers of the Funds.
