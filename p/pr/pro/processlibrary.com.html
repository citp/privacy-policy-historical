				<p><strong>User communications.</strong></p><p> When you download and run the ProcessScanner Software it will communicate with ProcessLibrary.com. This communication includes information gathered by the software regarding your computer's process information and activity. This information does not include personal information (such as the contents of personal documents, web browsing history or cookies). We may retain this communication in order to provide statistics, process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. All gathered data is anonymized and no personal details are retained. Scans are only identifiable by a scan number displayed in the results page. </p>
				<p>ProcessLibrary.com processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We only process personal information to provide our own services.</p>
				<p><strong>Choices for personal information</strong></p>
				<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
				<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
				<p><strong>Information sharing</strong></p>
				<p>ProcessLibrary.com only shares personal information with other commercial projects from Uniblue Systems Ltd. upon obtaining the user's consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any personal information.</p>
				<p><strong>Information security</strong></p>
				<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
				<p>We restrict access to personal information to Uniblue Systems Ltd. employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
				<p><strong>Data integrity</strong></p>
				<p>ProcessLibrary.com processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
				<p><strong>Accessing and updating personal information</strong></p>
				<p>When you use ProcessLibrary.com services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Users can access and or modify their details by visiting 'My Account'.</p>
				<p><strong>Changes to this policy</strong></p>
				<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).
