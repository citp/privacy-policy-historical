						<h2><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Western Producer Privacy Policy</font></h2>
					</center>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
Western Producer
Publications views customer information, including name and address
information, as a proprietary trade secret. We have very strict policies
designed to protect such personal information.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
We do occasionally share
names and addresses with reputable third parties, but do so under strict
guidelines. We honour "do not share" share requests. Any form with
which we collect personal information contains a "do not share"
option. If personal information is collected without such an option being
present, then the information collected is considered not for sharing. Where a
person has completed more than one form, and where one has a do not share
request and others do not, we rely on the most recently completed form. In
other words, we try to do whatever you most recently have told us to do.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
While we occasionally share
name and address information, we are committed to the following policies:</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>1.</b> We will not share phone numbers with anyone.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>2.</b> We will not share email addresses with anyone.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>3.</b> We will not honour
"confidentiality agreements" that require us to keep secret from our
customers how their name and address have been shared. If you ask us if we have
shared your name with a business or organization, we will tell the truth.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>4.</b> We will not share even
the name and address of anyone who has asked us not to do so.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>5.</b> We will not share
information with anyone whose legitimacy is not clear in our own minds.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>6.</b> Because they are not
subject to Canadian privacy laws or practices, Western Producer Publications
will not share any personal customer information with non-Canadian persons or
businesses.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>7.</b> Membership information
may be collected but will never be disclosed.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>NOTE:</b> By their nature some
promotions require that we share your information. For example, if we have a
sponsored contest, we must share your information with the sponsors so that you
are able to receive your prize. If such sharing involves more than name,
address and phone number, we will explicitly say so in the contest rules.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
</font></p><h3><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What information do we collect?</font></h3><p></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
We collect four kinds of personal information:</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>1.</b> Information necessary
for the normal conduct of business. We must have customers' names, addresses
and phone numbers to provide service. We must have credit information for those
who require credit, including credit numbers for those using them to purchase
our services. We must know if a customer is an agricultural producer, a
business or other in order to provide the specific services we offer. We use
customer phone numbers as a unique identifier to avoid duplicating accounts.
The phone number is so important to our business operation that we make a
complete commitment to never share phone numbers from the customer file with
any third party for any reason.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>2.</b> Information helpful in
the conduct of business. We ask a great many questions of customers in the
course our relationship. These questions include, for <i>The Western Producer</i>, what kinds of crops they grow or
livestock they raise. For <i>Acreage Life</i>, we ask about interests and hobbies related to the acreage. We also on occasion ask about details of producers' operations such as input costs. As set out below, the primary use of this information is in the development and management of our own publications and services. WE NEVER SHARE ANY PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION provided to us by subscribers in response to such questions.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>3.</b> "Byproduct
information." We obtain some personal information as a byproduct of other
activities. An example would be when an advertiser provides us a list of their
customers so that we may mail a special offer or do a match
("merge-purge") against our own list to eliminate duplication. Our
purpose is to deliver something on behalf of a customer, and as a byproduct of doing
that we end up with names and addresses. Byproduct information is NOT
maintained. Personal information received from third parties is destroyed as
soon as the purpose for which we received it has been served. So, in the
example where an advertiser wants an insert to be placed in the newspapers only
of its own customers, once we have completed the necessary merge-purge and
successfully delivered the insert, that customer file is destroyed.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>4.</b> Internet operation
information. This is information that we may obtain for the purpose of
operating our internet web site. We may use cookies to store your preferences
or ease your access. For example, if we design a web page for the exclusive use
of subscribers, we would have to implement password protection. To make it easier
for you to log on, we could store your name and password in a cookie on your
computer. Note that cookies are NOT required to use our web site but are
available for your convenience only. We do not maintain any file of information
on your particular use of our web site and we do not provide such information
to any one else. We do aggregate usage information to ensure we know what parts
of the site are being used. We require legitimate email addresses as a
condition of participation in or access to a number of internet features. We
commit never to share email addresses obtained in this way.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
</font></p><h3><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">How do we use the information we collect?</font></h3><p></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>1.</b> Our primary use of the
information we collect is for internal business purposes. For example, it is
very important that we have current, complete and accurate addresses and phone
numbers so that we may properly deliver the services for which our customers
pay. As well, it is important for us to know the kinds of agricultural
activities our subscribers engage in so that we can ensure we are fully meeting
their information needs.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
An example is the addition
of the Livestock special section to the weekly newspaper. Our information
gathering demonstrated that we had a large and active livestock readership.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>2.</b> We may use the
information we collect to contact you ourselves. We frequently contact
subscribers and advertisers for a variety of reasons, including conducting
surveys, testing the quality of our service and to encourage customers to renew
their accounts.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>3.</b> We may employ a third
party to contact subscribers or advertisers for the purposes described above.
We have a regular market research program that involves employing independent
firms to survey agricultural producers, including non-customers. It is
important for us to use outside firms so that we can be confident the
information we receive is reliable. It also allows subscribers to be confident
that their answers are confidential. When we use outside firms for research,
subscriber identities are not revealed with their responses so respondents can
be fully frank in their answers.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>4.</b> We also use outside
suppliers to assist in obtaining customer orders and renewals. These suppliers
are contractually committed to keeping your personal information protected and
are prohibited from sharing this information with anyone. As these firms are
acting as our agents, we do not view this as sharing your information. Our
agents, including our subscriptions and advertising contractors, are bound to
return any paper forms of customer information and to destroy any electronic
forms, once the purpose of their possession of the information has been served.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
<b>5.</b> We may use the
aggregated information we collect in news stories, promotional materials or
other activities. "Aggregated" means the information from many
individuals is added together, for example as in the statement "There are
27,000 Western Producer subscribers who report raising livestock." No
individual is identified in such stories or promotional materials.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
</font></p><h3><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employee Information</font></h3><p></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
Personal information about
employees of Western Producer Publications is held in strict confidence. We
collect only such employee information as is required for employment purposes.
Information for workplace-related social activities may be gathered by the
employee social committee, including things like birthdays. Due to their
workplace context, such activities are subject to privacy protection under this
policy and the information collected may only be used for the purpose intended
and agreed to by the affected employees. Employee information is not shared
with third parties except as provided by law and in the due intended course of
business, including for example, exchanges related to the employee union.
Information about an employee may be held as confidential from the employee if
the information also includes or serves to divulge third-party information of a
private, commercial or confidential nature. Except as required by applicable
law, nothing in this policy is intended to prevent the withholding of any
information from employees where such is deemed to be in the interest of the
company.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
</font></p><h3><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Are there exceptions?</font></h3><p></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
We do not have exceptions
to the policies detailed above, except as compelled by law. However, there are
circumstances that do not fall within this policy of which you should be aware.
For example, while we commit not to share phone numbers we cannot prevent the
use of the publicly distributed phone books. We ourselves have used public
directories of phone numbers to compile lists for the purpose of making subscriptions
sales. To the extent that the practice remains acceptable, we must make use of
it in our competitive industry. It is important to be clear that our privacy
policy applies only to personal information we ourselves collect directly and
indirectly from our own customers. If we use third-party sources we rely upon
those sources for the permissibility of using the list. Note however, that we
will always disclose such sources on request of any person contacted through
them. </font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
Notwithstanding this policy,
the company reserves the right to withhold any information from anyone where it
is both in the interest of the company to withhold and not inconsistent with
applicable law. In other words, circumstances could arise where we feel we have
to keep certain information secret and if that happens and the law allows us
to, we will keep it secret. Such a situation has never arisen and may never
arise. We include this statement only to ensure you understand that there are
no absolutes and care should be exercised in understanding the coverage of all
privacy policies, including ours.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">
Western Producer
Publications privacy policy exceeds the standards set by government and
industry. Should you observe a gap in this policy or its practice, please
contact us immediately.</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">



<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Western Producer Publications is committed to promptly dealing with any complaints or concerns in regard to privacy issues. Your may also review and request corrections to personal information Western Producer Publications has in its files. Federal privacy laws require such requests to be in writing. This avoids strangers making requests in your name. You may write to Data Marketing Administrator, PO Box 2500, Saskatoon, SK, S7K 2C4. You should include your Western Producer account number and your complete name, address and phone number for identification purposes.</font></p></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></td>
