_Effective Date: 20 December 2017_

 **comScore, Inc. (“comScore”, “we”, “us” or “our”) interacts with current and prospective clients, investors, and the general public via its Website, comscore.com (“Website”), and its mobile application. This Privacy Policy describes comScore’s practices as they relate to the collection, use, and disclosure of information gathered from visitors to the Website and application that link to this policy. comScore operates a number of research panels, each of which is governed by the privacy policy that appears on the Website assigned to that research panel.**

#### What information is collected?  

 **Personal Information**.  comScore collects Personal Information about you when you choose to provide such information to us. For example, you may provide us with Personal Information when you submit an online form, apply for a job, communicate with us by e-mail, or access client-specific content. This information may include your name; business or personal contact information, such as your address, email address or phone number; and any information that you provide as part of a job application (collectively, “Personal Information”).

 **Data Collected Automatically.   **We automatically collect certain information about your use of our Website and application. This information may include, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version, your device identifier, information about your computer and operating system, the length of your visit and the pages that you viewed on our Website or application. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect this information. We also use cookies and similar technologies for other purposes such as to ensure authorized access to client-specific content, and to track client access to such content. Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user’s hard drive that contain information about a user. Please note that you may be able to view and delete these cookies using the features of your browser; however, deleting cookies may prevent you from being able to use the full functionality of the Website.

Our Website and application also automatically create logs regarding your activity on our Website. These logs may identify the features that you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you access. We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our Website and application and to better understand your priorities and interests.

 **Information Collected by Third Parties.   **We may permit third parties to use cookies or other technology to collect information about your online and application usage activities across our Website and application and other websites and applications over time for non-advertising purposes such as to help us analyze how visitors use our Website and application. We may use Google’s analytics products to provide these services. To learn more about how these Google products collect and process data and the choices Google may offer to control these activities, you may visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

 **Information Collected for Market Research.   **This Website may set tags on your browser that collect data for the ScorecardResearch service, a service offered by Full Circle Studies, Inc. (“Full Circle Studies”) which is also part of the comScore market research group. You may control your level of participation in ScorecardResearch’s market research programs by visiting here: [http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx.](http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx "ScoreCard Research") We will continue to count the fact that a browser came to a site, but we will not associate that event with your browser. Additionally, if your mobile device platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in our market research programs with respect to our data collection from applications on that mobile device.

Please note that this opt-out is cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out). If you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective. Additionally, because different computers and different Internet browsers all require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you need to perform this opt-out process on any computer and browsers that you want to be opted-out.

#### How to opt out of interest-based advertising

We may partner with third-party companies that may use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your visits to our Website and application and other non-affiliated websites and applications over time, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, in order to provide you with more relevant advertisements.  

This practice is called interest-based advertising. You may visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) to learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising on your web browser by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. If you wish to opt-out of interest based advertising in mobile applications on your device by companies that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices application, you may download that application onto your device and exercise your choice. AppChoices is available at the links below:

You may also be able to limit data collection by third parties across applications by using your mobile device settings. Please note that opting out will not stop advertising from appearing on your browser or mobile device. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, please note that if you use a different browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, restrict cookies from being used on your browser, or reset your mobile device’s platform advertising ID, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.
