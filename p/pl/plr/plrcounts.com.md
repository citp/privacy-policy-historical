# Privacy Policy

Count On Us, LLC, is a registered Oklahoma Limited Liability Company who takes the job of guarding your personal information with the utmost seriousness.

We will not give any information about you to others without your express permission. Our network of sites uses forms in which you give us contact information (your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, etc.) so you can receive information from us or to place orders with us. We use your customer information only when it will be important for us to contact you regarding updates or changes to our programs or products and special offers we think you'll find valuable. We also will send you information related to the topics you signed up about to further help in the education process. 

At all times if you find that you wish to stop receiving communication from us, simply click on UNSUBSCRIBE at the bottom of any newsletter that you are a part of. Understand that from time to time you may end up subscribing to several different specialized newsletters that we offer, so you may still continue to receive messages from us, just through a different newsletter. If you are having issues unsubscribing simply send an e-mail to info@countonusllc.com, and we will assist you. 

We use information gathered about you from our site statistics (for example your IP address ) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.

We may also need to give out your information if one of our partners requires it, but these situations are rare.
