We request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

While making a purchase from PLNDR.com, you are given the option to create a user name and password. This user name and password functionality offers our customers the ability to quickly and easily proceed through the check out process on repeat visits. We do not store your credit card information as part of this optional service. There is also the option to receive our Email Newsletter updates. If you choose to receive these you should expect weekly HTML newsletter content to arrive at the email address you provided with your purchase.

**Surveys or Contests**

PLNDR often provides you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes and to send participants our HTML email newsletter.

We sometimes run contests in conjunction with other websites or services. When we do so, any information you provide as a result of entering the contest or survey may also be provided to the affiliate but such practices will always be clearly marked at the point of entry. 

**Tell-A-Friend**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. Your friend will also be subscribed to our weekly HTML email newsletter. Your friend may contact us at [www.plndr.com/plndr/membersonly/unsubscribe.aspx](https://www.plndr.com/plndr/membersonly/unsubscribe.aspx) to request that we remove their email address from our database.
