# PLTW | PRIVACY POLICY OVERVIEW

**PLTW.org Privacy Policy**

 **Introduction** This website (the “Site”) has been developed as part of the charitable and educational activities of Project Lead The Way, Inc. (“PLTW”) to assist and support educational institutions in providing students with quality, effective science, technology engineering and math (“STEM”) curriculum and to promote STEM education. It is the intent of PLTW to comply in all material respects with all applicable privacy laws, and we are strongly committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Please carefully read this policy before using the Site and providing any information through the Site.

 **User Consent to Privacy Policy** Any person accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Site, either manually or via an automated device or program, shall be considered a "User." All Users are bound by the terms of this privacy policy and PLTW’s [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.pltw.org/terms-service-overview). Users consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable user information and anonymous browsing information (collectively "information") to the extent not prohibited by law. If you do not consent to this policy, please do not access, browse, or use this Site.

 **Registration** **Procedures and Information Provided** Certain portions of the Site are only accessible to registered users, and such access is subject to additional terms and conditions available through the registration process.

 **Personal Information** PLTW collects personal information in the registration processes described above or from Users who voluntarily provide such information in order to participate in numerous services and activities available free of charge on the Site. For example, Users may elect to complete an online profile, to communicate with other Users via email and other mediums, or to take advantage of other services through the Site. This list is not exhaustive as certain information is gathered automatically when you use the Site and you may provide additional information voluntarily when using the Site. Anonymous browsing information, aggregated data or other information which does not contain any personally identifiable information may be used by PLTW for quality assurance, improvement, marketing and other similar activities.

 **Disclosure of Information to Third Parties** PLTW may share information that it collects or receives regarding its Users with third parties as required for the operation of the Site, enforcement of the terms of use or privacy policy for the Site, or as permitted by law. In most circumstances, information is shared only at the request of a User, to process a request for a User, or to provide a service to a User. If PLTW will share information with a third party, it will implement measures to have the third party keep this information secure and confidential. PLTW complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission, and other applicable online privacy laws.

 **Cookies** A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. The Site, and the portal and platforms on the Site, use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. The session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period. You may remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.  
A persistent cookie is set to store your User Name and Password, so you do not have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable the ability for the Site to track and target the interests of a user in order to enhance the experience of the user on the Site.  
If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site, may be limited.  
Linked Internet Websites This Site may provide hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document, that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or may take you to a third party website not controlled by PLTW. Any hyperlinked third party websites may collect, use, and disclose information in a manner different than the Site. PLTW is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these websites and expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.

 **Chat Rooms, Journals and WebLogs, Message Boards, Classifieds, and Public Forums** These areas are only available to eligible and registered users. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to journals, weblogs, message boards, classifieds, or any other public forum, then that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. You should use discretion in providing information in these areas. PLTW is not responsible for the review, collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through such public forums and expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.

PLTW does not share any information with third parties except as stated above, as required by law, as needed to protect the rights of others, or to enforce the terms of use for the Site.

 **Amendments to Policy** PLTW reserves the right to amend this policy periodically. Any amendments made to this policy will be considered effective immediately after the amended policy is posted on the Site.

 **Contacting Us** If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact us at [schoolsupport@pltw.org](mailto:schoolsupport@pltw.org).
