Last Updated: October 2009 Project Lead The Way, Inc. (“PLTW”) is committed to safeguarding the personal details of users and Members of this website (“Site”), in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. By using services provided by this Site (“Services”), you agree to the collection and use of your information by PLTW in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

PLTW may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check back here periodically for updates. 1\. Types of Information Collected PLTW may collect personal information that you supply when you sign up for an account to become a Member or otherwise communicate with the Site. Such personal information includes your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address. PLTW may also automatically collect nonpersonal information from users of the Site, such as the IP address of the computer through which the users access the Site, the physical location of that IP address, and the type of web browser being used to access the Site. PLTW may also place a “cookie” on your hard drive when you access the Site. A cookie is a small piece of data that collects information about how you use the Site, what pages are viewed, and what information is accessed. PLTW uses this nonpersonal information to understand users’ needs and most effectively administer the Site and Services in response to those needs. This Site is directed to and intended for use by adults only. PLTW requires that a user be at least 18 years of age or older to submit personally identifiable information. As such, PLTW does not knowingly collect or distribute any personally identifiable information from minors through the Site. 2\. Use of Information Collected PLTW will not sell or share Members’ personal information with unrelated third parties, partners, or affiliates unless the Member consents to the disclosure, or except as may be required by law, governmental authority, or to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT IF YOU BECOME A MEMBER OF THE SITE AND POST A MESSAGE ON A BULLETIN BOARD, CHAT ROOM, FORUM, AND/OR OTHER COMMUNITY AREA ON THE SITE, YOU AGREE AND CONSENT TO THE DISPLAY OF YOUR USER NAME AND E-MAIL AND/OR PHONE NUMBER ALONG WITH YOUR POSTING. NO OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED. This limited disclosure of personal information is to facilitate the dissemination of information about and experiences with PLTW. Users may wish to contact the Member behind a post directly to seek more information or clarification about a post. Any additional information a Member puts in a post becomes public information which can be viewed by any user of the Site. Thus, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal, financial, or other types of sensitive information in the publicly accessible areas of the Site. You use such community functions at your own risk. PLTW may combine your usage information for the Site and Services with that of other users to determine which areas of the Site and which Services are most popular. By collecting and analyzing this data, PLTW can improve the Site and Services. This "aggregate information" does not contain any of your personally identifiable information. 3\. Protection and Modification of Personal Information The protection of your personal information is important to PLTW, and PLTW will take reasonable measures to ensure its safekeeping. However, no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The personal information you provide to PLTW in your Member account is password protected, so only the Member can access or change the personal information. You should not share the password to your account with anybody. You are responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of the information in your account profile. You can update your personal information at any time by clicking on the “update profile” link when signed into your personal account. 4\.
