  * This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Plazes Service at <http://plazes.com/>
  * This privacy policy covers how Plazes treats personal information that Plazes collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.
  * Children under 18 are not permitted to use the Plazes service, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.

  * When you register we ask you only for your E-Mail address and a nickname (pseudonym).

  * Plazes automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser and the Plazes Launcher, including your IP address, ambiant technical data (your default gateway's MAC ID, GSM/3G cellId, Wifi access points MAC ID, GPS coordinates etc.), cookie, and the page you request.
  * Plazes uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.



### IP Addresses

IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our log files.
