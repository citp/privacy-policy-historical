6\. LAWFUL BASES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you are an individual in the European Union (EU) or an EU citizen, we collect and process data about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. This means we collect and process your data only when:

  * It is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your individual privacy interests), such as preventing fraud, improving the Website, and increasing the security of the Website and network infrastructure;
  * You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;
  * It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or
  * It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.



Where we rely on your consent to process your Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the information in the Contacts for Individual Rights Requests section.  Some examples of our legitimate interests and the information being processed include:

7\. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS

We make certain choices available to you when it comes to your Personal Information and any Device Information that can identify you (“Personal Data”).  Please review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them.  We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.  If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated on our progress. 

Review and update your data: You have the right to access and update any Personal Data that we have collected.  Some Personal Data, such as the account holder’s name and email address can be found and updated using the account management tools on our website. For any Personal Data beyond this, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.  We may request more information to confirm your identity before modifying any Personal Data.

After you delete your Personal Data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.  We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim. 

Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict how we process your Personal Data in certain circumstances.  This is often an alternative to requesting the complete deletion of your data.  Rather than requesting we delete all of your Personal Data, you may request that we limit our uses of your Personal Data to specific purposes.  You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your Personal Data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it.

If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request.  If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies.   If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.
