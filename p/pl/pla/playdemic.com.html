	<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>

	<p>Playdemic develops and publishes social games for the web and
	mobile devices including Gourmet Ranch and Crossword Buddies (the
	"Service"). In this policy, "Playdemic" refers to Playdemic Limited
	and its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent
	companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common
	ownership. We may also refer to Playdemic as "We" or "Us". This
	Privacy Policy describes:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
	<ul>
	<li>the information We collect, how We do so and the purposes of
	our collection</li>

	<li>how We use and with whom We share such information</li>

	<li>how you can access and update such information</li>

	<li>the choices you can make about how We collect, use and share
	your information</li>

	<li>how We protect the information We store about you<br>
	 &nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<p>If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy or our
	collection and use of information, please contact us as described
	in Section 14 ("Contact Us").</p>

	<p>If you access our games from a third party Social Networking
	Site ("SNS"), you may be required to also read and accept the SNS
	Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>2. Information We Collect</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Information about You Received from an SNS</strong></p>

	<p>When you use any Playdemic game at an SNS such as Facebook or
	Google +, where our games may also be referred to as
	"applications", you allow Playdemic to access certain information
	from your profile for that site. The information you allow
	Playdemic to access varies by game and SNS, and it is affected by
	the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. You can control and
	find out more about these settings at the SNS where you play our
	games. For example, Playdemic may access and store some or all of
	the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your
	preferences:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
	<ul>
	<li>your first and last name</li>

	<li>your profile picture or its URL</li>

	<li>your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available
	information such as name and profile photo</li>

	<li>the user ID numbers for your friends that are also connected to
	our game(s)</li>

	<li>the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you
	registered</li>

	<li>your physical location and that of your access devices</li>

	<li>your gender</li>

	<li>your birthday<br>
	 &nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<p>By playing a Playdemic game through an SNS, you are authorizing
	Playdemic to collect, store, and use in accordance with this
	Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS
	could provide to Playdemic through the SNS Application Programming
	Interface ("API"). Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or
	"allow" (or similar terms) one of our applications on an SNS.<br>
	 &nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Information We Collect from You Directly</strong></p>

	<p>When you interact with the Service (whether or not on an SNS),
	at www.Playdemic.com, or any Playdemic-owned website, We may
	collect and store information from you directly as described
	below:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Registration Information</strong></p>

	<p>We may allow you to "register" with Us by using Facebook Connect
	or other SNS authentication options to create an account or profile
	within the Service. We may also provide a more typical registration
	flow where you may be required to provide the following
	information: your age or birthday (for age screening and/or to
	better understand who our users are); your first and last names;
	your e-mail address; a password and other information that helps Us
	confirm that it is you accessing your account.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that
	is visible to other Playdemic users. Your user profile may include:
	a profile photo; one or more game username(s); your gender;
	biographic details that you provide; links to your profiles on
	various SNS; details about the games you play; and a Playdemic user
	ID number that is created by Playdemic and used to identify your
	profile.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The Playdemic user ID number used to identify your account and
	profile will be public and will appear in the URL of your profile
	page, but will only permit access to information that is considered
	public or that you have designated as public in your settings.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Your first and last names and profile picture are considered
	"public" on Playdemic websites that offer direct access to
	Playdemic games and search engines may index this publicly
	available information. When We offer profiles, We will also offer
	functionality that allows you to opt-out of public indexing of your
	public profile information.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may also offer you the ability to import your address book
	contacts or manually enter e-mail addresses so that you can (i)
	locate your contacts on Playdemic; and (ii) invite those contacts
	to join you in our games. We will store those contacts for purposes
	of helping you and your contacts make connections on our site. If
	you do not want your contacts stored just follow the instructions
	available at the "Learn More" link. Passwords provided to Playdemic
	for the purpose of accessing your address book will not be
	stored.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Information We Receive or Collect When You Access
	Playdemic Games on a Mobile Device.</strong></p>

	<p>If you play Playdemic games on your mobile telephone or other
	mobile device, including iPads and tablets, We collect your mobile
	device identifier and IP Address. In certain games We will create
	and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an
	account number. We may collect the name you have associated with
	your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other
	information you choose to provide, such as user name, character
	name, geo-location or e-mail address. We may also access your
	contacts to enable you to invite friends to join you in the
	Service.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>

	<p>If you purchase a license to use in-game virtual currency or
	virtual items directly from Playdemic, We will collect the billing
	and financial information necessary to process your charges, which
	may include your postal and e-mail addresses. Playdemic may also
	receive the billing and payment information that you provide when
	your purchase is processed by another party, such as Facebook (for
	Facebook Credits) or Apple (for purchases on iOS devices). Our <a href="/terms-of-service.aspx" title="Terms of Service">Terms of
	Service</a> explain our policies and terms relevant to our charges
	and billing practices. Please note that purchases of third party
	credits or currencies like Facebook Credits may also be subject to
	additional policies.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Customer Support Correspondence</strong></p>

	<p>When you ask for assistance from our <a href="http://support.playdemic.com/support/" target="_blank">Customer Support</a> team, We will collect and
	store the contact information you provide (generally your name and
	e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on
	the Service, and your user ID number. We will also store the
	correspondence and any information contained within.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>SMS Notifications, Push Notifications &amp; Local
	Notifications</strong></p>

	<p>We receive and store the information you provide, including your
	telephone number, when you sign up to have SMS notifications sent
	directly to your mobile phone. These messages notify you of in-game
	activity and may allow you to play the game from your phone. You
	can adjust the types of notifications you receive and when you
	receive them by editing your SMS notification settings; just log in
	to your game account and choose SMS mobile from the Help menu.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>With your consent We may send push notifications to your mobile
	device to provide game updates and other relevant messages. You can
	manage push notifications from the "options" or "settings" page
	within the relevant game. You may also be able to manage them from
	your device's settings page for the relevant game.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may send local notifications to your mobile device to provide
	game updates and other relevant information. You can manage local
	notifications from the "options" or "settings" page within the
	relevant game.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Technical and Usage Information</strong></p>

	<p>When you access our websites or play our games, We collect (i)
	certain technical information about your mobile device or computer
	system, including IP Address and mobile device ID; and (ii) usage
	statistics about your interactions with the Service. This
	information is typically collected through the use of server log
	files or web log files ("Log Files"), mobile device software
	development kits and tracking technologies like browser cookies to
	collect and analyze certain types of technical information. Some of
	the cookies the Service places on your computer are linked to your
	user ID number(s). For more information on how We utilize cookies
	and other tracking technologies please review the "Cookies and
	Automated Information Collection" portion of Section 3 ("How We
	Collect Information about You").</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>3. How We Collect Information about You</strong></p>

	<p>We may collect information about you in any one or more of the
	following ways:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Information about Players and Play</strong></p>

	<p>When you play one of our games, Playdemic collects and stores
	certain information that you provide directly or through the SNS or
	other third party website that is offering our game(s). To provide
	a richer game play and social experience, We also collect
	information about your play and interaction with other players and
	the Service. The bulk of this information is collected and stored
	through the use of Log Files, which are files on our web servers
	that record actions taken on our games and websites.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Communications Features</strong></p>

	<p>You may be able to take part in certain activities on our
	websites or games that give you the opportunity to communicate or
	share information not just with Playdemic, but also with other
	users of our Service. These include:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
	<ul>
	<li>participating in player forums and message boards</li>

	<li>posting public comments to other users' profiles or
	gameboards</li>

	<li>sending private messages or invitations to other users, either
	directly on our websites or to their e-mail accounts</li>

	<li>chat with other users</li>

	<li>posting photos<br>
	 &nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<p>We may record and store archives of these communications on
	Playdemic's servers to protect the safety and well being of our
	users and Playdemic's rights and property in connection with the
	service. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage
	of such communications for these purposes.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Cookies and Automated Information
	Collection</strong></p>

	<p>When you access the Service, We collect certain technical
	information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and
	services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii)
	manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf,
	such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and tracking technologies
	to collect and analyze certain types of technical information,
	including cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers,
	browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and
	URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing
	pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of
	time spent on particular pages, game state and the date and time of
	activity on our websites or games, and other similar information.
	In some cases, We will associate this information with your user ID
	number for our internal use.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons,
	which allow Us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an
	e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow Us to
	advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from
	certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new
	installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii)
	local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help Us to
	prevent fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load
	times.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place
	cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow.
	Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie
	management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash
	cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit
	<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/" target="_blank">adobe.com</a> and make changes at the privacy
	settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the
	features and functionality of playing our games, as Playdemic
	cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.
	Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our games
	or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and
	those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Other Sources</strong></p>

	<p>We may collect or receive information from other sources
	including (i) other Playdemic users who choose to upload their
	email contacts; and (ii) third party information providers. This
	information will be used to supplement your profile - primarily to
	help you and your friends connect. It will be combined with other
	information We collect.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>4. How We Use the Information We Collect</strong></p>

	<p>In general, We collect, store and use your information to
	provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized
	experience. For example, We may use information collected from you
	in any one or more of the following ways:<br>
	 &nbsp;</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
	<ul>
	<li>to create your game accounts and allow play of our games</li>

	<li>to identify and suggest connections with other Playdemic
	users</li>

	<li>to enable user-to-user communications</li>

	<li>to provide technical support and respond to user inquiries</li>

	<li>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce
	our Terms of Service</li>

	<li>to deliver and target advertising</li>

	<li>to notify users of in-game updates</li>

	<li>to provide in-game leader boards and promote in-game player
	achievements</li>

	<li>to solicit input and feedback to improve Playdemic products and
	services and customize your user experience</li>

	<li>to inform users about new products or promotional offers</li>

	<li>to engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting
	you at the email address We have on file if you are a potential
	winner in a sweepstakes<br>
	 &nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<p>One important use of your information is communication. If you
	have provided your e-mail address to Playdemic, We'll use it to
	respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you
	informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends,
	notifications about in-game status such as "crops ready" as well as
	notifications of gift and neighbor requests. Some messages, such as
	invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name
	and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and
	promotional SMS messages ("Promotional Communications") directly or
	in partnership with parties other than Playdemic. Each Promotional
	Communication will generally offer recipients choices about
	receiving additional messages.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>5. Sharing of Your Information</strong></p>

	<p>We will share your information (in some cases personal
	information) with third parties, that is parties other than
	Playdemic, in the following circumstances:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong></p>

	<p>We will provide your information to third party companies to
	perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data
	analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and
	to assist Us in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third
	party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the
	information disclosed to them and to not use your information for
	any purpose other than to provide services on Playdemic's
	behalf.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Friends and Other Playdemic Players</strong></p>

	<p>The Service supports and may encourage interaction among
	players. In most Playdemic games your SNS friends will see your
	name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. In many
	Playdemic games friends and other players will be able to see your
	game profile, which may include your name or a "game name" and your
	profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS User ID
	number or Playdemic ID. Access to a Playdemic ID or your SNS User
	ID may allow others to view the public information associated with
	your related SNS or Playdemic account. Other players may also be
	able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the
	related SNS' communication channels.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Advertising of Third Party Products and
	Services</strong></p>

	<p>We do not actively share personal information with third party
	advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give Us
	your consent.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you
	and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to
	you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical
	information (including IP Addresses and mobile device IDs) to
	develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the
	websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect
	these types of information within the Service and they may share it
	with Us. Advertisers may collect this information through the use
	of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The
	information collected may be used to offer you targeted
	ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user
	experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and
	services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral
	advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze
	traffic and other end user activity to improve your
	experience).</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated
	information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this
	Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Offer Walls</strong></p>

	<p>Playdemic games or their purchase pages may display an "offer
	wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall
	allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users
	in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing
	a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with
	one of those advertisers. These are not offers made by Playdemic.
	These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical
	information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic
	information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you
	will no longer be on a site hosted by Playdemic or a partnering
	SNS. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a
	unique identifier, in some cases your user ID number, will be
	shared with the offer wall provider.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</strong></p>

	<p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online
	communications (including without limitation chat text, voice
	communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be
	accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may
	be disclosed: (i) when We have a good faith belief that We are
	required to disclose the information in response to legal process
	(for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to
	satisfy any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where We believe
	that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime,

	<p>In the event that Playdemic undergoes a business transition,
	such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or
	a portion of its assets, We may transfer all of your information,

	<p><strong>8. Your Sharing and Messaging Options</strong></p>

	<p><strong><br>
	</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Information We Receive from Third Party SNS Where You
	play a Playdemic Game</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>If you play our games at a third-party SNS, Playdemic will be
	able to access and store profile and other information about you as
	described above. The categories of information you share with Us
	will depend, in part, on the permissions you grant Us and the
	privacy settings you have established at the SNS where you access
	the application. Playdemic does not offer an "opt out" option for
	specific fields that are shared by the SNS where you access and
	play the game(s).</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Opting out of Promotional Communications</strong></p>

	<p>You can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional
	e-mails from Playdemic by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any
	such e-mail. Please note that once We receive your request, it may
	take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become
	effective. Your unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be
	processed promptly, and in no event longer than 10 business
	days.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Opting Out of Other Communications</strong></p>

	<p>You can opt out of receiving SMS messages by texting STOP to the
	number We send from for that particular SMS program. In some cases
	a preference management page will also be available under the
	"Help" menu of the game that is offering the SMS program. When We
	receive an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, We may send a
	message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose
	to receive push notifications. You can turn off push notifications
	by visiting the "options" or "settings" page within the relevant
	game. You may also receive local notifications. You can turn off
	local notifications by visiting the "options" or "settings" page
	within the relevant game.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Note that if you opt-out of our Promotional Communications or
	other forms of communication, We may still e-mail or communicate
	with you from time to time if We need to provide you with
	information or if We need to request information from you with
	respect to a transaction initiated by you or for other legitimate
	non-marketing reasons.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>9. International Operations</strong></p>

	<p>As part of our international operations, We may transfer data to
	our Affiliates from time to time for our legitimate business
	purposes.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Playdemic will store information about site visitors and players
	on servers located in different countries from time to time.
	Personal data collected within any country may be transferred to,
	and stored at, a destination in any other country in the world. The
	data We hold may also be processed by employees operating in any
	country by Us or one of our Affiliates or for one of our vendors.
	Such employees may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the
	processing of transactions and your payment details and (ii) the
	provision of support services. By submitting your personal data or
	playing Playdemic games, you agree to this transfer, storing or
	processing.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Playdemic will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is
	treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>10. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and
	Advertisers</strong></p>

	<p>Our websites and games may contain advertisements from companies
	other than Playdemic that may link to their own websites. We are
	not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
	websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites
	use your information, you should review their policies and contact
	them directly.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>11. Security of Your Information</strong></p>

	<p>Playdemic implements reasonable security measures to protect the
	security of your information both online and offline, and We are
	committed to the protection of customer information.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>For user accounts registered directly with Playdemic profile
	information is protected by the password each member uses to access
	their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain
	the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of
	any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to
	your Playdemic account, the website allows you to request that
	instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your
	password. When you sign into your account or enter payment
	information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual
	currency), We encrypt the transmission of that information using
	secure socket layer technology ("SSL").</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>While We take reasonable precautions against possible security
	breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no
	website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and We
	cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or
	other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep
	your personal information safe (including your account password),
	and to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is
	hacked, this may lead to unauthorised play of your Playdemic games,
	so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have
	questions about the security of our websites, please contact Us at
	<a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy@playdemic.com</a>.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet
	is not completely secure. Although We strive to protect your
	personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of your data while
	it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your
	own risk. Once We have received your information, We have
	procedures and security features in place to try to prevent
	unauthorized access.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>12. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

	<p>If We decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, We
	will notify you and other users by placing a notice on
	Playdemic.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address We
	have on file for you. We may supplement this process by placing
	notices in our games and on other Playdemic websites. You should
	periodically check www.playdemic.com and this privacy page for
	updates.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>13. Sharing of information with Third
	Parties</strong></p>

	<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for
	their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to
	such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information
	from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other
	promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask Us to share your
	personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes,
	We will only share information in connection with that specific
	promotion, as We do not share information with any third party
	(other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent
	disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing
	by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide
	personal information on one of our sites.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Right to Access</strong></p>

	<p>Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal
	information held about themselves. Your right of access can be
	exercised in accordance with applicable law. Please submit any
	requests for access to your personal data in writing to <a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy@playdemic.com</a>.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>14. Contact Us</strong></p>

	<p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding our
	Privacy Policy and/or practices, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy@playdemic.com</a>. All
	other inquiries should be directed to <a href="http://support.playdemic.com/support/" target="_blank">Playdemic's Support Page</a>.</p>
