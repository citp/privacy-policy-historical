###  Privacy Policy - PlayerAuctions

This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of the PlayerAuctions.com ("PlayerAuctions") web site which is identified by the uniform resource locator PlayerAuctions.com (the "Site"). This policy tells you about how we use and protect your personal information. This policy covers only information that is collected through the Site. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

Scope

This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on the Site. There are several places throughout the Site that may link you to other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. When you click through to these websites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. PlayerAuctions recommends that you examine the privacy statements for all third party websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your personal information. The policy that applies on any of our domains or sub-domains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website. 

Subject to the requirements of applicable laws, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the global PlayerAuctions trading community. By using our Sites, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, and you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information ("Personal Information") as described in this Privacy Policy.

You can browse PlayerAuctions.com without telling us who you are. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers. We may collect other information that is provided to us by your web browser. This may include the browser you used to come to our website, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website that you just visited before visiting our website, which pages on our website you visit, any search terms you entered, which URL you go to next, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.

Our Disclosure of Your Information

We may disclose personal information to comply with legal requests, subpoenas, court orders (or substantially similar legal procedures), enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or if we believe it is necessary to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.

Using Information from PlayerAuctions

PlayerAuctions may require you at some point to reveal personal information (such as the name of your in-game character) to other users in order to complete transactions. We require that you respect the privacy of other users. You must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them. You agree to use user information only for: 

  * PlayerAuctions transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages; or 
  * Using services offered through PlayerAuctions.

Cookies

"Cookies" are small files placed on the hard drive of your computer. PlayerAuctions uses cookies to provide services to you. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive once you end your session (log out or close your browser). We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

PlayerAuctions uses cookies on its Web site to: 

  * Allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session; 
  * Provide information that is targeted to your interests;
  * Promote and enforce trust and safety; 
  * Offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies;
  * Measure promotional effectiveness; and 
  * Analyze our web page flow. 

Web Beacons

We may also use web beacon technologies to better tailor the site to provide better customer service. A web beacon is a single pixel image file that allows a website to count users who have visited that page or access certain cookies. These web beacons may be placed on specific pages across this website. When a visitor accesses these pages, a notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors. These web beacons work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want to associate your anonymous cookie information with your visits to these pages, depending on the browser used, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. 

No spam, spyware or spoofing

We and our users do not tolerate spam. You are not licensed to add other PlayerAuctions users, even a user who has purchased from or sold to you, to your mail list (email or physical mail), or other contact without their express consent. To report PlayerAuctions related spam or spoof emails to PlayerAuctions, please forward the email to abuse@playerauctions.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We may filter and automatically scan messages before they are sent for viruses and other illegal or prohibited content. PlayerAuctions may, but is not obligated, to send you strictly service-related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications since they are not promotional in nature and are necessary to maintain quality of service. If you do not wish to receive them, you may have the option to deactivate your account.

Account Protection

Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your PlayerAuctions password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken and financial commitments made in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify PlayerAuctions and change your password. 

Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information

You can see, review and change most of your personal information, including opt-in and opt-out communications preferences, by logging in to PlayerAuctions and clicking on "My Account". Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with state and federal laws, deter fraud, collect any outstanding debts, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce our User Agreement or policies, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. 

Security

Your information is stored on our servers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use multiple tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

Children's privacy

All registered users on PlayerAuctions must be 18 years or older. However in the event that you are under the age of 18 and access areas of our website that do not require an account, please make sure that you provide your Personal Information only after obtaining your parental consent. 

Applicable laws

PlayerAuctions will protect your Personal Information in accordance with the laws of the United States and the state of Delaware. 

General

PlayerAuctions reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes will be posted on this site, so please check back periodically.
