This is the website of the American Planning Association, a nonprofit public interest and research organization of more than 32,000 members dedicated to advancing the art and science of planning to meet the needs of people and society.

Here is what visitors to our website can expect in terms of privacy.

**Domain names**  
Our web server will automatically recognize a visitor's domain name, but not the visitor's e-mail address.

**E-mail addresses**  
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who subscribe to our listserves, those who communicate with us via e-mail, and those who register for our online products and services. APA will not sell or share e-mail addresses with any groups other than its own affiliated chapters and divisions.  


**Other collected information**  
We collect aggregate information on what pages our visitors access or visit. We also collect information volunteered by visitors, such as information provided in onsite conference registrations, job service postings, book service purchases, and other online transactions.

Information we collect may be used to notify visitors about updates to our website and may be used by us to contact visitors for marketing purposes.

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to record session information and to allow APA members who have logged in to access restricted resources. Cookies are also used to provide access to information that requires online registration, such as the _Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook_.

**Provision of information**  
Upon request, we provide site visitors with access to all information that we maintain about them.

**Security**  
When we transfer and receive certain types of data, such as financial information, we will redirect visitors to a secure server and give notification through a pop-up screen on our site.
