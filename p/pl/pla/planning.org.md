# Privacy Statement

The American Planning Association respects the privacy of those who use our products and services. The following policies guide our use of information collected from members, subscribers, customers, and website visitors. We will post notification of material changes to this privacy statement on our website and will update this page with such changes.

## Domain Names

Our web server automatically recognizes a visitor's domain name, but not the visitor's e-mail address.

## E-mail Addresses

We collect the e-mail addresses of members, subscribers, and customers, as well as of those who use our listservs, those who communicate with us via e-mail, and those who register for our website. APA does not sell e-mail addresses to anyone. APA shares e-mail addresses only with our own affiliated chapters and divisions and the Planning Foundation of APA. We share with our own affiliated chapters and divisions only the e-mail addresses of their respective members. APA uses vendors to distribute APA e-mail messages. These vendors are contractually prohibited from using those e-mail addresses for any purpose other than APA e-mail messages.

Membership in APA and many APA subscriptions include electronic benefits, such as e-newsletters. We assume that anyone who joins APA or one of our chapters and divisions or who subscribes to a publication or service wants to receive the electronic benefits of the membership or subscription. Those who do not wish to receive their electronic benefits can unsubscribe via a link in the e-mail that delivers the electronic benefit.

We also use your e-mail address to communicate with you about your membership, subscriptions, purchases, and event registration, as well as to inform you about APA resources you might be interested in, including the Planning Foundation of APA. You can set preferences in My APA for communications other than member and subscriber benefits.

## Other Collected Information

Information you provide in My APA is used for internal planning and evaluating. We do not share your individual information with any groups other than our own chapters and divisions. We do not share salary information with any group, including our chapters and divisions. We do compile information from My APA to establish statistics about APA membership as a whole and may release that information to external parties.

APA members can access an online member directory that may include street addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and fax numbers. Members are instructed that they may not use the information in the member directory for solicitations, commercial activities, fax or e-mail broadcasts, telemarketing, or surveys. In My APA, members may elect to remove their own names and contact information from the member directory.

We collect aggregate information on which pages visitors access. We also collect information volunteered by visitors, such as information provided in conference registration, job and resume postings, and book purchases.

## Cookies

We use cookies to record session information and to allow APA members and subscribers who have logged in to access members-only or subscriber-only resources.

## Provision of Information

Upon request, we provide visitors access to all information we maintain about them and allow visitors to correct any inaccuracies in such information.

## Security

When we transfer and receive certain types of information, such as financial data, we will send that information through a secure connection.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about our privacy statement, please e-mail [websitefeedback@planning.org](mailto:websitefeedback@planning.org).
