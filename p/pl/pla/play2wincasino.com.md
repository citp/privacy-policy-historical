**YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

When you register on our website, play any of our games, make a player or customer query, you will be asked for some personal information.

Play2win also collects other type of data like information on the amount of visitors, the place where they are located, how long they surf the site, which banners or links they have followed to reach the site, the kind of games they like playing, etc. This type of data will remain anonymous and will not be associated with any individual person. However, we might gather personal data if you have reached our site through an affiliate so as to be able to produce some kind of compensation for such affiliate.

If we happen to disclose such data with people who do not work for our company, it will be subject to an express agreement on their behalf not to disclose any of your data and treat it as confidential. They will also have to agree to use your information for the only purpose of carrying out their obligations and duties to our company.

We are likely to attach to any of these messages a traceable URL or any other type of program so as to check the effectiveness of the messages. These mechanisms help us confirm if you have opened the emails we sent you or if you have responded to our notification.

It’s advisable that parents should check the sites children visit and spend time online with them so as to make sure they do not engage in any illegal activity. Please, contact our Customer Support Staff 24/7 should you have any doubts with regards to any of our security policies. Our staff will gladly assist you any time you might need it.
