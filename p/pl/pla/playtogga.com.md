Togga, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Togga,” “our,” “us,” or "we") respects your privacy. In that regard, we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you use the website vip.playtogga.com (the “Website”), why we collect it, and how it is used. By accessing the Website, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. 

What information does Togga collect? 

Personal Information. If you sign up to play in a fantasy football league on the Website or fill out any other forms located on the Website, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information (including your first and last name, email address, user name and password) that, among other things, will enable you to use certain features and will allow us to efficiently respond to your request. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Website. As used in this document, "Personal Information," means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, employment information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. 

Technical Information. We may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, peripherals and your interactions with the Website (“Technical Information”). Technical Information is gathered periodically to provide software updates, product support, product enhancements and other services to you (if any) related to the Website. We may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or mobile device, which could include your IP address, cookie information, browser information and the page you request. This information is not deemed by Togga to constitute Personal Information and while Togga will not use it in a way that associates such information with you, we may aggregate and use such information. Togga owns this information and may use it in any manner it deems appropriate. 

Location Based Information. You also acknowledge and agree that we may collect information about your physical location and the location of your device through the Website (“Location-Based Information”). 

Do Not Track. We may collect information from your web browser about your activities over time and across third-party websites, applications or other online services (including through embedded features such as buttons or widgets). Your web browser may allow you to opt-out of our collection of this information by selecting a “do not track” (or similar) setting. However, we do not currently have processes to address those settings or other “do not track” requests, and consequently, cannot guarantee that it will honor such requests. If you do not want us to collect this information, do not use the Website. 

How does Togga use this Information? 

Except as otherwise set forth herein, Personal Information, Technical Information and Location-Based Information (collectively, “Information”) that you provide or that we collect will be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with Togga. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information through the Website, and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services through newsletters and emails from Togga. YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND OTHER INFORMATION MAY BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF INITIATING COMMERCIAL MESSAGES. We will allow you to opt out of receiving commercial messages, but in order to stop receiving any messages from us whatsoever (including administrative messages regarding the Service), you will need to terminate your account. 

You own all right, title, and interest in and to any data (excluding Technical Information) that we collect from you via your use of and interaction with the Website (“Data”). You also grant Togga a perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty free license to use such Data in order to collect, develop, create, extract or otherwise generate statistics and other information and to otherwise compile, synthesize and analyze such Data (“Blind Data”). To the extent that Togga collects or generates Blind Data, such Blind Data will be owned solely by Togga and may be used for any lawful business purpose without a duty of accounting to you, provided that such data is not personally identifiable and does not identify the source of such data.
