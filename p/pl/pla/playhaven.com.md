##  Privacy Policy 

**Effective Date: October 16, 2014**  
This privacy policy (“Policy“) explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by PlayHaven, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“PlayHaven“, “we” or “us“), when you access the PlayHaven web site at www.PlayHaven.com (the “Site“) or interact with the PlayHaven analytics and marketing platform (the “PlayHaven Platform“). The PlayHaven Platform provides tools to application providers (“Publishers”) to enable them to better understand and communicate with the users of their mobile applications (“Applications”) and to serve advertisements (“Ads“) through their Applications from advertisers that are part of the PlayHaven ad network or other third-party ad networks (“Advertisers“). The Site, PlayHaven Platform, and the serving of Ads are collectively referred to as the “Services.” If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, you must terminate your use of the Services.

_We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by posting the revised policy to the Site. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. Changes will become effective as of the Effective Date listed at the top of this Policy. We_ _encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used._ _Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this Policy will indicate your acceptance of those changes._

This Policy is subject to the provisions of PlayHaven’s Terms of Service, which are fully incorporated herein by reference. To review the Terms of Service, please [click here](http://www.playhaven.com/terms "Terms of Service").

**What Is Personal Information?  
**As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**What Information Do We Collect?  
**We may collect information in a number of ways when you use the Services:

**Active Collection.  
**We collect certain information when you voluntarily provide it, such as if you send us an email, fill out a form, post comments or other content, or otherwise provide or request information. This may include when you voluntarily provide information to PlayHaven in response to an in-app communication from a Publisher using the PlayHaven Platform. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, user name, email, address, telephone number, and other contact and demographic information you choose to provide. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Services. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact, or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Services.

Our Site offers social media features, including a connection to Facebook’s invites, notifications, feeds, like button, and other user-to-user interaction data, that may collect your IP address, page view information from your use on the Site, and may set cookies to enable the features to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Passive Collection.  
**When you use the Services, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, your activity on the Site, and custom event and monetization data. When you view an Ad while accessing or using an Application, we may automatically collect your device type and IP address as well as a device ID for your mobile device. We also may collect information about your use and activity on the Application and the PlayHaven Platform. Your IP address may be used to determine the location of your use. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above.

Information provided by device ID’s may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, to make recommendations to you, to better understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the effectiveness of communications, to provide dashboard metrics and insights, and to benchmark information for select plans.

For some features of the Services, you may be able to submit information about other people. For instance, if you wish to send a coupon or advertisement to a friend you may submit some of your friend’s personal information. PlayHaven will use any such information that we collect from you about another person to carry out your request. We may also share such information with Advertisers for them to carry out your request.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies** **.
