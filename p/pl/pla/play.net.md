Cookies and first party tracking | We use cookies and clear GIFs. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to a computer’s hard drive while a web site is viewed.

Among other things, cookies allow us to provide a more personal and interactive experience and to improve our marketing efforts. Persistent cookies may be removed by following instructions provided by your browser. If you choose to disable cookies some areas or features of our websites may not work properly. | We have a legitimate interest in making our website operate efficiently.   
  
In addition to the information that we collect from you directly, we may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, business partners, our affiliates, or publicly available sources. For example, if you submit a job application, or become an employee or contractor, we may conduct a background check.

## **_Use And Processing Of Information_**

In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we use information in the following ways:

  * To send marketing and promotional materials, including information relating to our products, services, sales, or promotions.
  * For internal administrative purposes, as well as to manage our relationships.



Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any issues with your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.

## **_Sharing Of Information_**

In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we disclose information in the following situations:

  1. **Affiliates and Acquisitions**. We may share information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control). If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, we will also share information with that company. 
  2. **Other Disclosures with Your Consent**. We may ask if you would like us to share your information with other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this policy.
  3. **Other Disclosures without Your Consent**. We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also share your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the provision of services by a third party intermediary.
  4. **Public**. Some of our websites may provide the opportunity to post in a public forum. If you decide to submit information on these forums, that information may be publically available. 
  5. **Partner Promotion**. We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third party partners.

You can make the following choices regarding your personal information:

  1. **Promotional Emails**. A valid email address is required for an account, but you may choose to opt-in to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties.

In addition, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain cyber security, and/or enforce any of our agreements. 
  4. **Revocation Of Consent**. If you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information then we may no longer be able to provide you services. In some cases, we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. You may revoke consent to processing (where such processing is based upon consent) by contacting us using the contact information below.
  5. **Access To Your Personal Information**. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you with reasonable access to the personal information that have about you. You may request access to your personal information by contacting us at the contact information below.

## **_How We Protect Personal Information_**

Nonetheless, where possible we take steps to treat personal information using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States. If you would like more information concerning our attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information below.
  * **Third Party Applications/Websites**. We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own.
