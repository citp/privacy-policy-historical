Simutronics Corporation has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: _http://www.play.net_. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you. 

We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.  Cookies are also used to establish a "session" as you move through our site which is an automatic feature of Microsoft's IIS 5.0 using ASP.  Without cookies enabled, our web site will not work for you. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services (once any trial period has expired). Unique identifiers are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for other purposes. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

This site contains links to other sites. www.play.net is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

This site uses co-branded pages, but none of the information entered into these pages are shared with partners. For example, you may enter information on our account sign-up form, which has an _Excite_ logo on it, however no account information is shared with _Excite_ , or with any of our other co-branding partners.

Our online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. We help shape our development decisions based on your survey information.

We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

**Public Forums  
**This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security  
**This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We used secure servers for account registration and login, and will sometimes use security questions to verify the controller of the account.

**Children's Guidelines  
**This site gives children the ability to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent. However Simutronics Corporation does employ staff to monitor the interactive parts of our site to help ensure as kid-friendly atmosphere as is possible in a highly interactive environment.
