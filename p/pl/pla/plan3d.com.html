        (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you 
        are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet 
        service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink) and  information about your hardware settings 
        (e.g., the type of 3D video card, CPU speed, amount of memory and so on) to provide you with technical support and to allow plan3D to operate correctly on your computer.</p>
      <p>REGISTRATION: In  order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form  and create a user name and password.&nbsp;  During registration you are also required to give contact information  (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about  the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information may be used to send you information about your membership such as newsletters, upgrade information, renewal notices, etc. </p>
      <p>ORDERS: If  you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally  identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact  information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial  information (such as credit card number, expiration date).&nbsp;We use this information for  billing purposes and to fill your orders.&nbsp;  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to  contact you. </p>
      <p><strong><a name="owner" id="owner"></a>Owner of Information Collected </strong><br>
      Plan3D, Inc. is the sole owner of  the information collected on the plan3D website. Plan3D collects personally  identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web  site.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="2"></a>How We Use the Information</strong><br>
        We may use  information you provide about yourself to fulfill your 
        requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your 
        inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs 
        or services that we believe may be of interest to you - although we will 
        never give your information to other people or companies outside plan3D 
        without your explicit permission.</p>
      <p>We may use this information to communicate with you, when we make changes 
        to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online 
        newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
      <p>We sometimes use the personally identifiable information that we 
        collect about your computer hardware to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us 
        to personalize your Internet experience and to provide technical support. We also may use this information 
        in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, 
        programs, or services from time to time.</p>
      <p>Employees and contractors of Plan3D who have access to personally identifiable 
        information are required to protect this information in a manner that 
        is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the 
        information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they 
        are performing for Plan3D.</p>
      <p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized 
        disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable 
        information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is 
        inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, 
        for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking 
        the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves 
        for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p>
      <p>Finally, Plan3D sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable 
        information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above 
        without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated 
        uses.</p>
      <p>We post customer testimonials  on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as  the customer's name.&nbsp; We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting  the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally  identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure  is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding,  court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="orders" id="orders"></a>Your Personal Information Shared with Order-Processing Companies:&nbsp; </strong>We use other third  parties  to provide online order processing <em></em> on our site.&nbsp;  When you sign up for plan3D, we will share your name, address and credit card information with Verisign corporation and E-Merchants Bank <em></em> as necessary for them to process the credit card order so we can  provide the plan3D service to you. </p>
      <p>These third parties are  prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other  purpose than to confirm that you are authorized to use the credit card, process the financial transaction for plan3D. </p>
      <p><strong><a name="3"></a>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites 
        and Sponsors</strong><br>
        Plan3D sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are 
        sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue 
        of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable 
        information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, 
        sweepstakes, or promotion. Plan3D has no control over the third-party 
        sponsors' use of this information. Plan3D will notify you at the time 
        of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors 
        will obtain such information.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="4"></a>Cookies</strong><br>
        To enhance your experience at Plan3D, many of our web pages use "cookies." 
        Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your 
        preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address 
        or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide 
        this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. 
        However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable 
        information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the 
        cookie.</p>
      <p>We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and 
        offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize 
        your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you 
        return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas. We 
        also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="5"></a>Security</strong> <strong>Practices</strong> <br>
        The security of your personal information is important  to us.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive  information (such as credit card number) on our  registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket  layer technology (SSL).</p>
      <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to  protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and  once we receive it.&nbsp; No method of  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%  secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we  strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal  information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
      If you  have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at  support@plan3D.com

      <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to 
        help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
