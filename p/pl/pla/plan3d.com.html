    <h3>How We Safeguard Your Privacy</h3>
    <p align="justify" class="bodyTextNoIndent"><br>
      Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, 
          we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and 
          the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and 
used. <br>
                  <br>
        </p>

        <h6><br>
          Privacy Policy - Plain English</h6>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText"><br>
        WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION CAREFULLY<br>
        The first thing we do to safeguard your information is to carefully protect our systems. We use every  means at our disposal to safeguard our servers from hackers and outsiders. This includes but is not limited to 128 bit SSL encryption of all data transmitted, hourly anti-hacker software scans, hourly anti-spam, anti-malware scans of our servers, and state-of-the-art  hardware and  software firewalls to deny hackers access to our servers and database every second. We are constantly diligent in this regard.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">WE DON'T SHARE  INFORMATION UNLESS REQUIRED<br>
        We never share your personal information with anyone unless they are  part of the order taking or accounting process and have a need to know as part of our business arrangements with them (such as Visa, PayPal, etc.). None of these entities are ever given permission to contact you or share this information.<br>
      </p>
  <p align="justify" class="bodyText">WE DON'T STORE YOUR INFORMATION ON OUR SERVERS <br>
    We do not store your  payment data on our servers, except for a short period during the transaction process, such as credit card  or other payment data, to more securely protect you from hackers. All payment information is erased from our system after ordering is complete. We believe this  helps thwart  a determined genius hacker from accessing your personal payment information. They will find it more difficult to  find credit card or other payment information if they do manage to get access to our servers  - although the might be able to access your name, address, plan3D user name, plan3D password, and email information if they break into our database. For that reason we recommend you do not use the same password  you use with banks or other entities where security is very important. As of this date we have never been hacked into - but if Sony and other mega-billion dollar companies can be hacked into as reported in national news services recently, we suppose any web site could be hacked in if the attacker were smart or persistent enough.<br>

      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">REGISTRATION: In  order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form  and create a user name and password.&nbsp;  During registration you are also required to give contact information  (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about  the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information may be used to send you information about your membership such as newsletters, upgrade information, renewal notices, etc. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">ORDERS: If  you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally  identifiable information from you on our order form.

        </p>
      <h6><a name="2" id="2"></a>How We Use This Information</h6>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText"><br>
        We may use  information you provide about yourself to fulfill your 
        requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your 
        inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs 
        or services that we believe may be of interest to you - although we will 
        never give your information to other people or companies outside plan3D 
        without your explicit permission.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">We may use this information to communicate with you, when we make changes 
        to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online 
        newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">We sometimes use the personally identifiable information that we 
        collect about your computer hardware to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us 
        to personalize your Internet experience and to provide technical support. We also may use this information 
        in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, 
        programs, or services from time to time.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">Employees and contractors of Plan3D who have access to personally identifiable 
        information are required to protect this information in a manner that 
        is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the 
        information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they 
        are performing for Plan3D.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized 
        disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable 
        information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is 
        inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, 
        for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking 
        the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves 
        for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">Finally, Plan3D sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable 
        information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above 
        without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated 
        uses.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">We post customer testimonials  on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as  the customer's name.&nbsp; We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting  the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">We reserve the right to disclose your personally  identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure  is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding,  court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
      <h6><a name="orders" id="orders"></a>Information Shared During Order Processing</h6>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText"><br>
      We use other third  parties  to provide online order processing  on our site.&nbsp;  When you sign up for plan3D, we will share your name, address and credit card information with Verisign corporation, PayPal, and E-Merchants Bank  as necessary for them to process the credit card order so we can  provide the plan3D service to you. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">These third parties are  prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other  purpose than to confirm that you are authorized to use the credit card, process the financial transaction for plan3D. </p>
      <h6><a name="3" id="3"></a>Collection of Information by Third Party Sites</h6>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText"><br>
        Plan3D sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are 
        sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue 
        of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable 
        information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, 
        sweepstakes, or promotion. Plan3D has no control over the third-party 
        sponsors' use of this information. Plan3D will notify you at the time

        also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
