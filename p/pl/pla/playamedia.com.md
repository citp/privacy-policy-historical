### 3\. Processing Purposes & Legal Bases

We process your data exclusively for the following defined purposes:

**
  * To allow you and other users to use the Service and to ensure its functionality
  * To continuously improve the service offer and to correct errors

  * To assert legal claims and to defend against legal disputes
  * To ensure IT security and operation of our systems
**


In doing so, we rely on various legal bases in accordance with the so-called General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union legal framework for the standardisation of data protection law (“GDPR” for short). We refer in detail to the following legal bases:

**Your consent**

When you visit the website, you agree to our cookie guidelines and to the processing of your IP address in a cookie bar. If you have given your consent to the processing of personal data for specific purposes, this consent ensures the legality of such processing.

Accordingly, if we process your data, it is because you expressly allowed us to do so. Your consent is therefore the most important legal basis for the processing of your personal data by us.

**Safeguarding legitimate interests**

That is why we process your data, in principle, because you have allowed us to do so. However, there are some cases in which we would be entitled to process your data without your consent because it is necessary to protect our legitimate interests (or the interests of third parties). In this respect, the purposes for which we process your data also represent legitimate interests. We pursue legitimate interests, for example, if we check images or texts for content relevant under criminal law or if we take measures to secure virtual domiciliary rights. In these cases, we will not ask you in advance whether you agree to this processing, as processing is otherwise permitted.

**Legal requirements or public interest**

In addition, we are legally obliged to provide certain information to criminal prosecution in individual cases upon request.
