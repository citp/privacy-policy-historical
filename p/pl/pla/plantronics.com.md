******What Information Does Plantronics Collect?** **

Plantronics will collect personal information from our users for different purposes. The following lists the ways in which we collect personal information from our users and the type of information collected:

__Information you provide voluntarily__

Through the completion of the questionnaire by a user we typically collect the following information: (i) full name; (ii) address; (iii) e-mail address; (iv) credit card information; (v) password; and (vi) nickname. The provision of this personal information is mandatory and if you choose not to submit the requested information we will not be able to provide you with the products or services offered on the Website.

The provision of this information is optional. SuccessFactors is not allowed to use the information collected for any purpose other than the original purpose.

_Please note that if you ask us to delete your personal information we will endeavor to comply with your request in compliance with applicable law, but may need to retain and use some information where necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements._

**Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA visitors only)**

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

We may collect information from you in the following ways:  1) with your consent; 2) in order to perform our contractual obligations with you; 3) where the processing of the information is within our legitimate business interests and such business interest is not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or 4) in order to perform our legal obligations or to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another.

If legally permissible, we will inform you that we are collecting your personal information and whether the collection of the information is mandatory or not, including the possible consequences if you do not provide the information requested (e.g., our inability to perform certain requests).

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at [privacy@plantronics.com](mailto:privacy@plantronics.com)

To request removal of your personal information from these areas, contact us at [privacy@plantronics.com](mailto:mailto:privacy@plantronics.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Social Media Features and Widgets**

Our Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the "Share This" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website.

**What About Security of Data Transmission?**

We use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are intended to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Plantronics cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our products or services.

**International Data Transfers**

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.

Specifically, our Website servers are located in the U.S. and Australia, Singapore and Ireland, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken legal safeguards, including implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with the European Union data protection law.

Further details about the Standard Contractual Clauses we have implemented or the safeguards we have adopted with our third party service providers and partners and further details will be provided upon request.

You can exercise these rights by contacting us at [Privacy@Plantronics.com](mailto:Privacy@Plantronics.com)

In the circumstances where you have consented to the collection and processing of your personal information, you can **withdraw your consent** at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal.  Additionally, if the information was collected for another reason (e.g., to perform a contractual obligation, for legitimate business interests that are not outweighed by your data protection interests or for another legally permissible purpose), the withdrawal of your consent will be effective when such purpose no longer exists.

You have the **right to file a complaint with a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
