**What Information Does Plantronics Collect?  
**Plantronics will collect personal information from our users for different purposes. Information gathered online can be identified as either anonymous or identifiable. Anonymous information is information that cannot be traced back to the individual. Identifiable information is information that is specific to the individual so that we can deliver the right products and services to the individual. The following lists the many ways in which we collect personal information from our users and the type of information collected:

TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS: To purchase lightweight communications headset products and to obtain other services offered on www.plantronics.com, a user has to create his/her profile by completing a questionnaire online. Through the completion of the questionnaire by a user we collect the following information: (i) full name; (ii) address; (iii) e-mail address; (iv) credit card information; (v) password; and (vi) nickname. The provision of this personal information is mandatory and if you choose not to submit the requested information we will not be able to provide you with the services offered on www.plantronics.com.

TO REGISTER PRODUCTS: To register your purchased product online, we request the following information: (i) full name; (ii) email address; and (iii) purchase date. The provision of this information is mandatory in order to register your purchase online. The provision of the remaining information requested on the product registration form is optional.

TO JOIN THE PLANTRONICS TEAM: To join the Plantronics team, a user may consider submitting his/her resume online. By virtue of our online resume form we collect the following personal information: (i) full name; (ii) home phone; (iii) e-mail; (iv) educational background; and (v) the text of the resume. The provision of this information is mandatory. In addition to mandatory information, we request information such as address, current employment, ability to speak other languages and a brief description of your career objectives. The provision of this information is optional.

TO BECOME A PLANTRONICS DEALER: To become a Plantronics dealer, a user must complete an online application. By virtue of our online application we collect personal information such as the user's full name and e-mail address. The provision of this information is mandatory for users who want to become dealers. In addition to this mandatory information, we request information such as current employment, phone and fax. The provision of this information is optional.

TO PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE SURVEYS: If you desire, you may participate in Plantronics' online surveys. If you choose to participate, we will collect anonymous information about the environment you work in, telephone habits, and demographic information. These surveys are developed in order for us to understand what types of products are most effective for our customers and to find the best ways to advertise to reach new customers. Your participation in our online surveys is entirely voluntary.

**Do I have to Register With www.plantronics.com?  
**All users can access the www.plantronics.com website without being a registered user. However, you will not be able to access certain areas or purchase our products online if you are not a registered online user of www.plantronics.com. 

**How Does Plantronics Use My Information?  
**Personal information collected by us is used primarily for the purpose it is collected: to facilitate the purchases online, to register users' purchases, to process users' resumes or to consider dealer applications. In particular, the users' shipping and billing addresses are used for fulfilling the purchase orders and to bill a user's credit card. The personal information provided in a resume and dealer's application is used to consider the eligibility of the candidates. In addition to the original purpose for which the personal information is collected, we may use the personal information to contact users to confirm information related to his/her order or to advise a user if an item is on back order. Plantronics also may use users' email address and/or phone number as follows provided that the user grants his/her consent to such additional use:

  * in our internal surveys to obtain feedback on our products, our website, or on other aspects of our business that impact you as a Plantronics customer;
  * to notify users of new products or services we think may be of interest to them;
  * to send promotional materials;



Users will receive such promotional materials only if they have indicated that they do not object to receiving such information. If users prefer not to receive e-mails or phone calls unrelated to their Plantronics orders, they simply should not check the boxes on the registration form that request their consent to this additional use of their personal information. 

We may also use personal information collected to contact users in connection with the inappropriate use of the www.plantronics.com website.

We do not sell or rent the personal information collected to third parties. To facilitate the online purchases of our products, we use third party distributors and shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We have advised these companies of this Privacy Statement and have requested that they do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to implement the sales transaction.

**What About Security of Data Transmission?**  
Please note that at plantronics.com there is a form where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction. Any time we ask for a credit card number, we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Plantronics cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

**Can I Correct/Update the Information Collected About Me?**  
You have the right to correct/update the personal information collected about you at www.plantronics.com. You can make changes to your personal profile at any time by going to the "My Profile" page on our website. You will need your Logon ID (user name) and password in order to access your personal information.

**Will You Notify Me in the Event of Changes to this Privacy Statement?** If we decide to change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes on our homepage ([www.plantronics.com](http://www.plantronics.com/index.html)) so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this new manner. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was collected.

**Miscellaneous**

**Contests/Sweepstakes**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via contests. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. If you choose to enter into one of our contests/sweepstakes, please be aware that we may share contestants' anonymous information with our advertisers and affiliated partners.

**How Can I Opt-In?**  
We provide registered users the opportunity to opt-in to receiving updates on the new products offered on plantronics.com and promotional materials from us. The opt-in procedure is fairly easy and may be exercised at the creation of your customer profile by checking the appropriate box.

**How Can I Opt-Out?**  
If you have opted in and later desire to opt-out from further receiving updates on the new products offered on www.plantronics.com and promotional materials from us, you can make this change at any time by going to the "My Profile" page on our website. You will need your Logon ID (user name) and password in order to access your personal information and effect this change.

**Why Do I Need an ID and Password?**  
At our e-commerce site we provide an area for you to store your billing address, and shipping addresses. This is your private information and you should keep it secure. We also require that you enter your Logon ID (nick name) and password for accessing Order Status where you will view the details of products ordered from Plantronics.

**What are Cookies and How Does Plantronics Use Them?**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Plantronics uses cookies to establish a link between your computer and a Plantronics' distributor. This link assures that when you return to plantronics.com, you will see the same distributor's information and be able to check the progress of your order online with that distributor. 

You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.
