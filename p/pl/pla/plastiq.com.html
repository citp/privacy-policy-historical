If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through this Website.

Additionally, if for any reason you find our "opt-out" instructions unclear, and wish to cease receiving any communications from Plastiq, or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as at <a href="mailto:privacy@plastiq.com">privacy@plastiq.com</a>. We retain the right to contact you regarding your use of the Services.</p><p>Plastiq will occasionally conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information provided to us.

We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Platform to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p><h2 id="part5">Does Plastiq ever disclose Personal Data or other information?</h2><p>Plastiq does not sell or rent your Personal Data to marketers or third parties for marketing purposes.</p><p>Like many companies, we sometimes share information with trusted third parties to perform functions related to this Website and our Platform.

These third parties may have limited access to databases of user information solely for the purpose of helping us to improve the Website and/or the Services.</p><h2 id="part6">How does Plastiq secure Personal Data?</h2><p>Credit and debit card data is stored and managed in compliance with strict Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards. Plastiq utilizes tokenization, a payments industry-standard procedure, to limit exposure of sensitive cardholder data. Your credit and/or debit card information is sent directly to our secure, encrypted data vault, which generates a random, cryptographically secure token that is used by our payment application to submit payments on your card. Once information is deposited into the vault, it cannot be directly retrieved by our payment application or any third parties.</p><p>Although no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure and error free, Plastiq takes great care to protect Personal Data collected via this Website from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, in both transit and at rest.

Other security safeguards include, but are not limited to, encrypted vault storage for sensitive data, strict hardware firewalls, and limited physical access to buildings, servers, and files.</p><p>As our data centers are located in Canada, your Personal Data may be available to the Canadian government or its agencies under a lawful order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Data.</p><p>We at Plastiq do our best to secure your data, and we ask that you take reasonable precautions as well. Ensure your personal computing device has up-to-date security and anti-virus software, and please consider carefully what information you choose to send anyone via the Internet and log of your account when you are finished using the Services and do not share your password with anyone.</p><h2 id="part7">How are updates to this Policy handled?</h2><p>This Website and Services may change from time to time, which may necessitate revisions to this Policy.
