**Your Rights in relation to your Personal Information**

You can write to us at any time to obtain a copy of your Personal Information and to have any details thereof amended. 

**Security & Protection of Your Personal Information**

We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard all the Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. 

The Company undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Personal Information, preferences and other information it has collected through this Site and will never knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside the Company other than as described herein. The Company has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the Company network, including the confidentiality of Personal Information collected through this Site. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol.

You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your Company username and any password (if such is provided or enacted) are confidential, and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet as a public transmission network, neither the Company’s network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Personal Information that is transmitted to us by you, the Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Thus, any Personal Information transmitted to us is done so at your own risk. Once we receive Personal Information, the Company undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
