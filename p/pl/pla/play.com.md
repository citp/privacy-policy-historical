#####  Use of data

We may monitor customer traffic patterns, Site usage and related Site information in order to optimise your use of the Site and we may give aggregated statistics to a reputable third-party, but these statistics will include no information personally identifying you.   We may combine your information with information lawfully obtained from other third party sources and use it to optimise your use of the Site and improve our services to you.

We may also use the Information we gather to notify you about important functionality changes and alterations to the Site, or offers of products, services or information that might be of particular interest to you.  

We may share the information we gather with trusted business and technical partners for operational purposes such as handling orders, delivering products and services, processing credit and debit card payments, sending communications, providing customer service functions, for fraud detection services and for data analysis.  Those of our partners who need to access personal information perform their business services, may not use the data for other purposes. 

Where you are involved in a transaction with a Seller/Merchant (third party who sells items through play.com website) your email address, postal address and contact information may be shared with the Seller/Merchant for the purpose of completing the transaction for which it is received. You will also receive emails from the Seller/Merchant confirming the order, including dispatch or eventual refund, and follow-up invitations to leave feedback for the Seller/Merchant.  You agree to receive these emails and accept that this does not breach any privacy requests. During any contact with Sellers/Merchants, we strongly encourage you to ask questions before you disclose personal information which the Seller/Merchant may not have obtained during the process of the order.

All payments are handled by Play.com; you should not buy directly through a Seller/Merchant.  Sellers/Merchants must never ask a buyer for payment card details, bank details or other payment method details.

We may also share data with law enforcement agencies and/or third parties in respect of information requests for criminal investigations and alleged illegal activities.  The personal information we disclose may include your name, billing/delivery address, telephone number, email address, and order history.

We always aim to improve the services we offer. As a result we occasionally canvass our customers using surveys, provided that they have given their prior and express consent.

Should you choose to do so, we will treat the information you provide with the same high standard of care as all other customer information.

#####  Email a friend

We operate an ‘Email a friend’ service. This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for customers to recommend our Site and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process. First, a customer sends us the friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to take advantage of a particular offer, or to visit our website. When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral. We will not use your friend’s details for any other purpose.

When a customer wishes to sponsor a friend and provides us with his/her name and e-mail address, we reasonably assume that such customer has obtained his/her friend's prior consent in order for us to process his/her data. Customers supply such information freely and voluntarily, under their sole responsibility.
