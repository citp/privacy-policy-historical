##### ‘Email a friend’

We may from time to time operate an ‘Email a friend’ service. This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for customers to recommend our Site and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process. First, a customer sends us the friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to take advantage of a particular offer, or to visit our website. When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral. We will not use your friend’s details for any other purpose.

When a customer wishes to sponsor a friend and provides us with his/her name and e-mail address, we reasonably assume that such customer has obtained his/her friend's prior consent in order for us to process his/her data. Customers supply such information freely and voluntarily, under their sole responsibility.

If any of the information you provide on the form you complete when ordering a product from the website or subscribing to the services changes, please e-mail us at [privacy@play.com](mailto:privacy@play.com).

We may occasionally modify this Privacy Policy, such variations becoming effective immediately upon posting to the Site and by continuing to use the website, you will be deemed to accept any such variations.

 **Should you have any queries regarding the above Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at[privacy@play.com](mailto:privacy@play.com)**.
