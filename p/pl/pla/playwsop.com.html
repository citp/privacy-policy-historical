        <p class="c28"><span class="c0">Playtika develops and publishes social games for the web and mobile devices (the “Service”). In this Privacy Policy, “Playtika” refers to Playtika Ltd. and its “Affiliates”, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership. We may also refer to Playtika as "we" or "us". </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c28"><span class="c0">Playtika is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and provide them a better social gaming experience ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy has been created to inform you about how Playtika manages, collects, stores, shares, uses and protects the information you provide in connection with any Playtika game or application whenever you play our games or otherwise access any of our Services, products, content, Playtika.com and/or the other domains provided by Playtika. &nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">This Privacy Policy applies whenever you play our games or otherwise access any of our other products, services, content, Playtika.com and/or the other domains provided by Playtika, together referred to as “Services.” This Privacy Policy describes:</span>
        </p>
        <ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_3-0 start" start="1">
            <li class="c25"><span class="c16">what information we collect, how we collect it</span></li>

        <p class="c24 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c28"><span class="c0">By using the Service, you agree to the collection, disclosure, storage and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want Playtika to collect, store, use or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you should not play Playtika’s games or use our Services. Playtika may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and Playtika encourages you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c13"><span class="c0">We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c13"><span class="c0">To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.</span>

        <p class="c13"><span class="c0">Playtika only collects Personal Information to the extent necessary to fulfil one or more of its functions and activities, and will do so only by fair and reasonable means. Generally we will collect Personal Information directly from the individual to whom the Personal Information relates, but in some circumstances (including as outlined below), it may be necessary for us to collect information from a third party source.</span>

        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">If you play Playtika’s games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, Playtika may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the Playtika game you’re playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third-party application.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">For example, Playtika may collect and store some or all of the following information shared by the provider of the connected third-party application:</span>

        </p>

        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Like many websites, Playtika and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking technologies such as "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of Playtika’s Service, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to use. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Third party advertisers on the Services may also use, place or read cookies or other technologies as described below on your browser, and those practices are subject to their own policies. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies, to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features, portions or functionalities of the Service.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">We and our service providers may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.</span>

        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, including: </span>

Some messages, like invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text messages) ("Promotional Communications") directly or in partnership with other parties, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will offer you choices about receiving additional messages. Receipt of such communications depends on Playtika having certain contact information from you. If you play one of our games designed for children under 13, you will not be able to provide us with certain contact information.

In most Playtika games, if you play through a social network or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. Similarly, in many Playtika games, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, will be able to see descriptions of your game activity (including the identification of any Playtika games you have played), communicate with you within our Services, and view your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo. For example, in Playtika Poker, any other player may see your game profile if you are playing at the same table. In certain cases, your profile photo can reveal your social network ID or Playtika player ID, and access to a social network ID or Playtika player ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related social network profile or Playtika account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related social network’s or Playtika’s communication channels.</span>
