<br>

<br>
Personal information collected on the Sites is stored and processed in the United States and by using any of the Sites, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.<br>
<br>
<u><strong>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</strong></u><br>
<br>
In some cases, we will share information we collect (including personal information or anonymous demographic information) with third party companies who may offer products or services in which we believe you may be interested. We also share this information with third parties with whom we partner to co-promote and administer sweepstakes and contests on our Sites.<br>
<br>
We may also share information we collect with third party service providers to manage certain aspects of the services we provide, such as maintaining our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for products and services you purchase through the Sites.<br>
