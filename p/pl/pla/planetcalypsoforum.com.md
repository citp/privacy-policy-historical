We process your personal data for example in order to:

  * Provide the PlanetCalypsoForum.com website to your browser or device;

  * Send voluntary website and subscription alerts via email.



We mainly processes your personal data based on the legal basis that it is necessary for the performance of our contract.

 _Transfer of personal data_

MindArk, MindArk group companies and MindArk’s partners and suppliers, will in some cases process your personal data outside of the EU/EEA. If your personal data is transferred to a third country, MindArk will always take suitable and appropriate safety measures to protect the personal data being processed.

 _How can you affect our processing of your personal data?_

According to data protection legislation, you are entitled to a variety of rights to affect our processing of your personal data. Read more below.

 _Right to withdraw consent and to object to processing_

You have a right to, entirely or partly, withdraw a given consent for the processing of your personal data. Your withdrawal will have effect from the time of your withdrawal.

You also typically have the right to object to our processing of your personal data. You have always a right to object to marketing from us, such as newsletters.

You have the right to rectification of any inaccurate personal data concerning you and to ask us to have incomplete personal data completed.

 _Right to erasure (“the right to be forgotten”) and restriction of processing_

Under certain circumstances, you have the right to request erasure of your personal data. This is the case for example where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or you withdraw your consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for continuance of the processing.

You also have the right to request that MindArk restrict its processing of your personal data. That is the case for example when the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, or the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and instead requests restriction of its use.

 _Right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority_

You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU/EEA member state of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation. You have such a right without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy. In Sweden, the supervisory authority is The Swedish Data Protection Authority.

You have the right to ask us to transfer the personal data we have about you to another company (data portability).

This right applies if:
