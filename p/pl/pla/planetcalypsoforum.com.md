PlanetCalypsoForum may disclose Member information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with Swedish laws (such as Copyright or Criminal law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. We may make such disclosures, in some cases, without providing Members notice.
