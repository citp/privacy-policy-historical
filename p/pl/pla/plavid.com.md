**A)  What cookies are and how they are used **

To make navigation easier and more intuitive, Web Sites and Platforms of the Company make use of cookie technology. Cookies are information entered by a web server (eg. Website) to the User’s Internet browser that automatically stores them on the device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) and automatically sends them to the web server at each subsequent access to the website. Such information may be related to the User, his/her preferences or device to access the Internet and are mainly used to adjust the operation of the website or Platforms to the expectations of the User, offering a more personalized browsing experience and memorizing the choices previously made.

By _default_ , almost all web browsers are set to automatically accept cookies. Visitors/Users can still change the default configuration, as best illustrated below in this very same Policy.

Some cookies are necessary for the proper provision of the Web sites or Platforms, useful for their personalized fruition; in this case, their inhibition could compromise some functionalities of the website.

**B) Types of Cookies**

• “ **Session cookies** ” **:** these cookies are stored on the User’s computer for purely technical and functional requirements, for the transmission of session identifiers required to enable a safe and efficient navigation of the website; they are deleted when closing the browser. This type of cookie avoids the use of other technologies that could compromise the privacy of the navigation of the users;

• “ **Persistent cookies** ” **:** these cookies are stored on the device of the User until their expiry or cancellation from the User. Through persistent cookies visitors accessing the website are automatically recognized at each visit. They are used to facilitate navigation within the website and its correct use, to facilitate access to services that require authentication (avoiding users to re-enter authentication credentials for each access to services), for statistical purposes, to know which areas of the website have been visited, as well as, in some cases, for the optimal management of pages and advertising spaces or to deliver contents and advertisings in line with the choices made by surfers.

Queste due tipologie di cookie (di sessione e persistenti) possono a loro volta essere:

• “ **first party** ” cookies, when they are managed directly by the owner and/or manager of the website;

• “ **third party** ” cookies, when they are set up and managed by foreign managers to the website visited by the User.

**C)  Main purposes of cookies**

**TECHNICAL COOKIES:** those cookies necessary to allow website navigation and the use of certain products and services. They are used, for example, to recognize the user that has logged into his/her mailbox and to keep the session open, even when he/she visits other pages of the website, or to ensure some security measures of the website and monitor their operation.

**ANALYTICS COOKIES:** those cookies that allow to collect data on the User’s use of the Company website or Platforms – including the elements on which you click while browsing, the time spent on the website or on the Platforms of the Company , the number of visitors – in order to improve the performance and design of the website itself or the Platforms or for statistical purposes. All information gathered by these cookies is anonymous and not linked to the User’s personal data. These cookies may be shared with third parties, legal entities and/or individuals, even outside the Company, providing services for the management of the information system used by Mosaicoon or analysis tools. However, this type of cookie is used only for purposes related to the website or to the platforms of the Company.  


**PREFERENCES COOKIES:** those cookies than enable the website to remember the choices made by the User (such as name, language, country of origin, etc.) and provide customized advanced features.   


**COOKIES OF SOCIAL NETWORK:** these cookies enable the User to share even with other users the contents of the website he/she is visiting or to express his/her opinion about. Those cookies are typically used to activate the “Like” or “Follow” of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, to name a few. These services are mainly provided by outside suppliers. If you have an account or if you use the services of such persons on other websites, these websites may be able to know that the User has visited the website or the Platforms of Mosaicoon. The use of data collected from these external operators through cookies is subject to their respective privacy policies, which, therefore, we recommend you to consult in order to know the purposes and methods of processing of personal data carried out by them.  


**ADVERTISING COOKIES** : those cookies used to advertise within a website. Some of them are used to calculate the value of the advertising offer, to identify individual advertisements and to know which one has been selected and when. Other advertising cookies, such as behavioral and retargeting cookies are used to deduce the “profile” of the User and to offer later him/her advertisements in line with his/her behavior on the network (thus outside of the websites of Mosaicoon) and presumably in line with the interests manifested. This “profile” is anonymous and the information collected by these cookies does not permit to trace the User’s identity. The advertising services are mainly provided by outside suppliers. The use of the data collected by these external operators through cookies is subject to their privacy policies and thus those cookies are identified with the names of the individuals listed in the table below.

These cookies are not directly controllable by Mosaicoon, which cannot hence guarantee the use that third parties/owners make of the information collected. More information about privacy and their use are available directly on the websites of the respective managers; to easily manage third-party cookies we suggest you to refer to the website of  [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ch-it). This website allows, in fact, to find out which cookies are enabled on your computer, indicating the name of the company that produces and/or manages them.
