**Data retention**

When Planbox acts as the data processor, a separately executed Master Service Agreement or Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) between Planbox and the Customer defines Planbox retention policy and data processing obligations.

When Planbox acts as the data controller, Planbox will only store your personal data for the duration necessary and in a manner permitted by the Regulations or other applicable laws. We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
