						<ul>
							<li><strong>With your consent.</strong>  You may be asked to consent to have your contact information shared with third-party business partners.  For example, CBS Local Web Sites sometimes run contests with prizes provided by an advertiser (e.g. a contest with a prize provided by the advertiser).  When entering such a contest you may be asked if the third party may contact you to provide information about their products or services or to provide you with special promotional opportunities.</li>
							<li><strong>Authorized third-party service providers.</strong>  We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, and data processing.  These third parties are allowed to use your contact information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose.</li>
							<li><strong>Sweepstakes, contests, or promotions.</strong>  When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, your information may be disclosed to sponsors and to third parties who help administer the promotion, including in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment.  Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.  Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law.</li>
							<li><strong>Co-Branded Partners.</strong>  Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a CBS Local Web Site may jointly offer a service or feature.  You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner's name will be featured prominently.  You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner.  In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner.  Please note that the Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.</li>

						<p>Most CBS Local Web Sites are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13.

In those instances where a CBS Local Web Site has actual knowledge that it collects information from children, or offers a service directed toward children, it will comply with applicable laws, including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

						<p>Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser.

						<p>CBS Local Web Sites use cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Web Sites.  For example, if you register on a CBS Local Web Site, the Web Site may save your password, so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit.</li>

Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.

						<p>In order to customize your experience on the CBS Local Web Sites, we may use <a href="#cwbt">cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</a> to collect information about the content and advertisements you view on our Web Sites.  Based on this information, and other information we may collect about you, we try to infer your interests and show content and advertising that is more relevant to you.

						<p>We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which this Children's Privacy Policy is posted.  The following guidelines supplement our general <a href="#"> Privacy Policy</a> and follow the rules set by the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other applicable laws.  "Child" means an individual under 13 years of age or an individual under 18 where the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information about such an individual is restricted by applicable law.  When we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>

					<h5 class="blue full-width">Information We Collect<a name="kidinfo">&nbsp;</a></h5>
					<div class="backtop full-width">
						<p>Children can enjoy content and features on CBS Local Web Sites without directly providing contact information.  However, children who wish to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and certain other special activities may need to provide information such as first name, user name, password, email address, date of birth, city and state of residence, and gender.</p>
						<p>In the course of participating in interactive features such as chat rooms and message boards, a child may provide us with additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her postings.  Some information, including information collected through <a href="#cwbt"> cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</a>, may be collected automatically.  For more information, see the "<a href="#source">information we collect automatically</a>" section of our general Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p>If we collect, use, or disclose contact information collected from a child, we will provide notice and obtain parental consent in accordance with applicable law.</p>
						<p>We do not condition a child's participation in an online activity on the child's providing more contact information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
						<br>
					</p></div>
					<h5 class="blue full-width">Use of Information<a name="kiduse">&nbsp;</a></h5>
					<div class="backtop full-width">

						<li>Send a newsletter, electronic card, and other communication requested by the child;</li>
						<li>Enable a child's participation in certain interactive features such as games, contests, message boards, chat rooms, song requests, and online scrolling tickers; and</li>
						<li>Respond to correspondence sent by the child.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p>In addition, we may use a parent's contact information to communicate with the parent regarding the child's activities on CBS Local Web Sites.  For example, if a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we may use the parent's contact information to conduct prize fulfillment.</p>

					<h4 class="blue full-width">CBS Local Digital Media Privacy Policy FAQ </h4>
					<div class="backtop full-width">
						<p>Our Privacy Policy provides visitors of CBS Local Web Sites with a single, uniform policy consistent with our core <a href="index.html">Privacy Principles</a>.  Below, please find answers to some questions about our Privacy Policy.  To review the Privacy Policy, <a href="#">click here</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Why are you updating your Privacy Policy?</span>
						We are updating our privacy policy to provide current company and other information, including contact information.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Have you made any substantively material changes to the Privacy Policy?</span>
						No, we have not made any substantively material changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p><span class="question">What are the "core" privacy principles that CBS Local follows?</span>
						Trust is a cornerstone of our mission at CBS Local.  We are committed to gaining and maintaining your trust by following five key principles: transparency, choice, access, security, and accountability.  For more information, <a href="http://policies.cbslocal.com/privacy/">click here</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Will you share my contact information with third parties?</span>
						Like other businesses, we share contact information (such as name and email address) with vendors who process credit card transactions, with business partners who co-sponsor our Web Sites, and when we have consent from our users.  For more information, <a href="#disclosure">click here</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Can you give me an example when you will share my information with third parties?</span>
						If you enter a sweepstakes that is jointly sponsored by a third party, we may share your contact information with that third party.  Also, if you seek to download a free song from a band or listen to a free stream of a band, we might ask you to consent to have your contact information shared with third parties who may contact you about information concerning that band's appearances.  This allows us to offer you valuable content for free.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Does CBS Local share contact information with other web sites owned by CBS Corporation?</span>
						As CBS Corporation continues to expand its online offerings, we will share information with other web sites owned by our parent, CBS Corporation, so we can better inform our users about products and services in which they may be interested.  It is up to you as to whether you want to hear about special offers from us or from other business units owned by CBS Corporation.  You can choose not to receive such marketing emails when you register with us, in any such email we send, or by <a href="mailto:localcontactus@cbs.com">contacting us</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Do you use my data for advertising on CBS Local Web Sites?</span>
						Like other web sites, we are able to offer free content and services through the revenue we receive from advertising on our Web Sites.  We hope you value the advertising you see on our Web Sites, and we may use some data about you to tailor advertisements to your apparent interests.  For example, if you visit a CBS Local Web Site and view articles about computers, we may serve you with a computer-related advertisement when you visit another CBS Local Web Site.  This advertising does not result in you seeing more ads; rather, it just means the ads you would otherwise see are more relevant.  To learn more, <a href="#ad">click here</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="question">Does CBS Local allow third parties to collect and use data about me for online advertising?</span>
						Our advertisers may have relationships with third parties who deliver their advertisements on our Web Sites.  As part of delivering these ads, the third parties may collect and use information about your activities on our Web Sites (such as the content you have viewed).  These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes.  To learn more, <a href="#onlinead">click here</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="question">What are the benefits of the Privacy Policy to me?</span>
						We hope you will find our Privacy Policy easier to read and understand across all CBS Local Web Sites. We are committed to gaining and maintaining your trust.  If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please <a href="mailto:localcontactus@cbs.com">contact us</a>.</p>
