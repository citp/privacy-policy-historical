	<p>
		This Privacy Policy was last updated in December 2008.
	</p>
	<p>
		PlayHaven.com, a service of Medium Entertainment, Inc., ("PlayHaven", "we", or "us") takes the privacy
		and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting and using the Web Site and Services
		or by registering for the Services and creating an Account, you acknowledge that you accept the practices
		and policies outlined in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized
		terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the PlayHaven Terms of Service that you can find at
		http://www.playhaven.com/about/terms and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">What This Privacy Policy Covers</div>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy describes PlayHaven's practices with respect to Personal Information and Anonymous Information
		that we collect when you use the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information
		that is collected by third parties that PlayHaven does not own or control or that do not support PlayHaven in providing
		the Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>"Personal Information"</b> is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or
		phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>"Anonymous Information"</b> means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous
		Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from Users.
	</p>
	<p><b>
		BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL
		INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
	</b></p>
	<p><b>		
		YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES)
		WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICES OR
		SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.
	</b></p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Personal Information We Collect</div>
	<p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you register for the Services and create an Account to become a Member, we collect your username, your e-mail address, a password,
			and your date of birth for your Account.
		</li>
		<li>
			When you create your Profile, we also collect the following additional information on an optional basis: you real name, your sex, your AIM,
			MSN, and Yahoo user names, and other information about you that you decide to provide in your Profile. You can also provide your XBOX 360 Gamer ID,
			Steam, and PSN ID and your Wii Friend Code. You can also upload a photo for your Profile (the "Mug Shot") and you can provide information about the
			games you own and play. We may also collect other information about you and how you play games on an optional basis, including, but not limited to,
			the city, state, and country where you live and your playing schedule.
		</li>
		<li>
			When you take the PlayHaven Match Test, we collect information about your gaming preferences.
		</li>
		<li>
			When you use the Services, you may add friends, send messages, perform searches and queries, form guilds or clans, contribute to game information,
			and transmit information through various channels and we collect all the information associated therewith.
		</li>
		<li>
			When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="privacy_title">Personal Information Collected Via Technology</div>	
	<p>
		As you use the Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address and the browser that you use to
		visit the Web Site. PlayHaven also stores a small text file called a "Cookie" on your computer to store your login information (if any) and your personal
		preferences for the Services. PlayHaven may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your
		computer until you delete them). While you will still be able to use the Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Services may not
		function as effectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the Services, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Personal Information Collected From Other Sources</div>
	<p>
		We may receive Personal Information about you from outside the Web Site, such as telephone, fax, mail, or from third parties that provide services for us that are related to the Services.
		We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Services.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Use of Information We Collect</div>
	<p>
		In general, information (including Personal Information) you submit to us, or to third parties that support us in collecting information, is used by us to provide you and others with the
		Services, to match you with other gamers, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		PlayHaven provides the Services that are intended to help gamers form and maintain friendships with other gamers. As such, the information you provide is intended to describe yourself to
		other gamers. One of the ideas behind our Services is that Members of the Services share gaming-related information with other Members. Therefore, you should assume that any information
		(including any Personal Information you may choose to provide, but excluding your registration information) that you post in generally available sections of the Services will be shared with
		other Members of the Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with notifications related to your use of the Services, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to our Web Site, we will use the information that you have provided in connection with sending the invitation, such as your friend's email address, to send your friend
		a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Web Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may also create
		Anonymous Information on how you use the Services. We may use this Anonymous Information for internal purposes, such as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance the Services, and we also
		reserve the right to use and disclose any Anonymous Information at our sole discretion. Any information that you provide that is not Personal Information (such as usage patterns, information about
		games you play, and so forth) may be used by us for any reason, at our sole discretion.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Feedback</div>
	<p>
		If you provide feedback about the Services to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect
		any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Disclosure of Personal Information</div>
	<p>
		Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on behalf of or with us to provide you with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate with our Users.
		However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help us provide the Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may sometime include advertisements on the Services for products or services, as well as products and services offered by other companies. These advertisements may target a particular set of Users
		(for example, advertisements for a roleplaying game might be displayed more often to people who have included the names of roleplaying games in their Profile). We do not provide any personally-identifying
		information to the advertising servers or agencies that display these advertisements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), we may in the future. We may share some or all
		of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the event PlayHaven goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be
		among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of PlayHaven or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this
		Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to PlayHaven sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a)
		comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you and to enforce the Privacy Policy; or (c) to protect
		and defend the rights or property of us, other Users, or third parties.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Choices Regarding Personal Information</div>
	<p>
		We will include unsubscribe instructions in each newsletter or promotional communication you receive from us.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Services, the Terms of Service, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary
		to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate the Account you
		may have with us. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your Account and Profile information from our live databases and all the information and data stored
		for such Account and Profile in the Services. PlayHaven will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of you information. 
	</p>
	<p>
		When you update information, we sometimes keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. When we delete information
		that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives. 
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Links to Other Web Sites</div>
	<p>
		The Services may contain links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by PlayHaven. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such
		web sites or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other web sites. Please be aware that
		the terms of the Privacy Policy do not apply to any outside web sites.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Privacy of Minors</div>
	<p>
		We do not intentionally collect or maintain information from persons under the age of 13.
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Security and Confidentiality</div>
	<p>
		PlayHaven has put in place commercially reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, no company,
		including PlayHaven, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. 
	</p>
	<div class="privacy_title">Changes in this Privacy Policy</div>
	<p>
		As part of the Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy is subject to occasional amendment, in accordance with the terms of the Terms of Service.
