**Cookies**  
A cookie is a file that stores data on a user’s computer or returns it to the web server. The data in the file is information a user has entered using an online form or general information about the visiting user, such as IP address and country. A cookie can store information temporarily (session cookies) or permanently (regular cookie).

ASPB uses permanent and temporary cookies for logging in to remember you when you’ve logged in. Cookies help the site remember your login upon return to eliminate your need to log in again. They do not store any personal or financial information. You can also opt out from our use of cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior by choosing “No” beside the “Save login:” option when logging in to use only a temporary session cookie. Session cookies will only last up to two hours without activity on the site. We also use session cookies in our forms to remember what you’ve filled out from one page to another in a form. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our website.

**Security**  
ASPB has taken all reasonable precautions to secure the personal information available through the online community. The ASPB Online Community is password protected to allow access by registered individuals only. Although this precaution should effectively protect any personal information available through the ASPB Online Community from abuse or outside interference, a certain degree of privacy risk is faced any time information is shared over the Internet. ASPB is committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Our websites are maintained on secure servers. All our suppliers and contractors meet the standards we require. Staff training is undertaken regularly, and checks are made by IT staff to ensure data quality is maintained. ASPB runs a stringent Internet E-mail Security Policy. All e-mail received from and destined for Internet hosts is scanned for threats. The policy covers the following areas:

  * All messages that contain viruses are quarantined and deleted.
  * The following are quarantined, checked and then released as appropriate: 
    * Messages that contain attachments that are known virus carriers.
    * Messages that contain encrypted data, password protected documents or have encrypted signatures.
    * Messages that contain movies or music files.
    * Messages that contain words and/or phrases that are common in SPAM messages
    * Messages that contain English profanity
  * In most of these cases a warning message is returned to the sender explaining that the message has been quarantined. Quarantine areas within the email security systems at ASPB are checked at regular intervals throughout the working day. Messages that are deemed ‘good’ will be released to their intended destination.
  * Financial information may be collected online when ordering publications or in making payment for membership. The online forms are always encrypted with an SSL secured site using https. The SSL certificates can be verified by selecting the logo to the right. This encrypts the information during the transaction so as to secure the cardholder data from access by unauthorized users.



Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system is completely secure. If you feel that the security of your account or interaction with us has been compromised, please contact us immediately. If such a disclosure does occur, we will contact you as soon as possible to explain what has happened and take all steps required of us to meet our obligations under the relevant data protection legislation.

**Communications from Underage Individuals**  
ASPB will not initiate communication with any individual under the age of 18. If an underage individual initiates communication for specific information on plant biology, we will respond to their email with generic information and ask them to involve their parent/guardian in further communications. Public forums as defined below are typically not monitored by ASPB directly. Parents should caution their children when they are participating on any public forum.

**External Links to Other Websites**  
This site contains links to third party websites outside those affiliated to ASPB. ASPB, through its affiliate websites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party websites. Once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over these other websites. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such websites, and such websites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

**Public Forums**  
This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and that you should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
