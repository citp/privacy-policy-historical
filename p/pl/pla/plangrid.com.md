PREVAIL. CAPITALIZED TERMS NOT OTHERWISE DEFINED HEREIN SHALL HAVE
THE MEANING GIVEN THEM IN THE AGREEMENT.
      1.      INFORMATION COLLECTION AND STORAGE
              a.      Information You Provide. When you register an account, Loupe collects
      some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing
      information, email address and home and business postal addresses (“Personal
      Information”). You may also import your contacts by giving Loupe access to your third
      party services (for example, your email account) or social networking information if you
      give Loupe access to your account on social network connection services. You may also
      provide Loupe with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing Content with them.
              b.      Content. Loupe collects, converts and stores the Content you upload,
      download, or access in connection with the Service. If you add Content to your account
      that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, Loupe may associate all or a
      portion of the previous Content with your account rather than storing a duplicate.
              c.      Log Data. When you use the Service, Loupe automatically records data,
      Content, and information (collectively, “Information”) from your desktop, laptop, mobile
      phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device (each, an “Electronic Device”), its
      software, and your activity using the Service. This may include the Electronic Device’s
      Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to
      the Loupe Site or Application, information you search for on the Site or Application,
      locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Electronic Devices, your
      mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration
      information, metadata concerning your Information, and other interactions with the
      Service.
              d.      Cookies. Loupe also uses “cookies” to collect Information and improve
      the Service. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your Electronic Device.


Loupe may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for
future logins to the Service. Loupe may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain
features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to
monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your
browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however,
you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
2.      PERSONAL INFORMATION USAGE
        a.      Personal Information. In the course of using the Service, Loupe may
collect Personal Information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal
Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve the Service, (ii) to administer
your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to
personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates
and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from
Loupe, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those
communications, or update your account settings information.
        b.      Geo-Location Information. Some Devices allow Applications to access
real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). The Application does not
collect such information as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the
future with your consent to improve the Service. Some photos you place on the Site or
the Application may contain recorded location information. Loupe may use this
information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the Information collected from a
Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s
location.
        c.      Analytics. Some Information may also be collected (by Loupe or by a
third party service) using logging and cookies, which can sometimes be correlated with
Personal Information. Loupe uses this information for the above purposes and to monitor
and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase
Service functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization
needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into
effect, Loupe uses Gaug.es. To learn more about the privacy policy of Gaug.es, click

3.      INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
        a.      Your Use. Your Personal Information will be displayed in your profile
page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account.
Any Information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to
know about you. Please consider carefully what Information you disclose in your profile


page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile
information at any time. Loupe may also share or disclose your Information with your
consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see
below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make
some of your Information public. Public Information may be broadly and quickly
disseminated.
        b.      Service Providers, Business Partners and Others. Loupe may use certain
trusted third party companies and individuals to help provide, analyze, and improve the
Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database
management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s
features). These third parties may have access to your Information only for purposes of
performing these tasks on Loupe’s behalf and under obligations similar to those in this
Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, Loupe uses Amazon’s,
Heroku’s and MongoHQ’s storage services to store some of your Information.
        c.      Third-Party Applications. Loupe may share your Information with a third
party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access the Service
through such an application. Loupe is not responsible for what those parties do with your
Information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy
policy acceptable to you.
        d.      Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of
Loupe’s Rights. Loupe may disclose to outside parties Content stored in your account or
on the Site or Application and Information collected about you when Loupe has a good
faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or
compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious
bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of the Service or its users; or (d) to protect
Loupe’s property rights. If Loupe provides your Content to a law enforcement agency as
set forth above, Loupe will remove encryption from the Content before providing them to
law enforcement. However, Loupe will not be able to decrypt any Content that you
encrypted prior to storing them on the Site or in the Application.
        e.      Business Transfers. If Loupe is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale
of all or a portion of its assets, your Information may be transferred as part of that
transaction, but Loupe will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice
on the Site and the Application) of any change in control or use of your Personal
Information or Content, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. Loupe
will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the Information.
        f.      Non-private or Non-Personal Information. Loupe may disclose your non-
private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of the
Service.


4.      CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION.                              If you are a
registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information
provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If
your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire the Service,
you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some
cases Loupe may retain copies of your Information if required by law.
5.      DATA RETENTION. Loupe will retain your Information for as long as your
account is active or as needed to provide the Service. If you wish to cancel your account
or request that your Information no longer be used to provide you the Service, you may
delete your account with Loupe. Loupe may retain and use your Information as
necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
Consistent with these requirements, Loupe will try to delete your Information quickly
upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting Information
from the servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, Loupe
does not delete from the servers files that you have in common with other users.
6.      LOUPE USERS. The Service allows you to make some Content accessible to
the public or to other users. You should be aware that any Information you make
available to other users may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
Your Information may remain even after you cancel your account.
7.      SECURITY. The security of your Information is important to Loupe. When you
enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on order forms, Loupe encrypts
the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Loupe
follows generally accepted standards to protect the Information submitted to the Site or
the Application, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of
electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, Loupe cannot
guarantee its absolute security.
8.      POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN. The Service is not directed to persons under
13. Loupe does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Loupe
with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact Loupe at
support@loupe.io. If Loupe becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided Personal
Information, Loupe will take steps to delete such information from the files.
9.      CONTACT. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact
Loupe at support@loupe.io.
10.     CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY. This Privacy Policy may change from
time to time. If this Privacy Policy is changed in a way that Loupe believes materially


reduces your rights, Loupe will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And
Loupe may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to
use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the
revised Privacy Policy.
