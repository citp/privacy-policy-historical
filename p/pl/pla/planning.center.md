# Planning Center Privacy Policy

We collect user information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business. When a user registers for any of the Services we must ask for information such as the user’s name, company name, email address, billing address, and/or credit card information. If you created a new account with us, you will have been asked to check a box indicating your agreement to provide this data in order to use our services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this policy, please do not use our services. 

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. 

We use collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research. The information we collect is used to improve the content and quality of the Services. User information is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services the user has requested, when the user has given us permission to share such information. This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with data that is aggregated and/or de-identified so it is no longer associated with an identifiable user. 

We may share your information with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. These services may include: 

  * Fulfilling orders and delivering packages 
  * Payment processing 
  * Providing customer service 
  * Sending marketing communications 
  * Fulfilling subscription services 
  * Conducting research and analysis 
  * Providing cloud computing infrastructure 



A list of these third parties, along with a way to subscribe to updates, is available at <https://planning.center/subprocessors/>. 

In certain situations, Ministry Centered Technologies may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. 

We do not use your personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making. However, we may do so in order to fulfill obligations imposed by law, in which case we will inform you of any such processing and provide you with an opportunity to object. 

In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, Ministry Centered Technologies reserves the right to transfer all of our user information to a separate entity. In this event, we will notify our users when user information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
