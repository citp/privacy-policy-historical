Occasionally, and subject to applicable laws, Platts also makes our customers’ names and e-mail addresses and other similar contact information available to other businesses within The McGraw-Hill Companies, as well as to other reputable information companies, so that they can inform you about other products and services that may interest you. If at any time you would like your name removed from lists that are shared for these purposes, simply click the easy-to-use External Distribution Opt-Out button at the bottom of this screen for prompt removal of your name.
