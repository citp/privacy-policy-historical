Contacting us via email or by registering with Platts under our free email alerts, subscribe and checkout areas, reveals your email address and any other contact information (such as phone number or postal address) you provide through this site. We will use your contact information (just the contact information not information collected through cookies) to help us process your order, service your account and respond to your inquiries.

Our site uses cookies to customize your experience on this site. A cookie is a text-only string of information that a Web site transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the Web site can remember who you are and your preferences. There are different types of cookies. A “session” cookie is a cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s browser closes. A “persistent” cookie is a cookie that expires based on a time set by the Web server. “Persistent” cookies help to identify the visitor and his/her preferences upon returning to a Web site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web site. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique persistent or session cookie on your browser. These third-party ad servers may also collect and use personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you.

In order to change these cookie preferences, you must change your browser’s preferences to disable cookies or delete cookies. Please note that disabling cookies for some services may affect the ability to use that service. Security information is specific to each browser and operating system.

Occasionally, and subject to applicable laws, Platts also makes our customers’ names and e-mail addresses and other similar contact information available to other businesses within The McGraw-Hill Companies, as well as to other reputable information companies, so that they can inform you about other products and services that may interest you. If at any time you would like your name removed from lists that are shared for these purposes, simply click the easy-to-use External Distribution Opt-Out button at the bottom of this screen for prompt removal of your name. 

Throughout the site we offer you the chance to send a colleague an article or a note telling them about the site. Feel free to take advantage of these opportunities knowing that we will protect your colleague's privacy. We will only use your colleague's email address in order to send the message you asked us to send. We do not hold this information in any database for any subsequent use by Platts.
