  <div class="system-doc__wrap b-layout b-html"><h1>Privacy and Cookie Policy</h1> <p>Plarium Global Ltd, having company ID number 514563956, with headquarters located in Israel (“Plarium” or “we”) is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our online users (“users” or “you”). This Online Privacy and Cookie Policy (the “Policy”) has been crafted to inform you as to the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with any Plarium game or application (“Service”). Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited only to information collected by Plarium through use of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Plarium does not own or control.</p> <p>When signing up for the Service, you are invited to agree with this Policy and the processing of your data, including your personal information, in the manner provided in this Policy. In any event, any use of the Service will be construed as your agreement with this Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.</p> <p>It is advised that you review this Policy regularly as it may be amended from time to time, in accordance with clause 12 below.</p> <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED</h2> <p>Plarium’s primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. This includes sending you electronic communications related to the Service, from which you can unsubscribe at any time using the instructions in such communications.</p> <p>When you install any of the Plarium games or applications, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through the social networking website in accordance with their policies and terms.</p> <p>The types of personal information collected in accordance with the activities listed above may vary depending on the activity. Personal information may include:</p> <ul><li>Your name;</li>     <li>User identification number;</li>     <li>Email address;</li>     <li>Home address;</li>     <li>Phone number.</li></ul> <p>Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as your IP address (in some jurisdictions), but that may be considered part of an individual’s personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.</p> <p>Additionally, we may acquire information from you through: </p><ul><li>Your access and participation in message boards on the Service;</li>     <li>Your email of a question to our customer support;</li>     <li>Your purchase of a virtual product of any type.</li></ul> <p>When you play a Plarium game, on Plarium's website at <a target="_blank" href="http://plarium.com/">www.plarium.com</a> (the "Site") or on your social network page or on someone else’s page or through your mobile device, we may record information regarding the use of that game, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.</p> <p>The Service will also record game play information such as your high scores or game session duration. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through Plarium’s applications, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email address and content.</p> <p>When you pay for products offered for purchase though the Service, we will also collect your billing address and complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment. Our payment processing service provider may also retain this information to enable you to purchase additional items through our Service without having to re-enter it each time. We do not directly access, store or collect your credit card information and we will not use your payment information we collect except as needed to fulfill your purchase and/or communicate with you regarding your transaction.</p> <p>Plarium will never at any time ask you for your credit card or bank account information, your login or password, or national identification numbers via any unsolicited means, including email and telephone calls.</p> <h2>IOS AND ANDROID PLATFORMS</h2> <p>If you play Plarium games on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including iPads and tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including Media Access Control (MAC) address, and possibly IP address. In certain games we will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, character name, geo-location (based on your Internet Protocol ("IP") address) or e-mail address. This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends.</p> <p>We may collect your location based information for the purpose of providing you with an optimized game experience.</p> <p>We will not share this information with any third party. If you no longer wish to allow us to track or use this information, you may turn it off at the device level.&nbsp;Please note, the application may not work properly if we are unable to tell where you are coming from (country specific).</p> <p>In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the Plarium games you are playing.</p> <p>We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you.&nbsp;You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.</p> <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p> <h2>COOKIES</h2> <p>Like many websites, Plarium uses server log files and automated data collection tools, such as cookies and web beacons (collectively, “Data Collection Tools”) when you access our Service and/or use the Site. We tie the information gathered by these means to our customers’ personally identifiable information. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain technical information that your computer or device sends to our Site such as your IP addresses, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, clickstream data, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, game information and the date and time of activity on our Service, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this technical information with your ID number for our internal use. By using our Service, you consent to our use of cookies, web beacons and Data Collection Tools.</p> <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons, including to: (i) analyze the usage of our Site and Service; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; (iii) manage advertising; (iv) allow you to more easily login to our Site and Service; (iv) help make your visit to our Site and/or use of our Service more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.</p> <p>We may also employ web beacons or other technology for a variety of reasons such as: (i) allowing us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an email was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation;</p> <p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the type of cookies you allow or refuse cookies all together. We invite you to visit the support websites of the various browsers you may use to learn on how to block the use of Data Collection Tools. However, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site and/or Service if you refuse/disable cookies.</p> <h2>THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h2> <p>Please note that third party partners/providers, such as companies delivering advertisements in our games or on the website and/or Service, may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices and providers are subject to their own policies.</p> <p>Our services may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which include Google Analytics. Such third parties may use cookies, APIs, and SDKs in our services to enable them to collect and analyze user information on our behalf. The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier, MAC address, geo-location information, and IP address for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. This Policy does not cover the use of tracking tools from third parties.&nbsp;We do not have access or control over these third parties.</p> <p>Google Analytics</p> <p>Plarium also uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this Site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Site. Plarium uses the information it gets from Google Analytics only to improve this Site. Google Analytics collects only the&nbsp;IP&nbsp;address assigned to you on the date you visit this Site, rather than your name or other identifying information. Plarium does not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.</p> <p>Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this Site is restricted by the&nbsp;Google Analytics Terms of Use&nbsp;(as&nbsp;amended for government websites) and the&nbsp;Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Site by&nbsp;disabling cookies&nbsp;on your browser or mobile device.</p> <h2>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2> <p>Except as set forth in this Policy, Plarium does not share your personal information with any third parties. In the event we offer services or promotions where your information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. We also may share your information with third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.</p> <p>We may share your information with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, email campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing the services for us, these companies may access your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by us for the purpose of our requested service.</p> <p>In conjunction with the running of our games we may partner with a third party to assist us in providing you with our Service. We will share the information you provide us through your social network such as (1) your first and last name, (2) your profile picture or its URL, (3) your user identification number of the pertinent social network, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile picture (4) the login email you provide to the pertinent social network upon registration; (5) game play information with these third parties so they may facilitate the use of our Service as well as contact you about other games which may be of interest to you, service notifications and to solicit your feedback and input. If you do not wish to have this information shared please do not use our Service. If you wish to no longer have your personal information used by our partners you may contact us at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://support.plarium.com/index.php?/default/">support.plarium.com</a>&nbsp;and we will facilitate your request to the partner.</p> <p>We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain technical information and other non-personal information to show general demographic and preference information among Plarium users. We may also allow advertisers to collect technical information and other non-personal information, which they may share with us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).</p> <p>Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only as described in this Policy.</p> <h2>PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2> <p>We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control. Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To help protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. You are also responsible for all uses of the Plarium games and applications by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been compromised or misused.</p> <h2>SECURITY</h2> <p>We have implemented commercially reasonable technical, physical, managerial and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use, disclose, or alter your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information through these mediums.</p> <p>In the event that personal information has been or is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Plarium will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p> <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable measures (such as requiring a unique password) to verify your identity before permitting you access to your account or the Service. You are responsible to maintain the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communication or interaction through the Site or Plarium's authorized social networking at all times.</p> <h2>ACCESSING, CORRECTING AND DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2> <p>Plarium takes your privacy seriously and works in a transparent way. In that sense, upon providing sufficient identification (to protect others' privacy), you can request information from us about the personal information we hold in relation to you and you can correct any inaccurate data we hold.</p> <p>Furthermore, you can change or delete any personal information by changing the applicable information found in your Plarium account. However, by deleting the entirety of this information your account may become deactivated.</p> <h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES OF APPLICATIONS</h2> <p>Links from the Plarium applications to third party Web sites or applications are provided for your convenience. In addition, content in Plarium applications may be hosted by other websites or applications. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages or applications is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy, not ours. These other sites and applications maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information. It is up to you to review those policies yourself.</p> <h2>POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h2> <p>Plarium's Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 and Plarium does not knowingly collect nor solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allows such persons to access our Service. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Site or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents or guardians for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p> <h2>COMMUNICATION</h2> <p>If you contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply. We may use your personal information submitted in your communications to contact and respond to you.</p> <h2>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2> <p>Plarium may amend this Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Service or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Policy when you use the Service after such changes have been first posted. If you object to any change, your sole recourse shall be to immediately terminate your account and cease using the Site and Service.</p> <h2>QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</h2> <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at Plarium, please contact our <a target="_blank" href="http://support.plarium.com/index.php?/default/">Support</a>.</p></div>
