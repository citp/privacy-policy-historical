_**Normal Viewing Information**_

As you visit the site, Planet Source Code does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. Planet Source Code does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the site. Planet Source Code servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ads effectiveness on behalf of Planet Source Code clients and customers. 

_**The Cookie Principle**_

Planet Source Code uses cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you first come to the site, Planet Source Code assigns a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie."  This cookie is used to maintain your personal settings such as the world that you are browsing in (...so you only have to choose it once at the beginning of the site, and don't have to choose it over and over).  Cookies are not used to store personal information about you. 

_**Email addresses and Demographic Information given to Planet Source Code**_

Users who sign up for and use advanced features of Planet Source Code, such as code submission, voting, Code of the Day, and submitting feedback will be asked for additional information including email address and possibly demographic information. We will not market this information to other companies unless you give us permission to do so. Email addresses are used to verify the user's true identity and prevent fraud, while demographic information is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring their effectiveness on behalf of Planet Source Code clients and customers. If a user signs up for an opt-in email list, they will always be given the opportunity to opt out of it at any time, using a link at the bottom of the email.
