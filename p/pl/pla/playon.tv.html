<p>We at MediaMall Technologies take privacy seriously. We would never sell any of your private information. Any sensitive information that you provide to us will be protected and never disseminated to other third parties. We do use private information to sell and deliver our PlayOn and PlayLater Service, and the Privacy Policy described here governs our use of that information.</p>

<p>
If you have questions or concerns regarding privacy at MediaMall Technologies, you should first contact our Privacy Office via email at privacy@playon.tv.</p>

<h3>About MediaMall Technologies and the information we collect</h3>
 
<p>MediaMall Technologies (MMT) has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our dedication to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This Privacy Policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on websites or through software managed by MMT. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.</p>

<a name="personalinfo"></a>

<h3>Information Collected</h3>

<h4>Your Personally Identifiable Information:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Our blog, forum, newsletter, and trial registration forms require you to give us certain information such as your name, email address and password. You may always choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content. At any time, you may choose to opt-out of the receipt of any promotional communications by clicking on the opt-out link provided at the bottom of each e-mail and following the instructions.</li>
<li>You may also enter usernames and passwords for use to access your accounts on other services via PlayOn and PlayLater (Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube, as examples).</li>
<li>If you place an order for one of our products, you may be required to enter your credit card number and information, as well as your address and/or other contact information.Our credit card transaction data is processed and stored by PayPal, TrialPay and Litle — please see the <a href="#security">section on security</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cookies:</h4>
<p>MediaMall Technologies wants to optimize your experience by ensuring that the most relevant information, searches and offers are displayed to you while using the Site. A common manner in which to do this is by placing cookies on your computer. Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when you visit the Site, and which may be correlated with your Personally Identifiable Information in our log files.</p>

<h4>Pixel Tags: </h4>
<p>MMT uses pixel tags to gather information about the emails we send to our users. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access our email provider's server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with your email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the message, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies. For more information about cookies and how to disable their use, see the section below on "Use of Cookies."</p>

<h4>User Names and Passwords to Third-Party Sites:</h4>
<p>Any passwords to third-party sites that you provide will be stored encrypted on your local PC, and will only be used in secure channel communication with the respective sites. We will never ask for your login information to third-party sites, nor will this information be sent to our servers.</p>

<h4>Tracking:</h4>
<p>Our software sends installation tracking to our servers, which is used to calculate the raw total numbers of licensed and trial installations of our products. License keys for licensed installations are also validated by our server.</p>

<h4>Support Requests:</h4>
<p>Support requests send a copy of diagnostic logs that enable us to assess the problem you are having. These logs contain binary data about your PlayOn and PlayLater  installation. The information in these logs includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>PC information: operating system version, CPU, RAM, free HDD space, security software status, etc.</li>
<li>Basic UPnP communication information with the DLNA device(s).</li>
<li>Video playback attempts and their timestamps, as well as playback status (errors, serve rates, etc.).</li>
<li>Usernames for Netflix and Hulu accounts (not the respective passwords)</li>
</ul>

<p>Without this information, we cannot support your PlayOn or PlayLater installation.</p>

<a name="personalinfo"></a>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>

<h4>Use of Personally Identifiable Information by MediaMall Technologies:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We use the collected Personally Identifiable Information to verify you and to contact you in connection with your transactions, postings and other activities on the Site, to send you product updates and announcements and for general corporate communications. </li>
<li>MMT uses your Personally Identifiable Information to help us provide you with personalized content, advertising, and commercial messages (collectively, "Content"). </li>
<li>MMT does not sell, share or otherwise provide any "Personally Identifiable Information" you give to us unless required by law, court order or as required to technically operate the service, or to complete a transaction or order. </li>
<li>MMT does reserve the right to share your Personally Identifiable Information with its parent, subsidiary or affiliated entities.</li>
</ul>

<h4>When We May Disclose Your Personally Identifiable Information, MMT Communications Content, Data and Information:</h4>
<p>MMT may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or the contents of your private communications if required to do so by law or court order. Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be disclosed if necessary in order to complete a transaction such as the fulfillment of an order or purchase placed by you. </p>

<p>It is possible that as we continue to develop the PlayOn and PlayLater Service and business, MMT and/or related assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. </p>
