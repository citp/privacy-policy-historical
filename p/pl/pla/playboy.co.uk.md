We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. By using or navigating this Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy or any modified Policy as posted.

**What information do we collect and what do we do with the information we collect?**

We collect personal information that you provide to us such as your name, e-mail address, street address and telephone number. We also collect credit card information from you. We generally collect this personal information on our registration and order forms when you sign up to receive products or services from our Site. We may also collect information from our online surveys such as age, gender and income level.

We also collect IP addresses and anonymous demographic information and may use this data to: tailor your experience at our sites; provide content in which we think you may be interested; display content according to your preferences; and analyse traffic to our sites.

We use the information provided to us to fulfil your order or request; to provide you with information about our services, some of our partners and third party companies in which we think you may be interested; and to contact you when necessary.

Anonymous demographic information will be shared with advertisers and market researchers on an aggregate basis.

We may develop and use, in our sole discretion, consumer research which may be based on your use of our services.

Personal information collected on the sites is stored and processed in the United KingdomUSA and by using our sites you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**Do we share the information we collect with third parties?**

In some cases, we will share information we collect (including personal information or anonymous demographic information) with third party companies with whom we partner to co-promote and administer sweepstakes and contests on our sites.

We may also share information we collect with third party service providers to manage certain aspects of the services we provide, such as maintaining our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for products and services you purchase through the sites.

We may also disclose your information in special cases if required to do so by law, court order or other governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of Playboy TV UK/Benelux Limited, another user or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.

**What information will third-party advertisers get from the sites?**

The sites allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise the advertising content you see.

The sites do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific programme or feature for which you will have the ability to opt in or opt out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks the sites to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men aged 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men aged 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt out of certain practices. The sites' privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers, which is subsequently shared with the sites, is maintained and handled by the  sites in accordance with this privacy policy.

**What information is Publicly Available?**

When you create an account on the Site, some information regarding your account and your account activity will be provided to other users of the Site.
