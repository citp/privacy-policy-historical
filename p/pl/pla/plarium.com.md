# Privacy and Cookie Policy | Plarium.com

Plarium Global Ltd, having company ID number 514563956, with headquarters located in Israel (“Plarium” or “we”) is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our online users (“users” or “you”). This Online Privacy and Cookie Policy (the “Policy”) has been crafted to inform you as to the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with any Plarium game or application (“Service”). Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited only to information collected by Plarium through use of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Plarium does not own or control.

When signing up for the Service, you are invited to agree with this Policy and the processing of your data, including your personal information, in the manner provided in this Policy. In any event, any use of the Service will be construed as your agreement with this Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.

It is advised that you review this Policy regularly as it may be amended from time to time, in accordance with clause 12 below.

## INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED

Plarium’s primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. This includes sending you electronic communications related to the Service, from which you can unsubscribe at any time using the instructions in such communications.

When you install any of the Plarium games or applications, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through the social networking website in accordance with their policies and terms.

The types of personal information collected in accordance with the activities listed above may vary depending on the activity. Personal information may include:

  * Your name;
  * User identification number;
  * Email address;
  * Home address;
  * Phone number.



Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as your IP address (in some jurisdictions), but that may be considered part of an individual’s personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.

Additionally, we may acquire information from you through: 

  * Your access and participation in message boards on the Service;
  * Your email of a question to our customer support;
  * Your purchase of a virtual product of any type.



When you play a Plarium game, on Plarium's website at [www.plarium.com](http://plarium.com/) (the "Site") or on your social network page or on someone else’s page or through your mobile device, we may record information regarding the use of that game, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.

The Service will also record game play information such as your high scores or game session duration. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through Plarium’s applications, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email address and content.

When you pay for products offered for purchase though the Service, we will also collect your billing address and complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment. Our payment processing service provider may also retain this information to enable you to purchase additional items through our Service without having to re-enter it each time. We do not directly access, store or collect your credit card information and we will not use your payment information we collect except as needed to fulfill your purchase and/or communicate with you regarding your transaction.

Plarium will never at any time ask you for your credit card or bank account information, your login or password, or national identification numbers via any unsolicited means, including email and telephone calls.

## IOS AND ANDROID PLATFORMS

If you play Plarium games on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including iPads and tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including Media Access Control (MAC) address, and possibly IP address. In certain games we will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, character name, geo-location (based on your Internet Protocol ("IP") address) or e-mail address. This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends.

We may collect your location based information for the purpose of providing you with an optimized game experience.

We will not share this information with any third party. If you no longer wish to allow us to track or use this information, you may turn it off at the device level. Please note, the application may not work properly if we are unable to tell where you are coming from (country specific).

In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the Plarium games you are playing.

We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.

In the event we offer services or promotions where your information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. We also may share your information with third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.

We may share your information with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, email campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing the services for us, these companies may access your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by us for the purpose of our requested service.

In conjunction with the running of our games we may partner with a third party to assist us in providing you with our Service. We will share the information you provide us through your social network such as (1) your first and last name, (2) your profile picture or its URL, (3) your user identification number of the pertinent social network, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile picture (4) the login email you provide to the pertinent social network upon registration; (5) game play information with these third parties so they may facilitate the use of our Service as well as contact you about other games which may be of interest to you, service notifications and to solicit your feedback and input.

If you wish to no longer have your personal information used by our partners you may contact us at [support.plarium.com](http://support.plarium.com/index.php?/default/) and we will facilitate your request to the partner.

We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain technical information and other non-personal information to show general demographic and preference information among Plarium users. We may also allow advertisers to collect technical information and other non-personal information, which they may share with us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).

Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only as described in this Policy.

You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. You are also responsible for all uses of the Plarium games and applications by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been compromised or misused.

## SECURITY

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical, physical, managerial and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use, disclose, or alter your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information through these mediums.

In the event that personal information has been or is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Plarium will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
