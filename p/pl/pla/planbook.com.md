Planbook.com knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy.

**What personally identifiable information does planbook.com collect from me?**

Planbook.com believes that as little personal information as possible should be collected from our users. The personal information we collect for planbook.com is contained on the User Settings page, and the only required item is your email address. 

In addition to the information we collect on the User Settings page, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our support team. Furthermore, when you send e-mail or other communication to planbook.com, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services.

A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We may use cookies to better display our website, to save you time, and to provide better technical support.
