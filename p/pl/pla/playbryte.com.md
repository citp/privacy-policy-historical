**Effective as of April 26, 2012**

PlayBryte has established this Privacy Policy to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for the [www.playbryte.com](http://www.playbryte.com/) website and our Services, and to allow you to make an informed decision about how you will use our Services.  Our "Services" include [www.playbryte.com](http://www.playbryte.com/), the services provided thereon, and all related services, applications, components, programs, software, listings, directories, tools, databases and information made available and utilized.  References to "you" in this Agreement means you, your duly authorized representatives and any entity you may represent in connection with your use of the Services. 

By using our Services, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services. We reserve the right to enter into new or different lines of business with consumers and if and to the extent we do, we may display a different privacy policy to the consumer for such lines of business. 

This Privacy Policy addresses only our practices with respect to information we collect in the course of using our Services and does not apply to information about you that might be collected by a third party website or an offering linked to or otherwise accessible from our Services.  Any information collected, obtained and/or used by any such third parties is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.  We encourage you to review the policies of such third parties. Finally, to the extent any of our Services are undertaken in conjunction with or as a co-branded service with a third party, then both our Privacy Policy and such third party's privacy policy may apply. 

**1.              ****Collection of Information**

PlayBryte does not, generally, track or maintain personally identifiable information about consumers that use our Services. The only personally-identifiable information collected through the use of our Services is gathered upon your contacting us so that we may respond to your questions or comments.  When you use or interact with our Services, we may collect certain anonymous information that is not sufficient to permit someone to identify you by name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, driver's license or other government-issued identification.  The anonymous information we may have access to, obtain, retain and use may include: 

  * Information about your use of our Services, such as the frequency with which you use them, how you use and interact with them, when you visit them, and your responses to the offerings and advertisements made available to you through them, among other things; and 
  * Information of a technical nature that may be gathered or received when you use the Services, including, without limitation, the following: 
    * The type of browser you are using when using our Services, including your browser's "user agent" (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, and other browsers); 
    * Your operating system type, whether Mac OS, or Windows, and which version of Windows;
    * Your Internet protocol (IP) address and information about the version of any software comprising a portion of the Services that you use;

All of the foregoing information is collectively referred to hereinafter as "Anonymous Information".  We may also supplement Anonymous Information with additional information from other third parties in some cases.  Additionally, those portions of the Services comprised of software have been configured to communicate to us any information relating to computer errors arising from use of such software, without providing any notice to you of the delivery of such communications. Such communications may include the configuration settings applicable at the time of the error. We use this data to help us clarify and fix performance issues with and to improve the software and the Services. 

**2. Use of Information**

(a) Anonymous Information is used to (i) operate and improve upon the Services, including all constituent parts of the Services such as the software, the websites and the various offerings, among other things, (ii) research and analyze your use of the Services, and (iii) present you with offers for other products, offerings, programs, features and/or services that may be of interest to you.

Prior to accepting any files from any Internet user, including those from an account that appears familiar to you, we highly recommend verifying that the person sending you such files is the person you believe he or she is.  You should be extremely careful about accepting files from users you do not trust, from users you do not know, or from users whose identity you have not been able to confirm. You should also be aware that communications sent over the Internet are not secure unless they are encrypted.  PlayBryte does not encrypt your communications through the Services.

As such, PlayBryte cannot accept any responsibility for any unauthorized access to your communications made through the Services or any loss of data.
