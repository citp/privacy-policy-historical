<h1>PlagiarismChecker.com Privacy Policy</h1>

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for www.plagiarismchecker.com, its applications, products, software various related services (together referred to as the "Services"). The Services are provided by PlagiarismChecker.com and its parent, affiliates, business divisions and subsidiaries (referred to as "us" or "we"). We are committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of the Services. 
</p>
<p>
You agree that this Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Service for www.plagiarismchecker.com, and by accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the Services. 
</p>

<h2>1. Changes to the Policy. </h2>
<p>
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We made provide notice of such changes issuing an e-mail to the e-mail address listed by registered users and/or by posting a notice about our revised Privacy Policy on the Services. You agree to assume the responsibility to (a) visit this page periodically to review any such changes and to (b) maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user. By accessing and continuing to use the Services after we post notice of any changes, you signify your consent and agreement to the updated Privacy Policy.  
</p>

<h2>2. Types of Information Collected </h2>
<p>
In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect information from our users.  
</p>
<p>
We collect Personally Identifiable Information, which is information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on the Services, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. Providing information is purely optional on your part; however, not all features and services (such as, responding to your inquiries) would be available to you if you elect not to provide information. The information we may request include your name, address, e-mail address and other information. When ordering our Services, you may be asked to provide a credit card number or other payment information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 
</p>
<p>
We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you use the Services in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. 
</p>

<h2>3. Collection Methods and Use of Information </h2>
<p>
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you (a) register for the Services and give us your e-mail address with us; (b) sign up for special offers from selected third parties; (c) send e-mail messages, submit forms, or transmit other information by telephone or letter; (d) interact with our Services and advertisements; (e) transact with us, such as, when you make purchases, submit payment information, respond to any offers, or download applications from us; and (f) provide us with information when you contact us for help. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may also collect, or our third-party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services, and to gather demographic information. Our third-party ad servers will also provide us reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon on our Services in a manner that does not identify personally any individual. 
</p>
<p>
We may use third-party analytics service to collect, monitor and analyze the information collected as described above.
</p>
<p>
We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, fulfill any transactions, enhance the operation of our Services, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze use of the Services, improve our product and service offerings, provide you with updates about our products and services, provide support, send you notices about our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, enforce our terms, and to provide offers from our affiliates and from third parties that may be of interest to you.   
</p>
<h2>4. Release of Information </h2>
<p>
We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We do provide some of the Services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners, and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our Services and to deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased from us; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service. 
</p>
<p>
If such service providers have access to Personally Identifiable Information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p>
Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. 
</p>
<p>
We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related Services information to third-party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. 
</p>
