                    <b class="color_gray02">● Monitoring/Public Information</b><br>
                    When any game is updated or "patched," our patch routine may check your computer
                    to see that you have the most recent version of game-specific files; when you communicate
                    within any game or any other communication feature within the game (e.g., live chat,
                    instant message services and the like), even "privately" to another person, you
                    do so with the understanding that those communications go through our servers, can
                    be monitored by us, you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications
                    and, accordingly, you expressly consent to monitoring of communications that you
                    send and receive.<br>
                    <br>
                    You may also choose to disclose personal information in our online chat rooms, blogs,
                    bulletin boards, and other public forums made available through the Website. Personal
                    information you disclose in such public forums is public information, and there
                    is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Please refer to the Terms of Service
                    for additional information relating to the disclosure of personal information on
                    public forums.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Use of Personal Information</b><br>
                    Unless otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy, or under the Users Agreement,
                    we will not disclose any personal information collected from customers, prospective
                    customers, or visitors.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Use by PlayOMG</b><br>
                    We use the information you provide so that we may better understand the needs of
                    our customers, prospective customers, and visitors. Specifically, we use your personal
                    information for many purposes, including:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>to allow you to register to use our products and services; </li>
                        <li>to ensure the continued smooth operation of our service; </li>
                        <li>to communicate with you concerning your account or to send you newsletters, surveys,
                            contest announcements, and information about our service or product offerings or
                            the offerings of our business partners; </li>
                        <li>to prevent or investigate actual or suspected fraud, hacking, infringement, or other
                            misconduct involving our products and services, or this Website; </li>
                        <li>to respond to inquiries, troubleshoot problems, investigate incidents, and handle
                            complaints; and </li>
                        <li>to develop to new products and services. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Sharing with Business Partners</b><br>
                    We generally do not sell or trade any personal information about our customers,
                    prospects, or visitors to any third parties. We may share, however, aggregated demographic
                    information with our business partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any
                    personal information that can identify any individual person.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We may also periodically engage in co-marketing activities, where we work with a
                    complementary solution provider to launch a joint marketing program. In these situations,
                    we will only send information to you on behalf of the other; we do not provide your
                    personal information to such partner. We may also enter into business partnerships
                    with other parties to provide specific services. If a user signs up for these services
                    or responds to a particular marketing offer, we may share personal information such
                    as your name or other contact information that is necessary for our business partner
                    to provide these services or get in contact with you.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, in the event PlayOMG combines with another company in the future through
                    a corporate merger, sale, acquisition, liquidation or other similar process, your
                    personal information may be transferred with the business or a part of it, or may
                    be sold as an asset of the business.<br>
                    <br>
                    PlayOMG may also share information with its parent (Macrowell OMG Group) or subsidiaries.
                    In case of legal issues, it may share information by court order, with enforcement
                    agencies, or with consultants or companies it may hire related to the matter. In
                    such cases they will be required to abide by PlayOMG’s privacy rules and keep all
                    information confidential.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Storage of Personal Information and Security</b><br>
                    We take reasonable precaution to protect the personal information we collect from
                    customers, prospective customers, and visitors. When users submit personal information
                    via the Website, the information is housed in a secure in-house database. To prevent
                    unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate
                    use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
                    to safeguard and secure the personal information we maintain. PlayOMG uses industry-standard
                    technology, such as firewalls, in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your
                    personal information. Moreover, we encrypt your transmission of sensitive information
                    to us (e.g., account passwords and payment-related identifiable information) via
                    SSL (secured socket layer) protocol in the interest of heightened privacy protection
                    and information integrity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, only employees who need the information to perform their duties are
                    granted access to personally identifiable information. The unauthorized access or
                    use of such information by an employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for
                    disciplinary action. Additionally, our information management systems are configured
                    in such a way as to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they
                    have no authority to access.<br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, our trusted vendors and business partners are responsible for processing
                    or handling some of the information that we receive. These vendors and business
                    partners are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified
                    by us and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such
                    information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, while we strive to protect your personal information, you should know that
                    information sent over the Internet, whether by e-mail or by using one of our on-line
                    forms, is not necessarily secure against interception. Therefore, we cannot be responsible
                    for such interception and cannot guarantee the security of such information.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Opt-Out Provision </b>
                    <br>
                    When we first collect information from you, we will offer you the opportunity to
                    opt-out of having your personal information shared with parties outside of PlayOMG
                    (unless otherwise described in this Policy). In addition, if you do not want PlayOMG
                    to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt-out
                    at the time of registration or information collection. If, at a later date, you
                    choose to have your name or any other personal information removed from our mailing
                    list, you can do so by going <a href="#" style="color: #09C;">here</a> and filling
                    in the request form.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Review, Update, Correct, or Delete Personal Information</b><br>
                    Generally, you may review, update, correct or delete your personal information collected
                    by the Website. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. Certain types of personal
                    information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as birth date or age, cannot
                    be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the new information.
                    Note that we reserve the right to terminate or delete any registration or promotional
                    entry if we believe the personal information submitted was knowingly false or fraudulent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To review, update, correct or delete your personal information collected by
                    <br>
                    the Website, please go <a href="#" style="color: #09C;">here</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    To have access to your personal information, you must provide proof of identification
                    such as full name, street address, city/state and zip code, user ID and password,
                    and/or information about your recent activity on the Website. We reserve the right
                    to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about your identity.
                    And if the burden or expense of providing access to your personal information is
                    disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others
                    would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. Moreover,
                    we may still retain your information in our files to resolve disputes, enforce the
                    Terms of Service, and for technical and legal requirements and constraints related
                    to the Website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
                    We may disclose personal information when required by law, regulation, court order,
                    or in response to a subpoena or litigation discovery request, or in the good faith
                    belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law
                    or comply with a legal process served on us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● Notification of Changes</b><br>
                    If we decide to change our Policy, we will post those changes on our Policy page
                    so you are aware of what personal information we collect from customers, prospective
                    customers, and visitors to our Website, and when and how such information is collected,
                    used and safeguarded. You are responsible for periodically checking our Website
                    for changes to this Policy. If at any time we decide to use personal information
                    in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will take
                    commercially reasonable measures to obtain e-mail consent from you. You will have
                    a choice as to whether or not we use your personal information in this different
                    manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="color_gray02">● No Guarantees</b><br>
                    While this Policy states our standards for maintenance of personal information and
                    we will make efforts to meet them, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards.
                    There may be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of personal
                    information. As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or representations relating
                    to maintenance or nondisclosure of any personal information collected from customers,
                    prospective customers, or visitors.<br>

                    <b class="color_gray02">● Users Outside Taiwan</b><br>
                    PlayOMG is subsidiary of Macrowell OMG Group, a Taiwan company operating under OMG.
                    OMG's business operations are primarily conducted in Taiwan. We operate our company
                    and administer our policies according to the applicable Taiwan laws and regulations.
                    If you use our service from outside Taiwan, you are thereby consenting for your
                    personal information to be processed in Taiwan in the manner described in this Policy.
                    Furthermore, you acknowledge that the privacy laws of Taiwan may differ from the
                    laws in the country where you are located and may not provide you the same rights
                    or protections as those laws.
