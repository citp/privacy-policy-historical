**Privacy Policy**

Playbill values your interest in the theatre community, both online and offline, and assures you that your privacy is a priority to us. The Playbill web site adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information) and preserving the integrity of this online medium.

Visiting Playbill.com:

When you visit our sites, our web server automatically recognizes only your domain name, IP address, what browser, operating system and screen size you are using. We use this information in aggregate form to analyze how traffic flows at Playbill.com, but no one can contact or identify you from this information. 

Cookies:

Playbill places an industry-standard "cookie" file on your computer to more accurately count the number of visitors and track activity on our websites. This cookie is totally anonymous and does not store any personal information about individual users. Cookies can also be used to store certain visitor preferences, like your favorite media player as well as remaining logged in as a Playbill Club member. In such cases, users have a choice of storing such information in a cookie or typing it each time they visit the site. These cookies are not used to track users.

E-mail Communications:

Playbill regularly sends email Newsletters and membership correspondence to our registered members and visitors with information about performing arts discounts, offers and opportunities as well as Playbill programs, services or membership opportunities. In order to become a Playbill Club member and receive emails from Playbill.com, a user must follow a double opt-in process - after signing up for the list, a confirmation email will be sent to the user's email address. Only after the user positively confirms his/her desire to receive emails will the user begin to receive Playbill Club emails. Note that as of June 2007, subscription to the Playbill Club email list is required to have access to Playbill Club discount offers posted on Playbill.com.

If you do not wish to receive any email from Playbill, you have a number of options: 

  * At the bottom of each Playbill Club email is a link to unsubscribe from Playbill Club emails. Clicking on this link will unsubscribe you from the list. 
  * Email the Playbill Club list manager at [clubmanager@Playbill.com](mailto:clubmanager@playbill.com). 
  * Call the Playbill Club manager 212-557-5757. 

We will do our best to make your change in a timely manner. 

Playbill never sells, exchanges or lends to third parties any email information you provide when subscribing to our E-mail communications. If you enter a contest and are asked to provide personal information such as address and phone number, it will be used only to contact you in case you are a winner. Any other request for personal information will not be used to contact or track you unless explicitly stated at the time the information is requested.

Comments/Bulletin Board Participation:

Playbill reserves the right to collect the e-mail addresses of those who post comments, messages to our bulletin board, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is to ensure compliance with bulletin board rules and occasionally to alert members and visitors to opt-in to our e-mail newsletter but is never shared with other organizations.

Security:

When you purchase a classified ad on Playbil.com, the information you provide is encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer Certificate (SSL) and transferred using secure protocol to Playbill where it is stored in a secure database. The SSL Certificate will provide 128-bit-encryption as long as users are running 128-bit enabled browsers. Playbill has aggressive security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.
