<h2>PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Because our Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13,
ESTsoft Inc. does not provide memberships to persons under age 13. If
you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account on the Site,
you may not sign up for any subscription service or buy anything through
 our online store, and you are not eligible to enter any of our
sweepstakes or promotions.</p>

<p>Except as may be required by law, ESTsoft Inc. will not knowingly
collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children
under the age of 13.</p>

<h3>A. CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 13 AND 18</h3>

<p>If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please let your parent or
guardian know about this Privacy Policy and get his or her permission
before you give us any of your personal identifiable information, before
 you use any of our message board, in-game chat message or social chat
features, before you sign up for any online cash shop game services, and
 before you buy anything from our online store.</p>

<p>Don't post your real name on a web site, forum or message board, and
never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family,
 including your phone number and/or address. Use screen names and not
real names at all times.</p>

<p>If you win a sweepstakes that has a prize, your parent or guardian
will have to mail or fax us a signed note at the address or fax number
listed in the rules for the specific contest that says it was OK for you
 to enter, and tells us they will accept the prize for you.</p>

<p>Some areas of the Site may have special rules for children under the
age of 18. When you are in those areas, you must follow those rules.</p>

<h3>B. INFORMATION FOR PARENTS/GUARDIANS</h3>

<p>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child
has submitted his or her personal information without your permission or
 consent, ESTsoft Inc. will take reasonable steps to remove that
information from the ESTsoft Inc. database at your request. Please
contact us immediately at support@playthisgame.com</p>

<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>
<h3>A. GENERAL</h3>
<p>Personal Information is information that directly or indirectly
identifies a particular individual, such as your name (first and surname
 together), email address, postal address and/or phone number; visitors
purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional
information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date and
shipping and billing addresses (collectively, "Personal Information").
ESTsoft Inc. only collects personal information on a voluntary basis.
(e.g. through interaction or registration with the Site).</p>
<p>If you decide to provide us your Personal Information, it will
generally take the form of either: (1) account or product registration,
or registration for online game participation, (2) the purchase of goods
 or services through our online store (including the purchase of in-game
 digital items ("Cash Shop Items")), (3) message boards or forums, (4)
newsletters, (5) e-cards or Find-a-Friend emails, (6) contest
registrations, (7) customer service or technical support, (8) consumer
complaint(s), and (9) surveys. We will only collect the Personal
Information which is needed to fulfill your requests and/or our
legitimate business objectives, as set out in this Privacy Policy, and
we will keep it no longer than is necessary to fulfill such purposes and
 objectives. If you refuse to divulge your Personal Information when
requested, and the disclosure of such Personal Information is indicated
as being required (rather than voluntary), you may not be able to access
 certain functionality or areas of the Site (such as chat rooms and
message boards).</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>B. EMAIL NEWSLETTERS AND FRIEND TO FRIEND PROMOTIONS</h3>
<p>Typically you need to have an Account in order to receive emails from
 us, provided that you may receive email communications from us on a
one-time basis if you have contacted us directly with regard to a
specific request or for email newsletters. You can opt-out of receiving
future marketing emails from us by following the directions contained in
 the email to "unsubscribe." Also, except in jurisdictions where it may
be prohibited by law to do so, the Site or service offerings available
thereon may allow you to submit information about other people. For
example, we may offer "Send to a Friend" promotions, like electronic
postcards available on the Site or through our newsletters. In these
situations, you may provide the email address and, sometimes, the name
of a friend. After the "Send to a Friend" transaction is completed, that
 information is deleted. We will not retain the recipient's email
address for longer than necessary to complete the transmittal. In our
communication to your friend in this circumstance, he or she will also
be presented with an opportunity to "opt-out" from receiving future
emails from us. You might also submit a person's name and other
information if you purchase a gift and want to have it sent directly to
the recipient. A record of that transaction will be maintained as
allowed and/or required by law.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>C. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND ACCESS</h3>
<p>ESTsoft Inc. provides certain content, online games (each a "Game")
and/or services through the Site. Some areas of the Site may allow you
to visit as a guest and remain anonymous, but you may not be able to
access all the content and features of those areas without registering
an account with us (e.g. in order to play our Games or purchase
Game-related Virtual Items), additional information, such as your real
name and billing information, will be required) (an "Account").
Important information regarding Account registration procedures and the
security of your Account is set out in our Terms of Use.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>D. ONLINE PURCHASES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h3>
<p>When you sign up to play one of our fee-based games or you make
certain online purchases from us (including the purchase of any
Game-related Virtual Items), we may also require that you provide us
with the necessary billing information such as your real name, credit
card or payment information, and shipping or billing address, so that we
 may provide the content, Game, Virtual Item(s), service, or product to
you (according to the terms of the sale, including for example our Terms
 of Use and the End User License Agreement ("EULA") for such Game(s)).
In order to resolve issues related to customer service, billing
questions, technical and computer support, etc., we may also require you
 to provide us with some Personal Information so that we may resolve
such issues properly.</p>
<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>E. SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS</h3>
<p>To participate in some of our sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and
other promotions, you may be asked to provide additional Personal
Information such as your mailing address. This information may be
collected by ESTsoft Inc. or by third parties such as co-sponsors or
vendors for the promotion. Potential winners may be required to provide
additional Personal Information for the purpose of verifying eligibility
 and awarding prizes, and for tax purposes. ESTsoft Inc.'s use of any
such information will be governed by this Privacy Policy. The names of
third parties such as co-sponsors (other than vendors hired by us to
conduct, administer, and execute a promotion on behalf of ESTsoft Inc.)
will be disclosed to you when you are asked to sign up for the
promotion. You should review such third parties' privacy policies to see
 how they may use any information that they collect.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>F. SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION</h3>
<p>When you engage with our content on or through third party social
networking websites, such as Facebook and/or Twitter (or third party
social media plug-ins and applications), you may allow us to have access
 to certain information from the applicable social media profile, such
as your name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your
list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or
the "likes" you make). By doing so, you consent to the use of this
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When you provide
personal information to us in this manner, it may be publicly viewed by
other members of the applicable social media websites and we cannot
prevent further use of the information by third parties.</p>
<p>Through some social networking websites' privacy settings, you can
control the data you share. For more information about how social
networking websites handle your personal information, please refer to
their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>

<h3>G. ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS, GAMES</h3>
<p>When you play any of the Games offered and/or served by ESTsoft Inc.,
 or use any of the communication features on the Site, your internet
protocol address (the unique number assigned to your server or internet
service provider)(your "IP Address") from which you access any of the
above may be stored in our records. ESTsoft Inc. may track such IP
addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information,
site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being
abused.</p>
<p>When any Game is updated or "patched," our patch routine may check
your computer to see that you have the most recent version of
Game-specific files; when you communicate within any Game or any other
communication feature within the Site (e.g. live chat, instant message
services and the like), even "privately" to another person, you do so
with the understanding that those communications go through our servers,
 you expressly agree to waive any rights of confidentiality that you may
 have in and to your communications (if any) when using any of the
Site's communication features, you agree you have no expectation of
privacy in any of those communications and, accordingly, and where and
to the extent permitted by applicable law, you expressly consent to
monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer
service communications) that you send and receive. When you log in to
one of our Games, your system specifications (such as OS, RAM, video
card, monitor, system configuration, crash data etc.) may be
reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of analyzing and optimizing
your Game experience and in order to provide you with customer service.</p>
<p>Please take note that information you post to the public areas of our
 Site, which includes but is not limited to, message boards, forums,
chat rooms, and/or profiles, if applicable, will be displayed publicly
and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>H. CONSENT TO MONITOR</h3>
<p>Please note that, when running, some Games may monitor your
computer's random access memory ("RAM"), media access control ("MAC")
address, configuration files and system files, etc., for unauthorized
third party programs running concurrently with your Game which, in
ESTsoft Inc. ‘s sole determination: (i) enable or facilitate cheating of
 any type; (ii) allow users to modify or hack the applicable Game
interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly
authorized by ESTsoft Inc.; or (iii) intercept, "mine" or otherwise
collect information from or through the applicable Game (an
"Unauthorized Third Party Program"). In the event that a Game detects an
 Unauthorized Third Party Program, (a) the Game may communicate
information back to ESTsoft Inc., including without limitation your
Account username, details about the Unauthorized Third Party Program
detected and the activities or functions performed thereby, and/or
details about your computer, and/or (b) ESTsoft Inc. may exercise any or
 all of its rights and remedies under this Agreement or the applicable
Game EULA without prior notice to the user linked to such Unauthorized
Third Party Program.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that any and all data that is stored and is resident
on our servers, and any and all communications that you make within the
Site or any Games (including, but not limited to, messages solely
directed at another player or group of players) traverse through our
servers, may or may not be monitored by us or our agents (to the extent
permitted by applicable law), you have no expectation of privacy in any
such communications and expressly consent to such monitoring of
communications you send and receive. You expressly agree to waive any
rights of confidentiality that you may have in and to your
communications (if any) when using any of the Site's communication
features, you agree you have no expectation of privacy in any of those
communications and, accordingly, and you expressly consent to such
monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer
service communications) that you send and receive.</p>

<h3>I. INDIRECT COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Please note that, as mentioned elsewhere in this Privacy Policy
and/or in our&nbsp;Terms of Use&nbsp;and/or on the Site itself, ESTsoft
Inc. may collect from you Personal Information relating to certain third
 parties, such as your parents, other family members, friends, etc.
("Indirect Personal Information"). Except as provided by applicable laws
 and/or as described in this Privacy Policy, you will not give any such
Indirect Personal Information to us and/or any to third-party without
the relevant third party's consent.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>
<a name="5"></a>

<h2>WHAT NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>
<p>General, aggregated, demographic, and non-Personal Information may be
 collected by ESTsoft Inc.. This type of anonymous, aggregated profiling
 and session data may include information that you have provided to us
through surveys, polls, etc., but will not be tied to any Personal
Information (through cookies or other means), without your consent. It
may also include aggregated anonymous information about website usage
and the customer base.</p>
<p>As part of the registration process for some services, you may be
asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. For
example, you may be asked to provide information concerning your date of
 birth, country, entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the
like. This information is generally optional, but where provided it may
be included in your Account profile and you hereby consent to this
information being tied to your Personal Information. ESTsoft Inc.
requests this information to understand you better and to also bring to
your attention new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest
 to you. Where ESTsoft Inc. automatically collects non-Personal
Information as stated above, and it is possible to link this information
 to your Personal Information, you hereby consent to ESTsoft Inc.
linking relevant non-Personal information to your Personal Information.</p>
<p>In many cases, ESTsoft Inc. will automatically collect certain
non-Personal Information about your use of the Site. ESTsoft Inc. might
collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet
 browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of
your Internet service provider, your "click path" through the Site, and
the website or advertisement that was linked to or from the Site when
you visited. To do this, ESTsoft Inc. may use cookies and other
technology (see below). In addition, your web browser or client software
 may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding
your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to ESTsoft
Inc.. ESTsoft Inc. may use this information to generate statistics about
 our user community and may provide such information to advertisers
and/or our affiliates. ESTsoft Inc. may also use such information for
security, system integrity (e.g. the prevention of hacking, cheats,
etc.) or enforcement purposes. Your visits to the Site, and information
provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you
provide us with Personal Information or have provided such information
in the past. For example, if you've created an Account, your Account
information (including email address, and billing and shipping
information) may be linked to the items you purchased at our online
store (i.e., purchase order history).</p>

<h2>INFORMATION ON COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>The Site, and some services and advertisements displayed or made
available thereon, may contain "cookies." Cookies are a feature of your
web browser which allows websites to transfer bits of information to
your computer for recordkeeping purposes. A cookie stored on your
computer can be used to "remember" things such as your password or that
you have already registered an Account. This enables us to accelerate
your future activities, saving the time that you would otherwise spend
entering information such as your registration or password.</p>
<p>ESTsoft Inc. (itself or through a third party service) also employs a
 software technology called clear gifs (also known as "web beacons")
that helps us better manage content on our Site by informing us what
content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored
on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are imbedded invisibly on
Site pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this
sentence. These clear gifs are not tied to Personal Information.
Technology and tools such as clear gifs assist in the delivery of
cookies.</p>
<p>Our third party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track
 non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site in
the aggregate. They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve
our Site. We have no access to or control of these third-party tracking
utilities.</p>
<p>We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which
 e-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the
effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our
marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied
 to Personal Information.</p>
<p>Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer
until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you
close your browser). Certain cookies are required to allow or facilitate
 electronic communications or are necessary to allow the provision of
online services at the request of the user. On their own, cookies or
related technologies do not contain or reveal any Personal Information
but can be combined with and used to process Personal Information.
Personal Information collected through the use of these technologies
will be collected, stored and processed according to this Privacy
Policy.</p>
<p>ESTsoft Inc. (itself or through a third party service) uses cookies,
clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technology to:</p>
<p>enable you to move around the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website;</p>
<p>collect information about how you use our Site, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and improve how our Site works;</p>
<p>store information about your preferences, so as to allow us to customize your experience with the Site and its sub-sites;</p>
<p>to speed up your searches;</p>
<p>recognize you when you return to our site;</p>
<p>retrieve information for promotional, marketing or security purposes; and</p>
<p>collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>By using our Site, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device and/or use clear gifs.</p>
<p>Most internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your
computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning
before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions
 or "Help" screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please
note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Site may
not function properly.</p>

<h2>HOW WE USE AND SHARE THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>
<h3>A. HOW WE USE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>

<p>If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in this way,
or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, you
can "opt-out" in the manner discussed under "Your Privacy Rights" set
forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>B. INFORMATION WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<p>Where and to the extent required by the applicable laws, you hereby
expressly consent to your Personal Information being shared with or
otherwise transferred by ESTsoft Inc. to third parties.</p>
<p>When you have provided Personal Information to us for a particular
purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we
have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request and who we subject
to confidentiality requirements. This may include, but is not limited
to, fulfillment houses, billing services, transaction managers, credit
verification services, and other third party service providers. We may
also disclose any of your Personal Information to law enforcement or
other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal
investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual
property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise
may be required by applicable laws, or, as we deem necessary in our sole
 discretion, in order to protect the rights, property or safety of
ESTsoft Inc., our customers or others. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of
fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>We will also provide your Personal Information to third party
processors so that it can be administered and processed for the purposes
 notified to you in the Privacy Policy and our&nbsp;Terms of
Use&nbsp;and we may also share details with third parties (such as
auditors or legal advisors) in order to obtain professional advice. Any
such processing will be governed by an agreement in the form required by
 applicable laws, preserving any and all of your statutory data
protection rights.</p>
<p>Except as described in this policy, we will not give any of your
Personal Information to any third party without your express approval,
and the only Personal Information we will request to share with third
parties is your name, mailing address and email address. If you do not
want us to share your Personal Information with third parties, you can
"opt out" in the manner discussed under "Your Privacy Rights" set forth
on the first page of this Privacy Policy. We sometimes share general,
demographic, or aggregated non-Personal Information with third parties
about our user base, but that information does not include any Personal
Information.</p>
<p>You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use
by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Site, of any Personal
Information contained in the ESTsoft Inc. database for such site, if
ESTsoft Inc. or one of its companies assigns all of its rights and
obligations regarding the use of your Personal Information at the time
of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all
of the Site's assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar
event.</p>

<h3>C. INFORMATION ABOUT LINKS AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THE SITE</h3>
<p>You have the right to access information held about you by ESTsoft
Inc.. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with
applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected online by
ESTsoft Inc. through the site, as maintained by ESTsoft Inc. and
affiliated companies that ESTsoft Inc. may own or control. From time to
time, we may provide links to third party websites. This Privacy Policy
does not apply to third party websites, whether we provide a link to
such sites or not, so we encourage you to review the policies of all
such sites carefully, as your rights will be governed by those third
party policies and not by ESTsoft Inc.'s. Additionally, there may be
unauthorized third party websites that may be providing links from their
 sites to the Site without our knowledge or control. We are not
responsible for the content of any third party websites, expressly
disclaim any statements or assertions made on such websites, and deny
all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such

<h2>INFORMATION FOR PERSONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>For persons in the European Union ("EU") as used herein, terms such
as "Personal Information" refer to "personal data" as defined by the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and applicable local laws.</p>
<p>If you are a visitor from outside the United States, your personal
data may be transferred to, stored at and processed within the United
States (and/or other non- European Economic Area ("EEA") jurisdictions).
 Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United
States or other countries where the Site operates may not be as
stringent as that under your country of residence. We will not collect any
personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily by providing us
 with your freely given specific and informed consent. By using the
Site, you agree that we may transfer, store and process your personal
data outside the EEA in connection with the purposes stated in this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In certain countries other than the United States, some of our online
 games and the services related thereto may be provided to you by third
party distribution partners. To the extent that a third party
distributor is providing services related to your Account, you
understand and agree that each such distributor will collect and use
your Personal Information in accordance with its own privacy policies
(which you will have access to when you register to play). To the extent
 that ESTsoft Inc. collects or retains any of your Personal Information,
 its use will continue to be governed by the terms of this Privacy
Policy.</p>
<p>For example, in EU countries, to the extent that third party
publishers and distributors ("Third Party Distributors") are performing
services related to your Account, we elect the applicable Third Party
Distributor(s) as ESTsoft Inc.'s representative (as defined in the EU
Data Protection Directive) in each such country with respect to the
online games for which such Third Party Distributor(s) is the
distributor and the related personal data collected for such game. All
such Third Party Distributors must enter into an agreement with ESTsoft
Inc. to maintain such personal data in accordance with their privacy
policy, available on their website.</p>

customers' approval. If, at any time, you wish to opt out of having your
 Personal Information shared with third parties and/or receiving

<h2>HOW SECURE IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>ESTsoft Inc. has made an effort to ensure that all information
collected will remain secure and in its original form (i.e. free from
any alteration). As such, access to all Personal Information is strictly
 controlled. When payment information is transmitted, for example,
ESTsoft Inc. employs an industry standard security technology known as a
 secure-socket-layer ("SSL") encryption. Unless otherwise specified
herein or on the Site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are
 used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing
purposes. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that
third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient
protection of Personal Information.</p>
<p>While ESTsoft Inc. takes reasonable precautions against possible
breaches of the Site and customer databases, no website or Internet
transmission is completely secure. Consequently, ESTsoft Inc. cannot and
 does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or
other breaches will never occur, but we have in place reasonable
technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal
Information against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss,
destruction, or against unauthorized disclosure or access to the
information we collect online. ESTsoft Inc. urges you to take steps to
keep your Personal Information safe by memorizing your password or
keeping it in a safe place (separate from your Account information),
logging out of your user Account, and closing your web browser.</p>
