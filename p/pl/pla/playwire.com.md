## **Playwire Media’s Privacy Policy**

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Playwire Media LLC, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Playwire Media”) uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to this World Wide Web site and any other websites owned or operated by Playwire Media or that may be subsequently added, variations or successors to this website ([www.PlaywireMedia.com](http://www.playwiremedia.com/ "www.PlaywireMedia.com"), the “Playwire Media Sites”), any Playwire Media computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the Playwire Media Sites (“Playwire Media Software”) and any Playwire Media services purchased or otherwise made available from the Playwire Media Sites (“Playwire Media Services”) (collectively, the “Playwire Media Properties”). This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all Users (“Users”) of the Playwire Media Properties.

A. WHAT INFORMATION PLAYWIRE MEDIA COLLECTS FROM YOU

Playwire Media may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.

**1\. “Personal Information.”** Personal Information refers to information that lets Playwire Media know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). Playwire Media may collect Personal Information when you use the Intergi Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with Intergi, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.

**2\. “Non-Personal Information.”** Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations). Playwire Media may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.

B. HOW PLAYWIRE MEDIA COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION

The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all of Playwire Media’s customers worldwide.

**1\. Registration.** Prior to using one or more of the Playwire Media Properties, Playwire Media may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account (“Account”) or to enable features or functionality of the Playwire Media Properties. Failure to provide all required information required by Playwire Media may prevent access to any or all Playwire Media Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Playwire Media Properties.

**2\. Information Collected Through Technology.** While you are able to visit the Playwire Media Sites and remain anonymous, Playwire Media or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Playwire Media Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:

**(a) Cookies.** Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Playwire Media Sites. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Playwire Media Properties unavailable to you. Playwire Media respects the user’s wish for anonymity and avoiding cookies.

Each time you access the Playwire Media Sites and each time you request one of Playwire Media’s pages, the server logs your IP address.

**(c) Web Beacons.** Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. Playwire Media may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Playwire Media sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.

**(d) Tracking Content Usage.** If you use the Playwire Media Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, “Content”) to your website or to a third party website, Playwire Media tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User accounts and the use of Content.
