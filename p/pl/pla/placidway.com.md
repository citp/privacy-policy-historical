**2\. General Information**

PlacidWay provides information regarding medical tourism. Much of our information is published on our website, however, we do also offer our "Request for Information" service.  When you complete our online Request for Information form, the information that you provide helps us provide detailed information regarding the location of clinics in the nations you are interested in that possess health care providers who are able to provide the treatment you seek.  We will share this information with the clinics and healthcare providers so that we can provide you with clinic and healthcare contact names and phone numbers and so that you can conduct your own research to determine if the clinics and healthcare professionals meet your expectations. 

At your request, in order to facilitate a review of your medical records by the clinic or healthcare profession of your choice, we will forward your medical records either electronically or by fax.  After receiving your medical records and reviewing the same, the clinic or health care provider you have selected will be able to better advise you regarding your medical treatment options, related costs, post-surgery recovery time and the amount of time in total you will need to stay in the nation where the clinic is located.

We do not share your medical information, name, email address or any other personally identifiable information with any third parties except as we have explained in the above paragraph.

Should you use our “forward to friend” service, we may store related file details in our database.  We may send emails to those parties so that we can encourage them to sign up for our services. We also will store information regarding such “friend” emails so that we can determine which of our members are more successful regarding recruiting new members to our web site in case we wish to reward or provide some sort of positive feedback to such members.

You can access our Website home page without disclosing your personal data. Some aspects of our site are available to registered members only and as our terms require, you must provide us with the required registration information, which has to be complete, accurate and up to date.

It is our policy not to send unsolicited emails or allow third parties to contact you via the email address that you provide to us.  We do have a health related email service that you may subscribe to if you wish.  If you do subscribe to our email, we will stop sending it to you if you decide to opt-out by following the opt-out instructions.

**3.   Acquisition of our Company and other Transactions.**

 Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. We may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on our web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Possible exceptions to our policy include the following circumstances, and as indicated herein:

If a governmental agency, or an attorney, subpoenas your private information, or makes a formal request for discovery pursuant to any legal action, or pending legal action, should we possess that information, then we would share whatever personally identifying information we possess with the seeking party. Generally speaking, it is unlikely that we would possess that information except as explained herein.

If our attorney requests personally identifying information relevant to a current or pending legal matter in which you are a potential or actual party or otherwise contributed in some way to the causation of the legal matter then we will share whatever personally identifying information that we may have with our attorney.
