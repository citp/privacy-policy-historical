<p>In addition to the information that we collect from you directly, we may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, business partners, our affiliates, or publicly available sources.  For example, if you submit a job application, or become an employee or contractor, we may conduct a background check.</p>

<h2 id="use_and_process_of_information"><strong><u>Use And Processing Of Information</u></strong></h2>

<p>In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we use information in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
  <li>To identify you when you visit our websites or our games. </li>
  <li>To provide products and services.</li>
  <li>To improve our services and offerings.</li>
  <li>To streamline processes.</li>
  <li>To conduct analytics.</li>
  <li>To respond to inquiries related to support, employment opportunities, or other requests.  </li>
  <li>To send marketing and promotional materials, including information relating to our products, services, sales, or promotions.</li>
  <li>For internal administrative purposes, as well as to manage our relationships.</li>              
</ul>

<p>Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose.  For example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any issues with your order.  As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.</p>

<h2 id="sharing_of_info"><strong><u>Sharing Of Information</u></strong></h2>

<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we disclose information in the following situations:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Affiliates and Acquisitions</strong>.

If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, we will also share information with that company.  </li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Other Disclosures with Your Consent</strong>.  We may ask if you would like us to share your information with other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this policy.</li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Other Disclosures without Your Consent</strong>. We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws.  We may also share your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the provision of services by a third party intermediary.</li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Public</strong>.  Some of our websites may provide the opportunity to post in a public forum.  If you decide to submit information on these forums, that information may be publically available. </li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Partner Promotion</strong>. We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third party partners.  If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third party partner the information that you provide will be shared with us and with them.  Their use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. </li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may share your information with service providers.

If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you service related communications. </li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Changes To Your Personal Information</strong>. We rely on you to update and correct your personal information.    Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.  If our website or game does not permit you to update or correct certain information contact us using the contact information below.</li>
  <li style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Deletion Of Your Personal Information</strong>.

<h2 id="how_we_protect"><strong><u>How We Protect Personal Information</u></strong></h2>

<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>

<p>Some of our websites permit you to create an account.  When you do you will be prompted to create a password.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you.  You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous"><strong><u>Miscellaneous</u></strong></h2>

<p>The following additional information relates to our privacy practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transmission of Information To Other Countries</strong>. Your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country.  Nonetheless, where possible we take steps to treat personal information using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information.  By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States.  If you would like more information concerning our attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information below.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Applications/Websites</strong>.  We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. </li>
  <li><strong>Changes To This Privacy Policy</strong>.  We may change our privacy policy and practices over time.  To the extent that our policy changes in a material way, the policy that was in place at the time that you submitted personal information to us will generally govern that information unless we receive your consent to the new privacy policy.   </li>    
</ul>

<h2 id="contact_info"><strong><u>Contact Information</u></strong></h2>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or complaints concerning our privacy practices please contact us at the appropriate address below.  We will attempt to respond to your requests and to provide you with additional privacy-related information. </p>
