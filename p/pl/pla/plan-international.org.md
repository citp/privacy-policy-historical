### Consent

Plan Ltd is committed to ensuring the privacy of all our users. This Privacy Policy governs all pages on the domain plan-international.org. It does not apply to pages hosted by other organisations, including the websites of Plan fundraising offices or third party sites. The Plan Ltd Website (the “Website”) may be linked to the websites of such other parties, but those other sites may have their own privacy policies which apply to them.

By using the Website, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Plan Ltd may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time and, if such changes are made, we may place notices on the Website so that you can be aware of them. Your continued use of the Website will be on the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.

### What types of information do we collect and store?

The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Website. You can access most of the pages on the Website without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. Our web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the Website. This information may be used to create aggregate statistics about how the Website is used.

We do not collect personal information (such as your name, e-mail address or country of residence) on the Website unless you choose to provide it. For example, where you express an interest in subscribing to our email updates.

### How do we use information collected?

Your personal information will be retained by Plan Ltd and its service providers in a secure environment, will be kept confidential, and will only be used in connection with the purposes for which it is submitted, or as otherwise explained on the Website or as necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations.

### Sharing of your personal information

The information you provide will not be sold or rented. If we have your permission, we may share your personal information with Plan fundraising offices. They may contact you inter alia to invite you to support their activities or to subscribe to their newsletters. (Plan's fundraising offices are listed at: [plan-international.org/fundraising](http://plan-international.org/where-we-work/fundraising-countries "Fundraising countries")) Otherwise, we shall only share your personal information if we are required to disclose it by law.

The disclosure of your personal information discussed above may involve transfer of that information outside of the UK and European Union. Countries outside the European Union, such as the United States, may not have data privacy laws as strong as those in force in the European Union.
