### Our privacy policy

Plan Ltd is committed to ensuring the privacy of all our users. This Privacy Policy governs all pages on the domain plan-international.org. It does not apply to pages hosted by other organisations, including the websites of Plan International fundraising offices or third-party sites. The Plan Ltd Website (the “ **Website** ”) may be linked to the websites of such other parties, but those other sites may have their own privacy policies which apply to them.

Plan Ltd may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time and, if such changes are made, we will notify you of those changes by contacting you if appropriate or publishing the updated Privacy Notice on our website. Your continued use of the Website will be on the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.

### WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND STORE?

The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Website. You can access most of the pages on the Website without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. Our web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the Website. This information may be used to create aggregate statistics about how the Website is used (see our Cookies Notice below for more information about this).

We do not collect personal information (such as your name, e-mail address or country of residence) on the Website unless you choose to provide it. For example, where you express an interest in subscribing to our email updates.

By subscribing to our email updates, you have provided us with your consent to process your personal data and send you marketing information.  

### HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED?

Where you have provided your consent for your personal information to be processed by Plan Ltd and its service providers, it will be done in a secure environment and only used in connection with the purposes for which it is submitted. At Plan Ltd, we process personal data in order to send you email updates about the work we are doing, marketing information or as necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations.

### SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

The information you provide will not be sold. Where necessary, we will share your information with our service providers and where we have your permission, we will share your personal information with Plan International fundraising offices if they request details of subscribers to email updates in their territory. They may contact you inter alia to invite you to support their activities or to subscribe to their newsletters. Otherwise, we shall only share your personal information if we are required to disclose it by law.

If you choose to email us directly using the ‘Contact us’ facility, we have a legitimate interest to process your personal information for the purposes of reply or to forward to the appropriate Plan International office for action. E-mail addresses are not otherwise retained. E-mail addresses are not passed to any third party.

In order to administer the site, we share personal data with third party service providers that perform functions on our behalf, such as a company that hosts our website.  They have access to personal data needed to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes.  In some cases, this may involve processing personal data outside of the UK and European Union.

Furthermore, if you live in a country outside the European Union, the disclosure of your personal information as discussed above may involve the transfer of that information to Plan International fundraising offices outside of the UK and European Union. 

Where your personal information is transferred to a service provider or another Plan International office based outside of the European Union, we will ensure that your data is protected to the same extent as in the European Union through one of the following safeguards:

  * Transfer to a non-EU country whose privacy legislation the ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data as determined by the European Commission; or
  * Put in place a contract with the service provider or fundraising office that means they must protect personal data to the same standards required by the European Union.
