                                       PRIVACY POLICY
General Policy. This policy describes the information that Platt Electric Supply, Inc., an Oregon
corporation ("Platt," "we," "us" or "our") collects about visitors to our website, web application,
or mobile application, (collectively the "Website") or about our customers, prospective
customers and prospective employees, how we use that information and how we protect that
information. It also discusses certain choices you have regarding your personally identifiable
information. By using our Website or otherwise submitting information to Platt, you consent to
the following terms, as they may be amended from time to time.
Information We Collect.
Online: You may visit our Website anonymously. We collect your Internet Protocol address, but
this information generally does not reveal your identity. The data that we regularly collect about
visitors to our Website (e.g., browser type, pages accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not enable
us to identify you. We use "cookies," small files that are sent to your browser and stored on your
hard drive, to identify you as a unique user on our Website. Our use of cookies is explained in
more detail below. We collect personally identifiable information about you only if you
voluntarily provide it to us by requesting information, products or services from us.
Offline: We collect information that you provide us to set up an account or otherwise form a
customer relationship with Platt or to consider you for a job with Platt. Once an account is
opened or customer relationship is formed, we may collect information about your purchasing
and payment history. If you are hired by Platt, we may collect information about your salary and
benefits, qualifications and performance.
Mobile: If you opt to do so, we collect your GPS location from your mobile device to (a) help
you find the nearest branch to your current location; and (b) If you choose to provide a photo for
our mobile application product identifier your photo will be saved with the info from your
current location.
Information You Provide.
Online: When you visit our Website, you may provide personally identifiable information in
order to purchase products or take advantage of services or job opportunities offered through our
Website. For example, you might provide your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and
email address. We collect and store that information. You may always choose not to provide the
information we request. However, you may then be unable to take advantage of the features and
services we offer on our Website.
Offline: When you sign up for an account or otherwise do business with Platt, you may provide
personally identifiable information of yourself, if an individual or sole proprietor, or the
company officers or contact persons, in addition to company information, if a company. We may
use that information to obtain a credit, D&B or similar report or otherwise evaluate your
eligibility for an account. When you apply for a job, you may provide personally identifiable
information, such as name, address, telephone number, email address, birthdate and SSN. We


may use that information to obtain a credit report, do a background or reference check or
otherwise evaluate your suitability for the job.
Information from Other Sources. From time to time we may purchase or otherwise acquire
information about you from other sources and add it to our database, including without limitation
updated delivery and address information.
How We Use Information. If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information,
we will use that information to respond to your inquiry or process your order or application. We
may provide this information to third parties if we believe in our discretion it would be helpful in
responding to you, or if this information is necessary for the third party to do their job (see
"Third Party Service Providers," below). If, in the future, we merge with or are acquired by
another company, or change our structure, we may transfer your personally identifiable
information to the surviving or acquiring entity. We will also disclose your personally
identifiable information if we believe in good faith we are required to do so (a) by law or to
comply with the law or legal process; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the
rights or property of our clients; or (c) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our
employees, clients, visitors or the public.
No Sale of Personally Identifiable Information. Platt will not sell your personally identifiable
information to others except in connection with the sale of Platt or the assets of Platt.
Third Party Service Providers. Platt may from time to time engage others ("Third Party
Providers") to provide online and offline services to Platt, to you, to other clients or to visitors to
our Website. For example, Platt may engage other companies to host, operate and maintain our
Website, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, perform inventories or assessments, and
provide credit information, background checks and other services. Platt will give them access to
your personally identifiable information to the extent necessary to do their jobs. Platt cannot and
does not guarantee that those companies will protect your personally identifiable information.
Links to Other Websites. When you visit our Website, you may be directed to websites of
Third Party Providers and to other websites that are beyond our control ("Third Party Websites").
There are many links to Third Party Websites from our Website that may take you outside our
service. Platt believes that this is one of the strengths of our Website. For example, if you
"click" on a product link or Third Party Provider link, that "click" may take you from our
Website to that Third Party Website. If you choose to visit a Third Party Website, you should
understand that the third party's privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy, will govern your
activities and any information you disclose while visiting that Third Party Website. Third Party
Websites may not have privacy policies or may have privacy policies that are not as protective of
your personally identifiable information as Platt's Privacy Policy. Third Party Websites may
collect data, solicit personally identifiable information, or send cookies to visitors. Platt strongly
recommends that you review and understand the privacy policies of the Third Party Websites
you visit, whether you visit Third Party Websites directly or through a link from a page on our
Website.


Email. From time to time, Platt may send email messages to some or all of its registered users or
customers. Platt may use a bulk email service to distribute that information. If you do not want to
receive such emails, please indicate that preference by contacting us at decline@platt.com.
Online Live Chat/ Mobile Application. Our Website offers you the opportunity to chat online
with a support representative. In order to use this service, you will provide us with, at a
minimum, your name and email address. You may also choose to provide a photo for our mobile
application product identifier. Platt cannot guarantee the security or privacy of this information.
Cookies. Upon your first visit to our Website, our Website may automatically send a "cookie" to
your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal
preferences and user data. Cookies do not identify you by name. Platt uses cookies to store
preferences and user data. You may have your browser disable cookies; however, some Platt
services provided by our Website may not function properly if you disable cookies.
Security. Platt uses encryption software in our Website to safeguard certain of your personally
identifiable information while that information is transmitted over the Internet, including
information you provide upon ordering or purchasing products from our Website. While using
our Website, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
password, and for restricting access to your computer.
Policy Changes. Platt reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post
any revisions to this Privacy Policy on our Website and will provide a paper copy to you upon
your request. Please review the Privacy Policy on our Website www.platt.com or e-mail us at
privacy@platt.com or periodically call us at 503-641-6121 (ask for Credit Dept.) or write us at
10605 SW Allen Blvd, Beaverton, OR. 97005 to request a paper copy of this Privacy Policy so
you can review it for changes. Your use of our Website or any of our offline services will be
subject to our Privacy Policy in effect at that time.
Policy Regarding Children. This Website is for people 18 years of age and older. If you are
under 18 years of age, please do not submit any information to Platt without the consent of a
parent or guardian. Platt does not intentionally collect any information about children.
Disputes Regarding Use of Personally Identifiable Information. Any claim, dispute or
controversy (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, whether statutory, common law or equitable
and whether pre-existing, present or future) against Platt, its agents, employees, affiliates,
successors and assigns, relating to this Privacy Policy will be resolved by binding arbitration
administered by the Arbitration Service of Portland (the "ASP") under its arbitration rules then in
effect or if it is unavailable for any reason, by the American Arbitration Association under its
Commercial Arbitration Rules. You may obtain a copy of the ASP rules by writing to the ASP
at 620 SW 5th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97204 or by sending a request via email to
arbserve@spiritone.com or via telephone at 1-503-226-3109. Any arbitration will be conducted
before a single neutral arbitrator and will be limited solely to the dispute between you and Platt.
The arbitration will be conducted in Portland, Oregon, or by telephone or online, as determined


by the arbitrator. Any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and
may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any claim, dispute or
controversy is not subject to binding arbitration, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for that
claim, dispute or controversy will be the state and federal courts located in Portland, Oregon, that
you will not file any action or proceeding in any other jurisdiction; and that you waive any
argument that Portland, Oregon is an inconvenient forum.
Limitation of Liability. PLATT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR PHYSICAL/EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PLATT'S LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES
EXCEED $100.
Miscellaneous. Platt's policy does not extend to anything that is beyond Platt's reasonable
control, including but not limited to potential insecurities inherent in the operation of the
Internet. Platt uses reasonable precautions to keep your personally identifiable information
secure, whether it was collected online or offline. However, Platt is not responsible for any
breach of security or for the actions of any third parties. If you at any time have questions about
this Privacy Policy, please send your question via email to privacy@platt.com.
