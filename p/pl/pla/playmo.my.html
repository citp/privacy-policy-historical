<div style="padding-left:170px; padding-top:10px; padding-right:40px">
    We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Complete your transaction</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Alleviate any problems that may 	arise in effecting the transaction, </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>To better understand and manage 	our ongoing relationship with you</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>To assure good service</p>
        </li><li>

                <p>For purposes of verification and 	risk management and otherwise with consent or as permitted or 	required by law. </p>
      </li></ul>
  <p>PlayMo may store personally identifiable information on databases for the purposes of the administration of our business, including our ongoing relationship with you, for market research and, only with your consent, for direct marketing purposes. As permitted by applicable law, we may merge personally identifiable information with public information or other information received from reputable vendors to update contact information or to enhance demographic profiles.  </p>
  <p>How We Share Your Personally Identifiable Information<br>
    PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with companies that are affiliated with us that are part of PlayMo. Provided you have given us permission, PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with PlayMo, but would like to send you information about their products and services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with unaffiliated third parties when personally identifiable information is collected. </p>
<p>PlayMo employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information. PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with outside contractors or agents who help manage our information activities (i.e., administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide PlayMo with a specific service and not for any other purpose.  </p>
  <p>PlayMo may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows PlayMo to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on PlayMo's website(s). Your non-personally identifiable information and click stream data about your activities on PlayMo's website(s) may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with PlayMo’s advertisers and business partners. Such information may include:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Visitors’ IP address</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Browser type</p>
        </li><li>
          <p>Date, time and duration of visit</p>
        </li><li>
        <p>Particular pages viewed</p>        
  </li></ul>
  <p>These third parties are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us. </p>
  <p>We may also disclose your personally identifiable information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>As required by law such as to 	comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>When we believe in good faith that 	disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety 	or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a written 	government request </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>For the purposes of processing 	requested transactions or to perform business support functions on 	our behalf</p>
    </li><li>
      <p>If PlayMo becomes involved in a 	merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its 	assets, we will provide notice before personally identifiable 	information becomes subject to a different privacy statement </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>To any other third party with your 	prior consent to do so </p>    
  </li></ul>
  <p>We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Statement. We do not otherwise sell, rent, trade or share your personal identifiable information to third parties for their promotional purposes.<br>
