<h3><strong>Privacy  Policy<br>
</strong></h3>
<p>Albertson’s  LLC respects your privacy and is committed to safeguarding your personally  identifiable information or “personal information” from unauthorized use or  disclosure. This policy describes how your personal information may be  collected when you visit our website, shop at our stores, use our products or  access our services, or otherwise interact with us. It also describes how your  personal information is used or disclosed and the steps we take to protect it  from unauthorized use or disclosure. For special offers, promotions, contests  or specific services, such as those provided by our pharmacies, we might advise  you that additional or different personal information practices or terms exist.  You should refer to those terms or practices as well.</p>
<h3><strong>CONSENT  TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h3>
<p>By  accessing our website or obtain information or services or providing personal  information to us through other means, you are agreeing to the terms of this  Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3><strong>DEFINITION  OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p>We define  the term “personal information” to mean any information that we directly  associate with or use to identify a specific person. This may include an  address, phone number, email address, fax number, online registration or  financial account, when associated with a person’s name. Our definition does  not include "aggregate personal information,” which is information that we  collect about a group or category of persons or services, or “de-identified  information,” which is information from which we or our agents have removed any  information that can be used to specifically identify a person, and this policy  does not restrict or limit our collection or use of those types of information.</p>
<h3><strong>COLLECTION  OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p>We may  collect your personal information through one or more of the following methods.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Information You Provide.</strong> We may request or  give you the opportunity to provide personal information when you register as a  user of our website, shop in our stores, sign up for or use our products or  services, cash a check, contact us about a prior purchase, or email, call, or  otherwise communicate with us. For example, if you enter an on-line  sweepstakes, we may request that you provide your telephone number. If you do  not provide such information, your participation in such program may be  limited. Similarly, if you contact us regarding a product or service that you  are interested in or concerned about, we may request that you provide personal  information that will enable us to respond to your inquiry.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatically Collected Personal Information.</strong> When you shop at our  stores, or register for or use our services, transactional information such as  the date of your purchase, registration or service usage, their descriptions  and if applicable, the dollar amount or value of the transaction may be  collected automatically. We treat this information as personal information if  we combine it with or link it to other information that may identify you.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Information.</strong> We may obtain information about you from  third parties such as demographic marketing information, address verification,  or mailing list information and combine it with other personal information  pertaining to you.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies.</strong> We may use cookies,  web beacons and similar technologies to manage our website and email messages,  and we may collect information about your activities online at our website. We  may link this information with other personal information about you. We may  also allow third parties to serve ads on our websites, and if you visit their  websites, they may collect information about your visit. This Privacy Policy  does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of third  parties that collect your personal information. We encourage you to check the  privacy policies of such third parties to learn about their practices with  respect to the collection, use, disclosure and protection of your personal  information.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>OUR  USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p>We may  use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including but not  limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Responding  to your requests</li>
  <li>Processing  and completing your transactions, including the delivery of products or  services</li>
  <li>Contacting  you about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or  sharing with you special offers from other companies</li>
  <li>Conducting  market research, surveys and similar inquiries to help us understand trends and  customer needs across product categories or customer groups</li>
  <li>Evaluating  your shopping experience or existing products and services, or to create new  items</li>
  <li>Attempting  to contact you regarding product safety or recall issues</li>
  <li>Entering  you into sweepstakes and promotions</li>
  <li>Verifying  and validating your identity</li>
  <li>Keeping  a record of our interactions with you if you place an order or otherwise deal  with our representatives over the telephone or online</li>
  <li>Preventing,  investigating or providing notice of fraud, unlawful or criminal activity, or  unauthorized access to or use of personal information, our website or data  systems; or to meet legal obligations<br>
  </li><br>

</ul>
<h3><strong>DISCLOSURE  OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p>We do not  sell or rent your personal information to third parties in the ordinary course  of our business, nor do we share it with them for their own direct marketing  purposes. Notwithstanding, upon the occurrence of certain corporate  transactions, your personal information may be disclosed or transferred as  described under the caption “Certain Business Transfers” below. We may also  share your personal information with our parent corporation or affiliated  companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described above  under the caption “Our Use of Personal Information.” Our practices with respect  to the disclosure of personal information are described below.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>With Your Consent.</strong> We may disclose your personal information to  third parties with your consent. You may give your consent in several ways,  such as through a written agreement that you sign or acknowledge; an online  method, such as a "clickthrough" agreement or registration page; an  oral statement, such as by way of an interactive voice response; or through the  terms and conditions under which we provide you a particular product or  service. Sometimes your consent may be implicit. For example, if you purchase  products with a credit card and have them shipped to your home, you implicitly  consent to the disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping  company to complete the delivery, and of your credit card number to the credit  card processor to authorize the transaction and to the bank to collect payment.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may disclose your personal information to  third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or  for your benefit. Information provided to such parties for payment  authorization or verification purposes may be retained by them in a database  that is used to provide similar services to others. We may also utilize the  services of third parties to verify customer data, such as mailing addresses or  to supplement other information we have collected. We may also contract with  third parties to host a site, conduct market research, or send you information  regarding our products or services, or those of other companies with whom we  conduct business.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Process.</strong> We may disclose your personal information to  legal or government regulatory authorities in response to their requests for  such information or to assist in investigations of theft, fraud or abuse. We  may also disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with  claims, disputes or litigation, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary  in an emergency.</li>
  <li><strong>Certain Business Transfers.</strong> Your personal  information may be disclosed as part of a corporate business transaction, such  as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of company  assets, and could be transferred to a third party as one of the business assets  in such a transaction. It may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency,  bankruptcy or receivership.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3><strong>HEALTH  INFORMATION/PHARMACIES</strong></h3>
<p>Our  pharmacies collect protected health information, which includes your medical  and personal history, prescription profile for fulfillment of pharmacy orders,  and other health-related information that you, your doctor or your insurance  carrier provides to us. This information is most often used to process your prescriptions,  provide you with health care information or services, or to contact you with  questions and respond to your inquiries. This information is subject to our  notice of privacy practices that more specifically describes how we may use or  disclose your protected health information. You may request a copy of our  notice of privacy practices when you visit any of our pharmacies or by  contacting us using one of the methods listed under the caption "How to  Contact Us" that appears below.</p>
<h3><strong>INFORMATION  PERTAINING TO CHILDREN</strong></h3>
<p>We do not  intend to or knowingly collect personal information online from children under  the age of 13, and we encourage parents or guardians to participate in and  monitor their children's online activity. If a child under 13 has provided personal  information, a parent or guardian may inform us of that fact by contacting us  using one of the methods listed under the caption "How to Contact Us"  that appears below, and we will then delete the information from our database.  If you are under the age of 13, do not provide us with any personal information  either directly, on any website bulletin boards or by other means.</p>
<h3><strong>ACCESS  TO AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p>We do not  maintain all of your personal information in a form that you can access or  update, and some items, such as transaction records, may not be changed.  Accordingly, we will determine and may limit what may be accessed and how, and  we may keep a record of changes (including deletions) and disclose them for  lawful purposes. We keep your personal information for as long as we think is  necessary or advisable, and we reserve the right to retain it to the full  extent not prohibited by law. You may review your personal information that is  readily accessible or request that it be updated by contacting our Customer  Interaction Center using one of the methods listed under the caption "How  to Contact Us" that appears below.</p>
<h3><strong>SECURITY  OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p>We take  various physical, electronic and procedural measures to protect your personal information  from unauthorized disclosure or misuse. We employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  technology, a commonly employed method of encrypted communication used on the  Internet, to encrypt during transmission, sensitive personal information you  input, including credit card numbers. However, because no data security systems  are completely secure, we do not warrant that any personal information that you  provide to us will be secure or safe from unauthorized access. If you provide  any personal information to us, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h3><strong>LINKS  TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong></h3>
<p>Our  website may contain links to websites operated by third parties. When you visit  their websites, they may collect information about your visit and use it to  provide advertisements to you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we  are not responsible for, the practices of third parties that collect your  personal information. Each of these linked websites may maintain its own  policies about the collection, use and protection of your personal information.  We encourage you to check the privacy policies of such third parties to learn  about their practices.</p>
<h3><strong>CHANGES  TO THIS POLICY</strong></h3>
<p>We will  modify this Privacy Policy if our practices change. We will notify you of such  changes by posting the modified version on our website and indicating the date  it was last modified. We encourage you to visit our website periodically to  view the latest version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3><strong>OPT-OUT  CHOICES</strong></h3>
