  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Plazes Service at <a href="http://plazes.com/">http://plazes.com/</a></li>
    <li>This privacy policy covers how Plazes treats personal information that Plazes collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.</li>
    <li>Children under 18 are not permitted to use the Plazes service, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information Collection and How it is used</h2>

  <h3>General Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Plazes collects personal information when you register with Plazes to use Plazes services or to post content on Plazes.</li>
    <li>When you register we ask you only for your E-Mail address and a nickname (pseudonym).</li>
    <li>You can optionally enter information such as your name, address, birth date, gender, icq/aim/msn user names and links to blogs and other communities.</li>
    <li>Plazes automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser and the Plazes Launcher, including your IP address, ambiant technical data (your default gateway's MAC ID, GSM/3G cellId, Wifi access points MAC ID, GPS coordinates etc.), cookie, and the page you request.</li>
    <li>Plazes uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
  <p>IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our log files.</p>
  <p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>
    <li>To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.</li>
    <li>To estimate the total number of users visiting Plazes from specific geographical regions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ambient Data</h3>
  <p>The Plazer Software (the "Plazer") may use available ambient data as the default gateway's MAC ID in your LAN ("Mac ID"), identification of GSM/3G cell towers ('Cell ID'), MAC IDs of Wifi access points ("AP MAC ID") and GPS coordinates of attached GPS receivers ("GPS") to guess your location.
  Plazes <strong class="important">does not track your location unless you explicitly choose to do so</strong> by voluntary check-in to a specific location. Ambient data is used by Plazes to provide preselection of relevant locations to simplify the check-in process.</p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
  Plazes uses two types of cookies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a 'session' cookie that persist one browser session.</li>
    <li>a cookie for auto log-ons that is used when you check "remember me" on login</li>
  </ul>
  <p>About the use of cookies on Plazes.com:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</li>
    <li>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Plazes products or services that require you to "log in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Plazes service.</li>
    <li>Plazes uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:
      <ul>
        <li>Access your information when you "log in".</li>
        <li>Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Plazes.</li>
        <li>Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.</li>
        <li>Conduct research to improve Plazes's content and services.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plazes lets other companies (such as Google) that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Plazes cookies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When you post a comment, or a Plaze description, your Plazes ID or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users.</li>
    <li>If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</li>
    <li>Plazes may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Plazes Terms of Service.</li>
    <li>Plazes may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% of users who regularly user Plazes are between 18 and 24" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial)</li>
    <li>Plazes does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested or when we have your permission.</li>
    <li>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Plazes's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
    <li>We will transfer information about you if Plazes is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Plazes will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Plazes web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    <li>Plazes displays targeted advertisements based on personal information that is exhibited in people's profiles.</li>
  </ul>
