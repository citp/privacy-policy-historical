Platform.sh provides tools to make your development workflow more productive such as our CLI (command line interface).

Information collected may contain the type of actions performed, log data of API activity as well as configuration information. This information may be linked to you and we may use this information to better provide technical support you and to improve our Services.

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Platform.sh’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.

Under the PIPEDA principles, individuals have the right to know why their personal information is being collected, how their personal information will be used, and to whom their personal information will be disclosed, and to have the ability to ask for access to, or correction of, their personal information. More details on the PIPEDA principles can be found on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s [site](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en).

  * **Accuracy and Individual Access.** Your personal information we collect may be deleted, updated and/or completed in your account settings at any time, or you may contact us for assistance with making sure your information is accurate and up-to-date. Most changes will be reflected in your account immediately.
