Each time you use a Green Man Gaming app or sign in to your Green Man Gaming account on your devices (such as a mobile or PC), we may automatically access and store information about your use of that device and app. 

The data that we access from and store on your devices may include:

  1. Device identifiers such as your laptop/desktop ID, mobile device IDs, cookie IDs

  2. Network identifiers such as your IP and MAC address

  3. Account authentication tokens that avoid you having to log in repeatedly

If you make your profile private, then only you will see your achievements, game play time and other interesting data on your gaming profile.  

Data from all the users who linked their Steam accounts is collected and displayed as aggregated community stats.  

Steam can be used online or offline and it updates your profile as soon as you go online. It takes us up to 24-hours to receive your data from Steam so don’t be surprised if you don’t see your new game achievement straight away displayed on your profile.

We may personalise the services we provide to you based on the combined data we have collected about you (for instance, we may use your IP address to display content relevant for your area or we may recommend or to help you discover new games or social media that you are entitled to play and watch using information about your past activity).

We will aim to process your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, within 2 working days. Note that we will still send you important emails about your account even if you opt-out of marketing emails.

If you choose not to allow us to store and access cookies that are not strictly necessary for the provision of our websites, this will also limit when we can recognise your visits to our websites and target and personalise the advertising and commercial purchase recommendations displayed on those websites. Please see the Green Man Gaming [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy/) for more details on our use of cookies and how to control them when accessing our websites.
