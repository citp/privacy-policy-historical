These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit the site to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide will be used.

How We Share Your Personally Identifiable Information  
PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with companies that are affiliated with us that are part of PlayMo. Provided you have given us permission, PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with PlayMo, but would like to send you information about their products and services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with unaffiliated third parties when personally identifiable information is collected. 

PlayMo employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information. PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with outside contractors or agents who help manage our information activities (i.e., administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide PlayMo with a specific service and not for any other purpose. 

PlayMo may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows PlayMo to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on PlayMo's website(s). Your non-personally identifiable information and click stream data about your activities on PlayMo's website(s) may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with PlayMo’s advertisers and business partners. Such information may include: 

  * Visitors’ IP address

  * Browser type

  * Date, time and duration of visit

  * Particular pages viewed




These third parties are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information:

  * As required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process 

  * When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a written government request 

  * For the purposes of processing requested transactions or to perform business support functions on our behalf

  * If PlayMo becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personally identifiable information becomes subject to a different privacy statement 

  * To any other third party with your prior consent to do so 




We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Statement. We do not otherwise sell, rent, trade or share your personal identifiable information to third parties for their promotional purposes.
