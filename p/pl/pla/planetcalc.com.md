# Privacy Policy

At planetcalc.com, we recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we collect when you visit planetcalc.com, and how we safeguard your information.

### Personal information

We collect and store information you enter in the site registration form, such as your name, email and password. Also you may enter your web site URL and a short text about yourself in the personal profile. 

We may send you email comments, notifications or information letters regarding news about our site. 

### Log Files

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited on our site.

We create visitor statistics reports based on information obtained from the log files. The statistics reports consist of aggregate information which does not contain any personal visitor data. These reports may be presented to third parties, for example to advertisers willing to place ads on our site.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences, when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a site interface in a selected language, or the ability to log in to some of our features, such as forums or private site areas.

We also use third party advertisements on planetcalc.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information, including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site and, in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. 

This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). A cookie uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security number, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on our site, as well as all other sites using this advertising technology, by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site, as well as other websites. This could include the inability to log in to services or programs, such as forums or accounts.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have disallowed cookies in your settings, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
