Tilted Mill Entertainment, Inc. (the "Company") collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on this website.

Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you on-line or off-line and can include, but may not be limited to, your first and last name, home or any other physical addresses, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information. In addition we may collect demographic information such as gender, zip code, information about your computer, hardware, software, media, Internet IP addresses and connection, information about on-line activity such as feature usage, game play statistics and scores, user rankings  and click paths and other data that you may provide in surveys or on-line profiles for example.  We use this information: (1) to administer your account; (2) to provide information of interest to you; (3) to communicate with you in connection with contests; (4) for customer support or technical service requests; (5) for player match ups or other on-line services; (6) for registration for site membership; (7) for registration for game-specific event participation; (8) when you order products or subscriptions on-line; and (9) when you request service from third party service providers on our site.   
<br><br>
Usage Data<br>
When you play our games on your system, we may retrieve information about your hardware system and how your game is used, including your Internet Protocol Address.  We use this information to enable you to play our games over the internet.  We also use this information to better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, so that we can improve our products and services.  Participation in online game events is conditional upon you agreeing to us collecting, using, storing, transmitting and publicly displaying statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) generated through your participation.
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, to troubleshoot technical problems and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  In the event of user abuse of our sites, however, we may block certain IP addresses.  IP addresses may be used to personally identify you to enforce our terms of service.
<br><br>
Purchases<br>
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you. You must provide contact information (such as name and e-mail) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).

<br><br>
Third Party Sites<br>                                                                                                  If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Company site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.  Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as the Company.
