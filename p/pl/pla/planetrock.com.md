6\. Cookies

6.1 You may have read about "cookies".  These are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Planet Rock Ltd uses cookies to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access one of our websites. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.  Occasionally, we may use cookies to track browsing actions or monitor usage patterns on our site.  This helps us administer our websites.  In particular, we may track users as they travel through our websites - for instance, cookies may be used to count the total number of unique users who are accessing our websites over a particular period of time. This information will not be shared with a third party at an individual level, and is used to make our systems more efficient. In addition, cookies can control the display of ads, to ensure that you do not see the same ad too many times in a single session.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will not accept cookies, our website will issue cookies when you log on to the site.  
 

7\. Transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")  
For the reasons set out in this Privacy Policy and for technical and operational reasons, your personal information may from time to time, on our behalf, be transferred, processed or stored on servers based outside of the EEA.  You should be aware that such countries outside of the EEA may not offer the same level of protection for your data.  For example, your data may be processed to allow personalised radio streaming, to process your entry into a competition, to fulfil any order you make for goods or services, to process any payment details or to provide support services. By submitting data to us you consent to such transfer, storing and processing outside the EEA.  We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including steps to help ensure that contractors operating on our behalf are subject to our standard technical and security obligations to provide an adequate level of protection for your information. 

  
8\. Security

8.1 We use up to date industry procedures and technology to keep personal data as safe and secure as possible and to protect against loss, unauthorised disclosure or access. Planet Rock Ltd and our associated companies follow the relevant legal requirements and use all reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the information. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information. 

8.2 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

9\. The Data Protection Act and the Information Commissioner

9.1 In the UK, the Data Protection Act provides a framework for the safety and security of personal data and the uses to which such personal data is put. The Information Commissioner is the UK's independent public body set up to protect personal information and provide information to individuals and organisations.  Please see [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/) for more information. 

9.2 We are registered with the Information Commissioner as a 'data controller' under registration number Z8410660. We will ensure that all personal information supplied by you to us is held and dealt with in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and its relevant subordinate legislation and we will comply with the principles set out in that Act. When you supply any personal information to us we will meet our legal obligations towards you in the way that we deal with that information. In accordance with the data protection principles we must collect personal information fairly and let you know how we will use it and whether we will pass the information on to anyone else. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not supply your personal information to third parties without your express prior consent other than as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will ensure that any information will be held only as long as is necessary to ensure that our service runs smoothly. 

9.3 The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access information held about you.  Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act.  Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
