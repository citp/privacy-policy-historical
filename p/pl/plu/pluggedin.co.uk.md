Cookies may remain on the client's computer merely for the duration of the session (visit) or they may remain indefinitely. Most standard web browsers may be configured to refuse cookies.

Where Pluggedin Directory uses Cookies they do not contain any personal information and cannot be used to identify an individual user.

**Pluggedin Directory Newsletter**

Pluggedin Directory operates an opt-in newsletter mailing list in order to keep in touch with visitors to the website. The procedure for subscribing to the newsletter requires the user to first submit an email address to be subscribed. Our automated system then sends an email message to the email address supplied informing the owner of that email account of the subscription attempt. We include the IP address from which the subscription attempt originated from in this initial message. At this point the email address supplied is not placed on our mailing list. We also include an "abuse" email address in this email to which the recipient of the message may inform us if they believe their email address has been used without their consent. This initial message also contains a "clickable" hyperlink which the owner of the email account must visit in order to confirm their request to subscribe to the newsletter. This hyperlink is generated automatically and contains information unique to the user. This makes it impossible for anyone other than the recipient of the confirmation email to confirm the subscription. Only once the owner of the email account in question has "clicked" this link is the email address originally submitted added to our mailing list.

Whenever we send out a newsletter mailing it includes at the bottom instructions for the user to follow in order to remove them from our mailing list. Included in the instructions is a hyperlink which the recipient of the newsletter may "click" in order to remove themselves automatically and immediately from the mailing list. The recipient of the newsletter can also reply to the email to request that their email address be removed from our mailing list. Users may also contact Pluggedin Directory via our website via the "Unsubscribe" link to request that their email address be removed.

Again we must stress, all requests for manual removal from our newsletter mailing list are removed as soon as possible and, at the latest, BEFORE the next mailing is sent to the list. Automatic removal via the newsletter hyperlink takes place immediately.

**Links to other websites**

Our website contains links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
