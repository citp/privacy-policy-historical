	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
	<div class="container">

<p>Pluggio&nbsp;strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this
privacy policy.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3>How we gather information from users</h3>

<p>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you
register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may
provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most Web sites, Pluggio also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize
you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having
to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather
information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not
to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s
features according to your preferences.
</p>

<h3>What we do with the information we collect</h3>

<p>
Like
other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br><br>Aggregated
Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be
used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to
help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are
visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated
Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and
business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.
</p>

<p>
We may use Personally
Identifiable Information collected on Pluggio to
communicate with you about your registration and customization
preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by Pluggio and other topics we
think you might find of interest. 
</p>

<p>
Personally Identifiable
Information collected by Pluggio may also be used
for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration
of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain
third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.
We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell,
buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We
may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at
other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure in such cases.
</p>

<h3>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</h3>

<p>
Pluggio&nbsp;expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy
of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to
our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Pluggio page, certain content that is actually
created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Pluggio you may be introduced to, or be able to
access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. Pluggio is not
responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You
should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.
</p>

<p>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional
partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to
attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information
about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third
parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and
may use cookies or other technology to gather information. Pluggio does not control the use of this technology
by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible
for any actions or policies of such third parties.
</p>

<p>
You
should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by
third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
beyond the control of Pluggio and this policy.
</p>


<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Pluggio&nbsp;does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable
Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law.
If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13
in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
immediately. If you believe Pluggio has any
information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the
address listed below.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

<p>Pluggio&nbsp;reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this
page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following
the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those
changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted
will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time
the information was collected.</p>

<h3>Governing law</h3>

<p>
This
policy and the use of this Site are governed by California law. If a
dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it
with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following
location: Los Angeles, California, USA. Any costs and fees other than
attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by
each of us.
</p>

<p>
If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually
satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute
to binding arbitration at the following location: Los Angeles, California,
USA, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment
upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court
with jurisdiction to do so.
</p>

<p>
Pluggio&nbsp;is
controlled, operated and administered entirely within California. This
statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do
not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any
party.
