# Privacy policy | Pluralsight

#####  Collection of your Personal Information 

Last updated: April 20, 2015

We value your trust. In order to honor that trust, Pluralsight adheres to ethical standards in gathering, using, and safeguarding any information you provide.

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("personal information"). For example, when you register for an event, we will need your contact information as well as financial information such as a credit card number for billing. We will retain your contact information in a user profile.

As is true of most websites, we gather site-visitation data automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information without first asking your permission.

#####  Use of your Personal Information and Other Data 

**Personal Information** : Pluralsight uses the personal information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide personal information for a certain reason, we will use the personal information that you provide in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you provide personal information in order to register for a program, we will use your personal information to register you for the selected program. We may also use your personal information and other personally non-identifiable information to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site to better understand our users and to improve the site.

**Non-Identifiable Data** : We use our log files to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of our site, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation data.

#####  Disclosure of your Personal Information 

We consider your personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personal information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

**Business Transfers** : As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. Your personal information may be transferred to a buyer or other successor in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event in which personal information held by us about our site users is among the assets transferred.

**Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties** : We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. For instance, we use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies are not permitted to use any personal information that we share with them for any other purpose aside from providing services to us.

**Legal Requirements** : We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our site.

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only collect that personal data that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. This means that we only collect information that is necessary for us to provide you with our services through our website. Furthermore, we will not process your personal information in a way that is incompatible with these purposes.

#####  Control of your Personal Information 

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, our site will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated in this privacy policy. We will also give you the ability to opt out before we disclose your personal information to a third party or use your personal information for purposes that are fundamentally different than the purpose for which it was originally created.

The vast majority of our communication with you will occur through our weblog syndication (RSS feeds). This is naturally an optional service to which you can subscribe using a news aggregator of your choice.

We will occasionally email notices such as date changes for events for which you have enrolled. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.

#####  Access to your Personal Information 

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. If you have filled out a user profile, we will provide an obvious way for you to access and change your profile from our site. We will even allow you to completely delete your profile along with all personal information associated with that profile, although this option will not be available if you are registered for pending events or services. If you wish to make this request, please contact us at support@pluralsight.com.

If you would like view your personal information that we hold at any time, you may either access your profile from our website or you may contact

#####  Security of your Personal Information 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, your information is sent over an authenticated and encrypted connection using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

We store your personal information only on servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities, and use a variety of technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nonetheless, no communication via the Internet can ever be 100% secure. Accordingly, you are advised to use caution and discretion when determining what personal information to disclose to us via the site.

This Privacy Policy applies only to the site. Our site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Sites").

#####  EU and Swiss Safe Harbors 

Pluralsight adheres to the U.S. Department of Commerce's US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework (http://export.gov/safeharbor/) (the "Safe Harbors") with respect to the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Pluralsight has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

We will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding the use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the provisions of this policy.

Pluralsight has committed to provide recourse for individuals to whom privacy data relates and to remedy problems arising out of its failure to comply with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles by cooperating with European Union Data Protection Authorities (DPAs). Pluralsight will cooperate with the DPAs in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Safe Harbor; and Pluralsight will comply with any advice given by the DPAs where the DPAs take the view that Pluralsight needs to take specific action to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles, including remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of individuals affected by any non-compliance with the Principles, and will provide the DPAs with written confirmation that such action has been taken. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Pluralsight, please visit the DPA in your jurisdiction for more information and to file a complaint.
