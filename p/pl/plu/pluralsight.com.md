## pluralsight.com privacy statement

Updated: 1 Aug 2004

#### Collection of your Personal Information

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. For example, when you register for an event, we will need your contact information as well as financial information such as a credit card number for billing. We will retain your contact information in a user profile, but we will not retain your financial information.

As is true of most websites, we gather site-visitation data automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information without first asking your permission.

#### Use of your Personal Information

We use our log files which do not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of pluralsight.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation data.

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

#### Control of your Personal Information

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, pluralsight.com will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.

The vast majority of our communication with you will occur through our weblog syndication (RSS feeds). This is naturally an optional service to which you can subscribe using a news aggregator of your choice.

Pluralsight will occasionally email notices such as date changes for events for which you have enrolled. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.

#### Access to your Personal Information

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. If you have filled out a user profile, we will provide an obvious way for you to access and change your profile from our website. We will even allow you to completely delete your profile, although this option will not be available if you are registered for pending events or services.

#### Security of your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration forms, your information is sent over an authenticated and encrypted connection using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

We store your personal information only on servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities, and use a variety of technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

If you have any questions about security on our website, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.aspx).

#### Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to make our site easier to use. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We do not allow third parties (such as advertisers) to use cookies on our site, or other techniques such as clear gifs or web beacons.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as event enrollment, will be limited. Note that modern browsers allow you to pick and choose which websites should be allowed to receive cookies. For more information on fine grained control of cookies, see [Keith’s article on cookies](http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.CookieArticle).

#### Changes to this Statement

As pluralsight.com evolves, our privacy policy will need to evolve as well to cover new situations. To ensure that you are kept informed of changes, subscribe to our company’s main RSS feed, or check this document periodically, as we will update the date at the top of the document any time we make a change.
