# title.generic.privacy - PluggedIn.com

PluggedIn is fully committed to safeguarding your personal information and protecting any information you provide to it. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") respects and protects the privacy of all visitors to Pluggedin.com and intends to give you as much information and control as possible. 

This Policy is part of Pluggedin’s Terms of Service. By using the Site, you agree to abide and be bound by this Privacy Policy, which may be modified or updated from time to time without notice. It is your responsibility to read the Policy carefully and review any changes that may have been made.

## I. Personal Information

We may collect and process both information that you voluntarily communicate to us in order to access our Service (such as your email and password) and data related to your preferences and traffic (such as your IP address or the modules selected). You do not need to open an account and provide us with personally identifiable information to use our Service. Some personal information may be necessary to access some aspects of our Service. We will never collect or process personal data pertaining to, directly or indirectly, your race, your political, philosophical, or religious views, your health, or your sexual orientation.

If you choose to purchase music or other goods or service by clicking on a third party link (i.e. Amazon) provided on the website, we will not collect any personal information related to the transaction (i.e. credit card number, address, etc.). The only information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is (a) the number of generic Pluggedin users who utilised such links and (b) the number of purchases made by these generic users.

You may provide information for your Public Profile to introduce yourself to other members of our Site, including the information listed above, or other information, but are under no obligation to do so. The information that you provide for your Public Profile will be publicly displayed without restriction on our Site. By providing such information for public display on Pluggedin.com you recognize that it may be considered public domain and as such may be viewed, copied, or re-distributed by anybody who visits our Website. This public information includes without limitation your music preferences and any other information you choose to make available such as your own name, others’ names, images, song names and biographical information.

## II. Music Information

Pluggedin asks for personal information only when it’s necessary in order to deliver value-add service to you. We require certain pieces of information so we can provide you a personalized experience. For example, on Pluggedin.com, our software collects your listening preferences in order to provide you personalized music recommendations, and to allow you to share musical tastes and find other users who have compatible tastes. And while we may use this information for research and to improve the site and services we offer you, except as stated herein or as you specifically give us permission, we promise not to pass on personally identifiable information to third parties.

## III. Email Communication

Except for administrative emails (like important changes to this privacy policy, for example) all other emails we send are under your control. You may register your wishes at the Account Settings section of Pluggedin.com. We issue many types of email communication. The following is a non-comprehensive list: (1) we send a registration email when you first become a member (2) we send a regular opt-in newsletter (3) we provide an opt-in subscription to occasional emails for the announcement of new site features, special events, etc (4) we send invitations or “add friend requests” at the request of your friends who are users of our service; we may send one follow up email to such invitations if they do not generate a response the first time (5) we notify you of updates that have happened to your account, or your profile page (6) we may notify you when you receive messages from other members of the service. In order to make it easier for you to invite friends to use our services, we enable an easy ”address book import” from other online services (such as Hotmail, etc) – this address-book import will only function if you provide a username/password for the other online service, and we use this information to import your address book, but we do not save it. Furthermore, any user who receives unwanted invitations from our Pluggedin.com service is able to block future unsolicited invitations.
