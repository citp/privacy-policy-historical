# Privacy Statement | About PLU | Pacific Lutheran University

### Pacific Lutheran University Statement on Privacy

PLU has an interest in ensuring that the privacy of all of its students, faculty and staff is respected, and that no activities interfere with education, research or residential life.

PLU is private property. However, some common areas of the campus typically are open to visitors. These areas include the Anderson University Center and its public eating areas, Mortvedt Library, outdoor touring areas, and locations to which the public has been invited by advertised notice (such as for public educational, cultural or athletic events). Even in these locations, media representatives must not interfere with the privacy of students, faculty and staff, or with educational, research and residential activities. The University may revoke at any time permission to be present in these, or any other, areas. Media representatives are not authorized to enter academic or residential areas unless they have been invited for appropriate business or social purposes and have the express permission of the responsible faculty member, administrator, residence hall director, or PLU’s division of Marketing & Communications. Moreover, when permission to enter student residences is secured, that permission is limited to common areas such as first-floor lounges and dining areas.

No commercial activity – including the taking of photos or similar audio or visual recordings that are sold to others or otherwise used for commercial purposes – may occur on the campus without the University’s permission. Those involved in unauthorized commercial activity will be asked to leave campus immediately. Requests for permission should be submitted to the office of [Marketing & Communications](http://marcom@plu.edu/) or, as appropriate, to the Department of Athletics. Recognized student groups and official units of the University will be granted such permission so long as they do not violate the privacy or property interests of others; so long as any sale of their products is predominantly on campus to students, faculty and staff; and so long as they comply with applicable University policies and procedures.

Violators of this policy may be subject to criminal and/or civil liability, as well as University disciplinary action.

### Photo & Video Policy

##### General Policy

Pacific Lutheran University is a private university. PLU’s express permission is required for any filming or photography on PLU-owned lands by:

  * News professionals
  * Professional or commercial photographers and filmmakers
  * Campus visitors taking pictures or filming for commercial purposes or using a commercial or professional photographer or filmmaker
  * Anyone taking wedding or portrait photography



Personal photos may be taken by students, parents, faculty, staff, alumni and other campus visitors so long as (i) they are used exclusively for personal, non-commercial purposes, (ii) the taking of such photos is consistent with this policy, including the wedding and portrait photography policy below, and (iii) they do not interfere with the ongoing operations of the university.  PLU will consider requests for use of campus photography and/or video in commercial or marketing usage from groups attending events on campus and other visitors.  Please contact PLU’s Marketing & Communications department for permission at 253-535-7436.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the university reserves the right to prohibit any filming or photography on its lands for any reason, including if the filming or photography creates the potential for: (i) disruption of academic, research, business or student activities; (ii) damage to or alteration of university property; (iii) inappropriate use of the PLU name, marks or image; (iv) disruption of traffic, parking or pedestrian pathways; (v) other safety hazards; or (vi) violations of the university’s privacy policies (see following sections).

#### Photo & Video Opt Out Policy

Pacific Lutheran University may at times use photographs, audio, and/or video recordings of employees and students for purposes of education, publicity, and student recruitment on behalf of the university, via the Internet, print publications, and other media.

#### Opt-Out Form

Should an employee or student (or the parents or guardians of such persons who are under the age of 18) NOT want to be photographed or recorded, or have their name or biographical information used in connection with any such photograph or recording, they must submit a completed Photo Opt-Out Form (see below) to the Marketing & Communications division at [marcom@plu.edu](mailto:marcom@plu.edu).

Individuals who submit a completed Photo Opt-Out Form are also responsible for removing themselves from areas in which photography and/or recording is taking place, or notifying the camera operator of their opt-out status. Failure to do so may result in that individual’s inclusion in a photograph or recording and will be treated as consent for the university to utilize that photograph or recording accordingly.

### Photo/Video Opt-Out

Complete and submit this form for the Marketing & Communications division **ONLY** if you do **NOT** give permission for your photo, audio, or video to appear in university publications and/or publicity, including the campus website and social media. This opt out request is effective for one year (September 1 – August 31). It must be accompanied by a current photo of the student and must be renewed each year in order to be valid. Please be advised that images and videos taken in public spaces and/or public events do not require authorization for publication.

I **do not** authorize Pacific Lutheran University, or its officers, employees or agents, to record my photographs or other images or likenesses in the form of audio, video, or any other medium, or to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or publicly exhibit such recordings, in whole or in part, for any purpose. Further, I do not consent to the use of my name, voice, or biographical material in connection with any such recording.

If you are under 18, a parent or legal guardian of the student must sign and submit this form.

On the following page you will be asked to e-sign this form by using your signature, name, and email address. To complete the e-sign process you will need to follow the verification link sent to the email address you provided.  


[ Need assistance with this form? ](https://forms.plu.edu/forms/help/1546)

##### Public Spaces & Events

Please be advised that images and videos taken in public spaces and/or at public events do not require authorization for publication. Your presence in or around college facilities and/or properties, as well as at off-campus university-sponsored events, constitutes your consent to the capture and/or use of your image and/or voice by PLU, and waives any claims or rights, whether in law or in equity.

**When a completed Photo Opt-Out Form is on file, the university will make every effort to honor that individual’s Opt-Out status, even in public spaces or at public events.**

#### News-related Filming & Photography

PLU Marketing & Communications accommodates reasonable requests for journalistic, news-related, non-commercial shooting, but reserves the right to deny permission when the request runs contrary to university policies – especially those that ensure student privacy. The subject of all news-related filming or photography must be directly related to the university.

##### General Rules for Journalists

  1.  Journalists must adhere to the university’s privacy policies.  No one at PLU can be filmed without his or her permission, except at public events to which the public and media have been invited.
  2. Permission to shoot news-related photography or filming in interior spaces is required in all circumstances. This includes administration and office buildings, classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and dining facilities.

  4. Journalists are discouraged from doing “person-on-the-street” interviews at PLU without assistance from Marketing & Communications.

##### Requesting Assistance

#### Wedding & Portrait Photography

People with a PLU connection—meaning, for instance, the bride or groom is an alum, student, faculty member or staff member—may request permission to conduct wedding and portrait photography and filming.  Requests for permission must be received at least five business days in advance.

  * Name of the person making the request, his or her affiliation to the university and contact information.

  * The use of drones for filming or photography is prohibited without prior approval, proof of current FAA certification, and proof of required insurance (see Non-News Filming or Photography). Additionally, the university requires written approval from Joint Base Lewis McChord due to PLU’s location within a five-mile radius of the air base.
  * Use of PLU’s name, other trademarks and emblems, or images in connection with any photograph or film is prohibited without written permission by the university.
  * Indoor shooting at PLU is prohibited without permission by the university as described above and, in addition, permission by the university official or faculty member with responsibility for the space.  Indoor shooting is considered inherently disruptive of the functions of the university and requires written permission.
  * Filming or photography on PLU’s campus for academic purposes is limited only to PLU students, staff and faculty and others attending PLU academic programs, PLU-sponsored programs and other programs which occur on PLU’s campus and for which photography is part of the program.
