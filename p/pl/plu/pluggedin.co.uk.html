<tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="top" class="link10"><p align="left" class="link10"><strong>Pluggedin Directory  Privacy Policy </strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">This  policy explains what information is gathered from web clients visiting  Pluggedin Directory web server, and how that information is used.

    <p align="left" class="link10">How we use the information<br>
      The information you supply to us is used in the following ways:<br>
      If you register to receive your  email newsletter, we will use your personal information:</p>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <p align="left" class="link10"><strong>Log files</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Pluggedin Directory web server tracks requests made of it to centrally held log  files. Log files can contain any or all of the following types of data:</p>
    <div align="left">
      <ul>
        <li class="link10">The date and time of connection</li>
        <li class="link10">Identification of the file(s) requested</li>
        <li class="link10">Whether the request was successful</li>
        <li class="link10">The size (in bytes) sent in response</li>
        <li class="link10">The referring page (where the client came from), as supplied by the client browser</li>
        <li class="link10">The software used to access the server, as supplied by the client browser</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Information  gathered is used for server system administration, identifying broken  links, and for producing usage statistics. Logged information may be  kept indefinitely. Log files do not contain any personal information.  Examples of data collected automatically from all users include:</p>
    <div align="left">
      <ul>
        <li class="link10"> the Internet protocol (IP) address</li>
        <li class="link10">computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform</li>
        <li class="link10">Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") click stream data, including date and time, and content viewed or searched for on the Site.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p align="left" class="link10"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Cookies  are small files that are sent from the web server to the client's  computer via the client's browser. They are then stored in the client's  computer as text files and passed back to the server. Cookies are  generally used to identify users and on occasion, prepare customized  Web pages for them. Cookies may remain on the client's computer merely  for the duration of the session (visit) or they may remain  indefinitely. Most standard web browsers may be configured to refuse  cookies.</p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Where Pluggedin Directory uses  Cookies they do not contain any personal information and cannot be used  to identify an individual user.</p>
    <p align="left" class="link10"><strong>Pluggedin Directory Newsletter</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Pluggedin Directory operates an opt-in newsletter mailing list in order to keep in  touch with visitors to the website. The procedure for subscribing to  the newsletter requires the user to first submit an email address to be  subscribed. Our automated system then sends an email message to the  email address supplied informing the owner of that email account of the  subscription attempt. We include the IP address from which the  subscription attempt originated from in this initial message. At this  point the email address supplied is not placed on our mailing list. We  also include an "abuse" email address in this email to which the  recipient of the message may inform us if they believe their email  address has been used without their consent. This initial message also  contains a "clickable" hyperlink which the owner of the email account  must visit in order to confirm their request to subscribe to the  newsletter. This hyperlink is generated automatically and contains  information unique to the user. This makes it impossible for anyone  other than the recipient of the confirmation email to confirm the  subscription. Only once the owner of the email account in question has  "clicked" this link is the email address originally submitted added to  our mailing list.</p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Whenever we send out a  newsletter mailing it includes at the bottom instructions for the user  to follow in order to remove them from our mailing list. Included in  the instructions is a hyperlink which the recipient of the newsletter  may "click" in order to remove themselves automatically and immediately  from the mailing list. The recipient of the newsletter can also reply  to the email to request that their email address be removed from our  mailing list. Users may also contact Pluggedin Directory via our website  via the "Unsubscribe" link to request that their email address be removed.</p>
    <p align="left" class="link10">Again  we must stress, all requests for manual removal from our newsletter  mailing list are removed as soon as possible and, at the latest, BEFORE  the next mailing is sent to the list. Automatic removal via the  newsletter hyperlink takes place immediately.</p>
    <p><strong>Links to other websites    </strong></p>
    <p align="left">Our  website contains links to other websites of interest. However, once you  have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not  have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be  responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you  provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by  this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the  privacy statement applicable to the website in question. </p></td>
