At www.plumbworld.co.uk, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience.

_What information do we collect? How do we use it?_

When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your orders and to notify you of your order status. We also ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order.

We personalise your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations and special offers about products that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the store.

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new www.plumbworld.co.uk services and special offers we think you'll find valuable, as well as any market research purposes.

_How does[www.plumbworld.co.uk](http://www.plumbworld.co.uk/) protect customer information?_

Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.

_Will[www.plumbworld.co.uk](http://www.plumbworld.co.uk/) disclose the information it collects to outside parties? _

We will never divulge any of your personal details, by which we mean your name and address or email address, to any third party for them to market un-related products or services to you. We may use your details to advise you of money saving offers, or major changes at www.plumbworld.co.uk. We may subcontract a third party to mail offers to you from ourselves but they will also be bound not to divulge your personal information to third parties.
