# Pluck: Privacy Policy

Pluck is committed to protecting your privacy and respects the privacy of individuals who use Pluck's software and services. This Privacy Statement covers how Pluck treats personal information that is either collected or received. This includes, but is not limited to email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses, age, gender, and interests.

### Use of your personal information

Pluck currently collects personal information, including email addresses, when a user of the Pluck software registers to use the optional synchronized bookmarks and link sharing services. Pluck also monitors usage information from web servers owned by Pluck, including page views, product usage and download counts, obtained during the normal course of use of Pluck's software and services. Unless required by law, Pluck will not share your personal information, except in aggregate or anonymous form, with third parties.

### Use of third party affiliate programs and ad networks

Pluck may allow other companies (affiliates) to display ads and services on Pluck web pages and software. Some affiliate partners or programs may place a persistent cookie on your computer or retrieve an IP address. Although Pluck makes every effort to ensure your privacy, Pluck does not have any control over the policies of affiliate partners. Users should see individual partner's privacy statements for their privacy policies.

## Adware and spyware

Pluck contains no spyware or adware. It is our mission to build great software that makes web browsing easier, more fun, and more relevant — without presenting disruptive ads or invading the privacy of our users. 

### What is spyware?

Spyware is software that is installed without the user's permission or understanding that tracks usage patterns and computer activity. This software performs functions that would commonly be viewed as invasive or anti-privacy, and extends beyond the basics of cookies and usage metrics.

### What is adware?

Adware is software that is installed without the user's permission or knowledge. Once installed, adware introduces unwanted pop-ups or other forms of advertising that are disruptive to the user's online computing experience. Typically adware continues to display ads even when the user is not using the software that initially carried the adware.

  
_Pluck reserves the right to modify all or some of this privacy statement at any time without notice._
