	<h2 class="about_title"> Privacy Policy  </h2>
	<p>
	We take your privacy very seriously. Information you share with us is used for Plusmo's business
	purposes. Plusmo is not in the business of selling information about you. This notice tells you what
	information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share the information,
	and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.
	</p>
	<h4>Information We Collect</h4>

	<h4>Information voluntarily provided by you</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>
	Not all Plusmo services require you to provide personal information. You may use several areas of the
	site such as search, view content or browse the site without registering on the site.
	</li>
	<li>
	When you decide to subscribe to content from our site to your phone, we ask for your mobile phone
	number, your mobile operator and email address. This creates an account for you on our site.
	We need this information to deliver the service to your device.
	</li>
	<li>
	When you download the Plusmo software onto your mobile phone, it includes a unique identifying number
	so that we provide a personalized experience to your mobile phone.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Automatic Data Collection</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>
	"Cookies" are small files web sites place on your hard drive that allow sites to identify you.
	The use of cookies is a common practice on many web sites. For example, if you allow a site to remember
	your login name or password, the site places a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other
	information on your hard drive. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you.
	We may use cookies to measure web site traffic, to offer you certain services, or to customize your
	visit. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking
	user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to
	refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services may
	not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
	</li>
	<li>
	An "IP address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
	In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a
	consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.
	</li>
	<li>
	Plusmo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including
	your IP address, the date and time of your query, browser type, cookie information, and the page you
	request. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.
	</li>
	<li>
	Plusmo also receives information about your mobile phone when you access the service from your mobile
	phone. This is non personal information that we use to help us identify your phone, and information
	about your phone such as screen dimensions, the kind of media formats supported by your phone, and
	memory available for use. We use this information to improve our service and support tailoring the
	service to the device (such as resizing pictures, restricting the amount of content based on your
	available memory).
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>How we use the Information</h4>
	<p>We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to third parties.</p>

	Mobile Phone Number and Mobile Operator: We use this to send an SMS/ Text message (Short Message Service)
	to the your phone, and to uniquely identify your account.
	</li>
	<li>
	Mobile Phone Type: We use this information to deliver the right version of software that is suited to
	your mobile phone. (such as a J2ME compatible version or Windows Mobile compatible version of
	the software).
	</li>
	<li>
	Email address: If your mobile phone supports emails, we may use this to send you a link to download the
	Software to your phone and to uniquely identify your account. We will send you administrative messages
	and email updates regarding your account. We may also send you notices of new content that has been
	added in which you may be interested, as part of the Plusmo service.  In some cases, we may also send you
	primarily promotional messages. You may opt out of receiving any of these messages by canceling your
	User account.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<p>

	use.  We store your account information on a secure server, and use procedures designed to protect the
	personal information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or
	destruction.
	</p>
	<p>
	Although we will take (and require our third-party providers to take) commercially reasonable security
	precautions regarding your personal information collected from and stored on the Site, due to the open

	We follow commercially reasonable security precautions to protect the personal information submitted to
	us, both during the transmission and once we receive it.
