              <p align="left">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
              <p align="left">Our site strives to offer its visitors the many 
                advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive 
                and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
                Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone 
                number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never 
                sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third 
                party. Period."</p>
              <p align="left">How we gather information from users</p>
              <p align="left">How we collect and store information depends on 
                the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
                participate and the services provided. For example, you may be 
                asked to provide information when you register for access to certain 
                portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters 
                or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when 
                you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and 
                chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most 
                Web sites, Our site also collects information automatically 
                and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent 
                to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
                Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
                hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie 
                may store your user name and password, sparing you from having 
                to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control 
                the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while 
                visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 
                gather information through other means. In certain cases, you 
                can choose not to provide us with information, for example by 
                setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do 
                you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may 
                be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not 
                be able to customize the site’s features according to your 
                preferences.</p>
              <p align="left">What we do with the information we collect</p>
              <p align="left">Like other Web publishers, we collect information 
                to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content 
                and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your 
                information with anyone.</p>
              <p align="left">Aggregated Information (information that does not 
                personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, 
                we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar 
                information obtained from other users to help enhance our site 
                and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what 
                features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally 
                be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this 
                information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information 
                about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
              <p align="left">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected 
                on Our site to communicate with you about your registration 
                and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy 
                policy; services and products offered by Our site 
                and other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
              <p align="left">Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
                Our site may also be used for other purposes, including 
                but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing 
                of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and 
                contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties 
                who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our 
                Web hosting service for example) may access such information. 
                We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, 
                from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may 
                sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. 
                In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred 
                assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a 
                court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably 
                required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of 
                amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities 
                whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may 
                not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
              <p align="left">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
              <p align="left">Our site expects its partners, advertisers 
                and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, 
                however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, 
                affiliates and other content providers accessible through our 
                site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies 
                and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you 
                may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Our site 
                page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a 
                third party. Also, through Our site you may be introduced 
                to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests 
                or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Our site 
                is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. 
                You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third 
                parties when providing information on a feature or page operated 
                by a third party.</p>
              <p align="left">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional 
                partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology 
                to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information 
                about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third 
                parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to 
                determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. 
                Other features available on our site may offer services operated 
                by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather 
                information. Our site does not control the use of 
                this technology by third parties or the resulting information, 
                and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third 
                parties.</p>
              <p align="left">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily 
                disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards 
                or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and 
                can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
                and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals 
                or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Our site 
                and this policy.</p>
              <p align="left">Children</p>
              <p align="left">Our site does not knowingly collect 
                or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children 
                under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received 
                any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, 
                we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Our site 
                has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact

                changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting

              <p align="left">This policy and the use of this Site are governed 
                by UK law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first 
                try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator 
                in the following location: Lancashire, UK. Any costs and fees 
                other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be 
                shared equally by each of us.</p>
              <p align="left">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually 
                satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit the 
                dispute to binding arbitration at the following location: Lancashire, 
                UK, under the rules of the British Justice System. Judgment upon 
                the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court 
                with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
