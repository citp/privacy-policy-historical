## 1\. Introduction

Plug.DJ respects your privacy and the security of your personal information, and we want to do as much as we can to protect it. Because of this, we have created this Privacy Policy to govern how we deal with your personal information. Since our Site is built off of Content that you provide, including shared information from third party sites, it is important that you read and understand their information sharing policies as well. Please check back often, as we will update this Privacy Policy as we grow.

## 2\. Personal Information We Collect

In order for you to sign up for our service, we may ask for personal information from you including your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, photo, username from other social media sites, gender, date of birth, or other relevant information. In addition, we utilize third party API’s like Facebook Connect, Twitter OAuth, and other API’s that allow you to transfer your profile information from those Sites to ours depending on your settings on those Sites. We are not responsible for any information that does not transfer or if any information is inaccurate.
