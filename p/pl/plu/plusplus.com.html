<p style="text-align: center;font-size:18px;"><strong><span class="logoRed">ng</span><span class="logoBlue">moco</span><span class="logoRed">:)</span> Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>As used in this Privacy
Policy, "ngmoco", "we", "us", or "our"
refer to ngmoco, LLC, and all of its subsidiaries.
</p>
<p>Your privacy is important
to ngmoco.  We designed our Privacy Policy to cover how we collect,
use, disclose, transfer and store your information.  Please familiarize
yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any
questions. </p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies
only to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that
you may decide to provide to us in your use of: (i) our applications
for mobile platforms or devices and our web applications accessible
on third party social networking services ("<strong>SNS</strong>") (collectively,
our mobile and web applications are referred to herein as ("<strong>ngmoco
Applications</strong>"), (ii) our game publisher networks, crowd sourcing
service and platforms ("<strong>Networks</strong>") provided in connection
with ngmoco Applications and Third-Party Mobile Applications (defined
below), (iii) our portal for third-party publishers ("<strong>mobage Developer
Portal</strong>"), (iv) our web domains and subdomains, including <a href="http://ngmoco.com" target="_blank">ngmoco.com</a>,
<a href="http://plusplus.com" target="_blank">plusplus.com</a> and <a href="http://mobage.com" target="_blank">mobage.com</a> (collectively, our "<strong>Sites</strong>"),
and web forums or messaging boards in ngmoco Applications and our Sites
(collectively, our "<strong>Forums</strong>").  Any and all of our ngmoco
Applications, Networks, mobage Developer Portal, Sites and Forums are
referred to herein as our "<strong>Services</strong>". </p>
<p>We reserve the right
to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy
Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in our Services and
on the Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update
the "Last Updated Date" in the Privacy Policy. By continuing to
access or use the Services after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy
or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating
that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified
Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease
using the Services. </p>
<p>Please visit this page
periodically to remain up-to-date as to any Privacy Policy changes.
Take a moment now to read the following to learn about our information
collection practices that may impact you as a registered user with full
access to our Services or a non-registered user of our Services (each
a "<strong>ngmoco User</strong>"). For information regarding the collection
and use of Personal Information (defined below) from children under
14 years old, see the Section below, entitled "Our Policy Toward Children".
</p>
<p><strong>We Collect Personal
Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p>In the course of using
our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable
information that can be used to contact or identify you.  Personally
identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name,
phone number, photo representation ("<strong>avatar</strong>"), email address
and mailing address ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").  We will
collect, use, transfer and disclose Personal Information in accordance
with our Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>We also collect non-personal
information, which is data in a form that does not permit direct association
with you or any specific individual ("<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>").
Non-Identifying Information is aggregated and used to help improve our
Services and Third Party Mobile Applications (defined below) by providing
a better way to understand the ngmoco User experience with the level
of interest in various portions of our Sites, specific ngmoco Applications
or specific Third-Party Mobile Applications. We may collect, use, transfer
and disclose Non-Identifying Information for any purpose; details provided
in this Privacy Policy about what Non-Identifying Information we collect
currently, and how we use, transfer and disclose such Non-Identifying
Information concern only how such information is collected and used
today.  </p>
<p>Both Personal Information
or Non-Identifying Information may be used alone or in the aggregate
with information collected from other ngmoco Users. Our primary objective
in collecting any Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information
is to provide you with a superior and personally relevant user experience.
</p>
<p><strong>How we use your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be used, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help us to develop, deliver, and improve our Services and advertising;</li>
<li>To recommend products of interest directly to you;</li>
<li>For market research purposes that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable service to our community of ngmoco Users;
<ul>
<li>For example, we may use your Personal Information to contact you with announcements, newsletters and promotional materials related to our Services or to offer you opportunities to participate  in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a "Promotion") via our Services.
<ul>
<li>If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See "Changing or Removing Information" below for further information.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To allow us to keep you posted regarding our latest Service announcements, software updates, and upcoming events;</li>
<li>To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to our <a href="http://www.ngmoco.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, or other Service-specific   policies. Because this information is important to your interactions with ngmoco, you may not opt out of receiving these communications; and</li>
<li>To audit and analyze data to improve our Services and customer communications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When We Collect Information</strong></p>
<p>One of the instances
when we collect your Personal Information is in connection with your
registration on our Services. </p>
<p>If you are an ngmoco
User, you can register either via an ngmoco Application or via a third-party
application utilizing our Services ("<strong>Third Party Mobile Application</strong>")
that was designed for mobile telephones or other mobile devices by a
third-party publisher ("<strong>Third Party Publisher</strong>").
</p>
<p>In connection with registration
of ngmoco Users on our Services, we collect Personal Information which
may include your email address, as well as information on mobile device
type, mobile carrier, unique mobile device identifier ("Device ID"),
Internet Protocol ("IP") address and geo location, as applicable.
We use your Device ID to make it possible to authenticate and understand
your use of our Services, or the Third Party Mobile Application that
you may choose to access through our Services. </p>
<p>Related to this information
collection, our Services may serve ads that contain links to other Third-Party
Mobile Applications, and we may utilize your Device ID to track clicks
or other ad fulfillment metrics. Our use of your Device ID does not
enable us to identify you personally, and we do not store this information
in connection with your ngmoco User account information.
</p>
<p>If you are a Third Party
Publisher, you can register to develop Third Party Mobile Applications
via our Sites. In connection with registration as a Third Party Publisher,
we may collect your name, mailing address, email address and telephone
number. We collect this Personal Information to ensure that we are able
to contact you. </p>
<p>You may also be asked
explicitly to provide Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information
anytime that you are in contact with ngmoco or an ngmoco-affiliated
company.  If your Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information
is shared with our affiliates, such sharing will be in accordance with
this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Other instances when
Personal Information may be collected via our Services include the following:
</p>
<p>If you choose to link
your ngmoco account to an SNS, Personal Information that you independently
submit to an SNS (e.g., Facebook) may be collected and used by us in
order to provide you with enhanced functionality. In these instances,
you consent to ngmoco’s access and use of your username, alias and
any other Personal Information you have independently provided to and
made accessible through the SNS. Such access will be in accordance with
the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Similarly,
we may use Personal Information that you have provided to us to help
you establish social connections with other ngmoco Users.
</p>
<p>If you choose to participate
in a Promotion, We may request that you provide us with Personal Information
such as your email address or mailing address in order to administer
your participation in the Promotion. </p>
<p>In connection with use
of our Services or Third-Party Mobile Applications, in addition to information
on device type, mobile carrier, IP address, platform version, and geo-location,
as applicable, we may also collect navigation, interaction and engagement
information regarding ngmoco Users.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain Non-Identifying
Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information
if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip
code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information
when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying
Information (e.g., your viewing preferences).
</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Other
Technologies</strong></p>
<p>As is standard practice,
we use "cookies" to help us study traffic patterns and understand
the effectiveness of our marketing communications. A cookie is a small
string of text that we send to your computer’s or mobile device’s
browser. Other types of cookies exist, but the cookies we use in connection
with our Services are only used to obtain browser-specific information.
For example, we do not use cookies to retrieve data from your hard drive,
pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies we
use can reveal, for instance, which pages are the most popular, how
much time ngmoco Users are spending there, and how they are interacting
with the content on such pages. </p>
<p>You have the option to
disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting
cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you
visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to
view or use all portions of our Services due to limited functionality.
</p>
<p>Some of our Services,
including email messaging, use "click-through URLs" linked
to other content on our Services. We track this click-through data to
help us determine interest in topics, Services usability and other measures
of ngmoco User engagement. </p>
<p>We may also use "pixel
tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar
means (individually or collectively "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>") in connection
with our Services and to collect usage, demographic and geographical
location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel
that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies
on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have
visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services and
to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
</p>
<p>When you use our Services
or Third-Party Mobile Applications, our servers automatically record
information that your browser or the applicable Service or Third-Party
Mobile Application sends ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log Data may
include information such as your computer’s or mobile device’s IP
address, browser type, language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring
and exit pages, time spent, information searched for, time and date
stamp, clickstream data and other statistics. We use this information
to monitor, analyze and understand trends, for technical administration
of Services and Third-Party Mobile Applications, and to gather demographic
information about our ngmoco User base as a whole.  We, and Third
Party Publishers may use this information for product and services improvements,
and in marketing and advertising services. </p>
<p>BY CLICKING ON THE "SIGN UP"
BUTTON, WHERE APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SERVICES
YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
ON YOUR DEVICE. </p>
<p><strong>When We Disclose Your
Information Within ngmoco Services</strong></p>
<p>As a user with an account,
you may create your own profile, connect with other ngmoco Users of
Services, send messages and transmit information through various channels.
Please remember that any communications you have via our Services, depending
on, for example, the functionality of any ngmoco Application or Third-Party
Mobile Application connected to our Services, may reveal your screen
name and the content of your communications, making this information
publicly available to other ngmoco Users. ngmoco is not responsible
for the activities of other ngmoco Users or other third parties with
whom you choose to provide your Personal Information or otherwise interact.
</p>
<p><strong>With Third Parties
for Industry Analysis</strong></p>
<p>In addition to sharing
aggregated Non-Identifying Information with Third Party Publishers,
we may also share aggregated Non-Identifying Information with advertisers
and ad networks ("<strong>Advertising Entities</strong>") with whom we have
strategic relationships. Unless you specifically opt in to share your
Personal Information, the information that we share with these third
parties will only be used in the form of Non-Identifying Information
to support user trend analyses and demographic profiling. Some Third
Party Publishers and Advertising Entities also act as Service Providers
(defined below) to us, so in those cases we will share your information
as described below. </p>
<p><strong>With Preferred Partners</strong></p>
<p>We may share your username,
email address and Device ID (collectively, "<strong>Specific Shared Data</strong>")
with certain of our Third Party Publishers and other business partners
("<strong>Preferred Partners</strong>") for those parties to assist us with
providing you with the aspect of the Services for which you provided
such Specific Shared Data to us, and to use such Specific Shared Data
to provide you with information and marketing materials about Third
Party Mobile Applications and other products and services in order,
for example, to further enhance your use of our Services and to augment
your gaming and social networking experience generally. In addition,
in the event of a user inquiry concerning Third Party Publishers or
Third Party Applications, we may send Specific Shared Data as well as
the inquiry to the Third Party Publisher to address the inquiry.
</p>
<p>We only share such information
with Preferred Partners pursuant to an agreement by which the Preferred
Partner is under obligations not to disclose or use it for any other
purpose. You may contact us by any of the means provided in the "Contacting
Us" section below to request not to have such information provided
to Preferred Partners, understanding, however, that if such information
is not shared with Preferred Partners it may affect your ability to
use or access portions of the Services. </p>
<p>Some Preferred Partners
also act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, and in those cases
we may also share Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information
as described below.  </p>
<p><strong>With Third
Party Social Networking Services (SNSs)</strong></p>
<p>As a user with an account,
you may link your ngmoco account information with certain SNSs where
other ngmoco Users have existing SNS accounts. In these instances, with
your permission and on your behalf, we will share your email address
and screen name or alias with the applicable SNS. Through use of such
services’ application programming interfaces (APIs) we can receive
certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in
accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account,
if any. </p>
<p>Other than what we may
share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the
personal information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent
of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the
use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We
encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other
services you use. </p>
<p><strong>With our Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>Disclosure of your Personal
Information and Non-Identifying Information may also occur where we
engage or employ service providers, vendors or other third party entities
to facilitate provision of our Services (each a "<strong>Service Provider</strong>")
(e.g., without limitation, improvement of our Services’ features,
user account authentication, promotion and marketing, administration,
analytics, virtual currency transactions, crowd-sourcing, cloud storage
and other related services), to provide the Services on our behalf,
or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service
Providers may have access to your Personal Information only to perform
these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it
for any other purpose. </p>
<p><strong>Under Special Circumstances</strong></p>
<p>At times, we may disclose
information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties
as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond
to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas),
to protect the property and rights of ngmoco or a third party, to protect
the safety of the public or any person or to prevent or stop activity
we may consider to be or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical
or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>Under another special
set of circumstances, for example, in connection with a merger, acquisition,
reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, we
may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of ngmoco assets,
including your Personal Information. </p>
<p><strong>Our Policy Toward
Children</strong></p>
<p>Our Services are not
intended for children under the age of 14 ("children") and we do
not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children. If we
discover that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from
children, we will take all reasonable measures to erase such information
from our systems and records as soon as possible.
</p>
<p><strong>Use as a Non-Registered
User</strong></p>
<p>In certain ngmoco Applications,
an ngmoco User may participate as a non-registered ngmoco User through
optional registration. This allows an ngmoco User to play the game in
a limited capacity. Ngmoco does not collect any Personal Information
or Non-Identifying information, other than Device ID, for non-registered
users. ngmoco cannot and does not ensure the preservation of game data
that is associated with any non-registered account.
</p>
<p><strong>Location-Based Services</strong></p>
<p>For location-based Services,
we may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the
real-time geographic location of your computer or mobile device. Unless
you explicitly opt-in to permit the use and sharing of your Personal
Information regarding your geographic location, your location data will
only be collected and used anonymously in a form that does not personally
identify you. When you opt in to Third Party Mobile Application providers’
location services, we will share your geographic location with such
Third Party Mobile Application providers in connection with their location
services.  Please note that some location-based services may require
your Personal Information for the feature to work as intended.
</p>
<p><strong>Invite-A-Friend</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to use
our referral services to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask
you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically
send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to use an aspect
of our Services. ngmoco hashes these email addresses after using them
for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
</p>
<p> <strong>Find-A-Friend</strong></p>
<p>After an ngmoco User
logs into his or her account, the ngmoco User can access the find our
find-a-friend feature. We present ngmoco Users with options to search
for a friend or group of friends. Options include, but are not limited
to, searching one of our Networks, scanning the ngmoco User’s mobile
device, and scanning the ngmoco User’s Facebook, Google or Yahoo!
contacts. The ngmoco User may either add an existing ngmoco User, or
invite a friend to join the Service through the third-party service.
To facilitate, ngmoco will provide interfaces to authenticate to such
third-party service. We do not store the ngmoco User’s login credentials.
The ngmoco User who uses this feature is bound by the terms of the third-party
service.    </p>
<p><strong>Emailing Via a ngmoco
Application</strong></p>
<p>ngmoco Users may send
pre-formatted messages through use of their personal email account connected
to their mobile device to, for example, challenge their friends to beat
their high score in an ngmoco Application where this functionality is
available. ngmoco may store the email address of the friend that you
choose to email via our Services, but would only do so for social purposes
such as generating friend recommendations (e.g., in connection with
"people you may know" functionality). The message you initiate will
be sent through your personal email account to the email addresses you
choose. </p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your
Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>ngmoco takes your privacy
very seriously and employs administrative, physical and electronic measures
to safeguard your information from identity theft and unauthorized access.
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information,
your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in
a non-secure or unsolicited communication (e.g. via e-mail, telephone,
mobile device). </p>
<p>We will make any legally
required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality,
or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data"
(as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification)
to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Sites in the most expedient
time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent
with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
integrity of the data system. </p>
<p><strong>Changing or Removing
Information</strong></p>
<p>As a user of an account,
you may update or delete the Personal Information in your profile by
logging into your account. You may also email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>
to request that we delete your Personal Information from our database.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We
may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for
legitimate business purposes. Specific Shared Data cannot be retrieved
from Preferred Partners after its disclosure. </p>
<p>Where you share information
with other users through the communication channels of our Services,
you generally should not expect to have any ability to modify or remove
such communications.  Nor should you expect us to modify or delete
your comments upon your request. </p>
<p>If you participate in
a Promotion hosted by us (where you may or may not disclose the information
requested), you have the option to opt out at any time from such participation
and the receipt of any related communications. Please follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in the relevant communications.
</p>
<p>If your friend received
an invitation from ngmoco per your referral to try the Services, your
friend may request that the name and email address used in the invitation
be removed from ngmoco’s records. We store this information for the
sole purposes of measuring the effectiveness of our referral program
and sending the email you initiated, but your friend can request to
have it removed from our database by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Websites
and Services</strong></p>
<p>Our Services may contain
links to other websites and online services or offers from third parties.
For example, our Services may include offers from third party advertisers
or the ability to engage in transactions with such entities. If an ngmoco
User with an account chooses to participate in offer-linked information
requests or "clicks on" an advertisement or another third party
link, such ngmoco User may be directed to that third party’s website
or service and/or be prompted to provide Personal Information in connection
with such activity. </p>
<p>The fact that we link
to a third party website or service is not an endorsement or representation
of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of
such third party’s privacy or information security policies or practices
or their compliance with laws. We do not exercise control over third
party websites or services. These other websites or services may place
their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile devices,
collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites
and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure
of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to
read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services
you use and the terms of the offers in which you participate. You agree
that ngmoco is not responsible for, nor will it be liable to you or
any third party for, your interaction with such third parties or the
information requests initiated by such third parties or the subsequent
use, treatment or dissemination of the information you voluntarily choose
to provide to them. </p>
<p><strong>Non-US Users</strong></p>
<p>Information that you
provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world
as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you are located outside
the United States, you understand that we transfer Personal Information
to and process it in the United States. Your consent to this Privacy
Policy followed by your submission of Personal Information represents
your agreement to that transfer. </p>
<p>ngmoco abides by the<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.export.gov%2Fsafeharbor%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9QgCaLqAyA2T7o5Awc8XT4hO8Mg" target="_blank">safe harbor framework</a> ("Safe Harbor") developed by the US Department
of Commerce and the European Union and Switzerland regarding the collection,
use, and retention of personal information from individuals who reside
in the European Union and Switzerland.  As detailed in this Privacy
Policy, we specifically agree to comply with each of the seven Safe
Harbor privacy principles for the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018476.asp" target="_blank">European Union and Switzerland</a>:  Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer (Transfers

<p>Individuals who wish
to file a complaint or who take issue with our Safe Harbor policies
should direct such communication to us as specified in the Contacting
Us section below.  If you are sending us a privacy-related complaint,
please provide it in English because this will help expedite the process.
</p>
<p>We will investigate and
attempt to resolve complaints regarding use and disclosure of personal
information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy
Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved between ngmoco and a
complainant, we commit to cooperate with data protection authorities
located in the European Union, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and
Information Commissioner, or their authorized representatives to resolve
such disputes. </p>

Rights</strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code
Section 1798.83 permits customers of ngmoco who are California residents

information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If
you are a California resident and have provided ngmoco with personal
information within the last year, you may make such a request by emailing
us at the following email address with the email’s subject titled
as "California Privacy Rights": <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>.

such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal
information disclosed to third parties for such third parties’
direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar
year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. A request
may be made no more than once per calendar year and we are not required
to respond to requests made by means other than through the email address
above. </p>

Privacy Policy is for purposes of convenience only and the English version
