<div style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information</strong><br> To process and provide the travel services you request and purchase, we may share your Personal Information with our third-party travel providers, such as airlines, hotels, car rental companies, ground transportation, cruise, activity and travel protection plan providers, who fulfill your travel reservations on our behalf.  These third-party travel providers may need information about your profile to process and facilitate your travel reservation.  Personal Information shared may include full name including middle name or initial, gender, date of birth (as well as the full names, gender and date of birth of others accompanying you) and TSA Redress Number (if any).

To process and confirm your travel reservations and/or purchases, our third-party partners may also collect Personal Information including your name, residence address, telephone numbers, date of birth, payment card information and e-mail address.  We do not manage or control the privacy policies of these third-party business partners and encourage you to review the privacy policies of third-party partner sites whose services you consider using.</div>
<div style="padding-top:10px;">When required by law, legal process, or government, we may disclose information we have collected from visitors when they purchase travel products or services, or apply for employment.  In certain cases involving fraud or illegal activities, we may disclose information to investigate, prevent or protect our interests, property, or safety of employees or customers.  Additionally, it may become necessary to provide customer information to payment card companies, for the purpose of resolving chargebacks or disputes that arise in the normal course of business.</div>
<div style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br> When you visit our site, we may assign a “cookie” (a small, unique identifier text file) and a web beacon (a small transparent image file) which is very common on the Internet.  You do not provide this information, as it is collected automatically and used in a variety of ways to optimize visits to our site, including the use of third-party services for improving the user’s overall site experience.  The cookie and web beacon do not contain any Personal Information, but collect your IP address.  You have the ability not to receive a cookie file and to disable a web beacon by enabling your Web Browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie.

We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features these third party advertising networks may use, and their information practices are not covered by this Privacy Statement.</div>
<div style="padding-top:10px;"><strong>Tracking</strong><br> We do not respond to a web browser's "Do Not Track" signal.  Such a signal enables a person to opt out from having information about their web browsing activities monitored and collected; however, since there is not uniform industry agreement as to how to respond, we do not currently honor such a request.</div>
