<p><strong>Site Security<br></strong>In creating and providing you with our privacy policy, we are underscoring an ongoing commitment to protecting all Personal Identifying Information you provide us.&nbsp; Personal Identifying Information is information about you that is personally identifiable and includes your name, date of birth, address, email address, phone number(s), and credit card information.&nbsp; We want visitors to our Web site to feel comfortable and confident planning and purchasing travel. To protect your Personal Identifying Information, our Web site uses some of the latest security technology. High-security firewalls and a secure server that sends and receives encrypted data provide among the highest levels of protection available.&nbsp; However, you should know that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; Although not all pages that collect Personal Identifying Information are secure, we secure all pages collecting credit card information including card number, card type, cardholder name and expiration date. This Web site is a Verisign certified site. Verisign is a central certificate authority issuing digital IDs to Internet Web sites -- further improving the integrity of the Internet for commerce and information access.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Browsers</strong><br>While Pleasantholidays.com supports all SSL compliant browsers, we recommend that you use version 5.0 or higher of Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer.

You should obtain consent of other individuals who may accompany you prior to providing their names, as they may be unable to view or change any information you provide on their behalf. For specified travel purchases, we may also collect the name of the airline you will use, and flight number(s).&nbsp; When you purchase travel with us, you will receive confirmation of your travel itinerary via e-mail.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Disclosure and Disputes</strong> <br>When required by law, we may disclose information we have collected from customers when they purchased travel products or services. In certain cases involving fraud, we may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to our interests or whose activities could bring harm to others. Additionally, it may become necessary to provide customer information to credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business.</p>
