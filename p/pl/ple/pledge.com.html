<p><b>Our Commitment to Privacy</b><br>
The top priority of S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("SC 
Johnson") is to provide you with outstanding products. To achieve this goal, 
we must collect, maintain and use certain personal and financial information. 
SC Johnson has created this On-Line Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our 
respect for your privacy. This On-Line Privacy Policy describes the information 
we will collect and how we will use that information. It applies only to the on-line 
collection of data. Your privacy is important to SC Johnson and we want you to 
know about our on-line privacy policies and practices.</p>
        
<p><b>1. Information SC Johnson Collects On-Line</b><br>
SC Johnson gathers, retains and utilizes information about you to operate our 
business and to make our products, information and opportunities available to 
you. We collect this information when you provide it through voluntary registrations 
on several of our sites and in certain promotions, contests or sweepstakes. We 
will not collect personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, 
address, telephone number, social security number, billing and shipping information, 
credit card information or e-mail address) unless you have provided it to us voluntarily 
or we have obtained it from publicly available information or third parties with 
whom we conduct business. We shall only use the information for purposes for which 
it was collected and to send our visitors information about our company and our 
products. We also use it to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to 
help better understand the demographics of our audience.</p>
        
<p><b>2. Visitor Tracking</b><br>
We sometimes collect anonymous information through the use of various technologies, 
possibly including one called "cookies," to help us provide better customer 
service. 
For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also 
measure visitor activity on SC Johnson Websites, but we do so in ways that keep 
the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes referred to 
as "clickstream data." SC Johnson or its analytic vendors may use this 
data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.</p>
        
<p> Also, when we collect personal data, we may extract some information and combine 
it with other information, such as clickstream data. This information is used 
and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. 
None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want 
your personal information used in this manner, you can opt-out by clicking on 
the link to our "Contact Us" page.</p>
        
<p> Cookies are small files that a Website installs on your hard drive. Cookies 
enable our Web server to recognize your computer. This allows a company to tailor 
its Websites to better match your interests and preferences. Information gathered 
through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the 
pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the Websites visited just before 
and just after its Website.</p>
        
<p> You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving 
you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to 
block cookies altogether. However, if you do so, your ability to use the Website 
may be impaired.</p>
        
<p> Most browsers also allow you to erase cookies already stored.</p>
        
<p><b>3. Use and Sharing of the Information</b><br>
We do not give or sell your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated 
organizations for their independent use without your consent. We may share your 
information with agents and/or contractors of SC Johnson in connection with services 
they perform for us. As an example, we use personal information for purposes of 
administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available 
other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. We may 
store and process personally identifiable information to better understand your 
needs and how we may improve our products and services. We may use your information 
to contact you in the future about important changes, such as about our Websites, 
new services and products, promotions, sweepstakes and special offers.</p>
        
<p><b>4. Policy on Correcting, Updating or Deleting Information</b><br>
If you would like to correct, update or delete personal information retained by 
us, or inform us of your desire not to receive future communications from us, 
please click on a link to our "Contact Us" page. </p>
        
<p><b>5. Security </b><br>
SC Johnson will take reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable 
information from loss, theft, misuse or alteration. If we ask you to send credit 
card information to us on our Websites, a secure server software will encrypt 
such information before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route 
and decoded once it reaches our Website. Other email that you send to us may not 
be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to 
your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send 
your Social Security or credit card numbers to us through an unsecured email.</p>
        
<p><b>6. Children</b><br>
SC Johnson has no intention of collecting personally identifiable information 
from children under the age of thirteen (13). This Website is not intended for 
children under the age of 13 and there is no reason to suspect that the Website 
is designed in a manner that would attract such children. If you are under the 
age of thirteen (13), please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever. 
If a child provides us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian 
of that child may contact us if they would like this information deleted from 
our records.</p>
        <p><b>7. Links</b><br>
<b>The S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. sites contain links to other websites. S. C. 
Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
of such websites</b>.</p>
        
<p><b>8. Your Consent</b><br>
By using our Websites you consent to our collection and use of your personally 
identifiable information as described in the On-Line Privacy Policy. SC Johnson 
reserves the right to change or update this On-Line Privacy Policy, or any other 
SC Johnson policy or practice, at any time. If we change our on-line privacy policies 
and procedures, we will post those changes on our Website to keep you aware of 
what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may 
disclose it. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting 
to the Websites. Thank you for visiting us. We value your patronage.<br><br>
