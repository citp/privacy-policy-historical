#### 3\. Why do we collect this information?

We collect the personally identifiable information in order to serve the needs of our visitors and customers. If you are purchasing a product from us and supply us with credit card information, we need to know who you are in order to verify the credit card information you have sent us. The non-personal information that we collect from you is used for internal purposes to make your experience with our site more enjoyable.

#### 4\. How is your information protected?

We use the latest in encryption technology to ensure that any sensitive information that is sent to you by us via the Internet is protected from unauthorized interception. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods.
