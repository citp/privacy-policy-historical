### Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [info@plough.com](mailto:info@plough.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20inquiry) or write us at: The Plough Publishing House, 151 Bowne Drive, PO Box 398, Walden, NY 12586. 

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to our Website. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether you intend for these signals to be transmitted. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals.

We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like comment threads. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention by others of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
