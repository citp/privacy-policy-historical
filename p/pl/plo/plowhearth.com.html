					At Plow &amp; Hearth, we recognize and respect the importance of maintaining the privacy of our customers and registered users (members).  This Privacy Policy describes why we gather customer and member information, what information we collect, how we collect it, what we use the information for and how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information. This Privacy Policy is part of the <a href="/security/termsofuse.asp">Terms of Use</a>, which governs your use of PLOWHEARTH.COM.<br><br>
					<span class="custText"><b>Note:</b></span><em>You must be 18 years or older to register as a member of www.plowhearth.com.</em><br><br>

					<b>Why do we gather information?</b><br>
					Since our inception, Plow &amp; Hearth has consistently provided our customers with quality goods and excellent customer service. We gather personal information to allow us to process your orders, to enhance and personalize your shopping experience and to inform you of special offers and discounts.  <br><br>

					<b>What information do we gather?</b><br>
					When you order from our Web site, we collect the following information: your name, telephone number, email address, billing information (credit card number, expiration date and billing address), products purchased, any relevant promotion code and information (frequent flyer miles, for example) and, if relevant, the recipient's name, address and telephone number. Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order. Also, if you register as a member, we request your name, address, phone number, email address, title (gender), and other information set forth on the <a href="../myshop/register.asp">Member Registration</a> Page. Members may also add to their Address Book the name, address and telephone number of friends or other persons to whom they may wish to send gifts or receive gift reminders. Only Members have the right to view and edit their Address Book entries. <br><br>

					<b>How we use "cookies"?</b><br>
					A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a Web site that gives you a numeric user ID and stores certain information about your activity on the site. We use cookies to let us know if you are a previous customer and also to provide certain features to you, such as storing information on your product selections as you shop on our site.   We do not store any personal or financial information about you (except your name) using cookies. <br><br>
					Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, and most also allow you to instruct your browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature certain aspects of www.plowhearth.com, such as the shopping basket, will not function properly.<br><br>

				<b>How we use the information we collect about you?</b><br>
					We use information we collect from you to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you of offers and discounts from Plow &amp; Hearth, or other sites and companies owned by our parent company, 1800Flowers.com, including HearthSong and Magic Cabin Dolls. In addition, we periodically make such information, including aggregated information, available to selected third parties including but not limited to, those who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes.
