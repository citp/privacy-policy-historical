**This Website policy is effective 01/01/2011 and may be amended from time to time**.

We respect the privacy of our customers and are committed to protecting their information on our Web sites with the same care we utilize for all PNC transactions.

PNC does not automatically collect personal information from visitors to its Web sites. PNC does use tools, such as cookies or click stream auditing, for our own internal uses, such as recommending products and services and gathering Web analytics. Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site stores on a visitor's Web browser to remind the site about the visitor the next time they visit the site. PNC does not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies. PNC uses cookies to enhance our customers' online banking session by making navigation easier and providing important security features. For certain applications, such as Online Banking, cookies are a requirement because they help protect the privacy of a customer's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the customer forgets to log out. Click stream auditing includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed or acted upon by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and when a web surfer has responded to an advertisement. We may occasionally combine this information with individual information on an aggregate level to determine the effectiveness of our advertising.

Cookies cannot be used to capture your e-mail address, obtain data from your hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about you. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. Some Web sites, however, use cookies to obtain information from your browser. You can set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, so that you can control whether you accept or reject a cookie. Please click on [Controlling Cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20121228102352id_/https%3A//www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Solutions.do%3FsiteArea%3D/PNC/Solutions.do?siteArea=/pnccorp/PNC/Privacy+Policy/Controlling+Cookies) for more information.

We use third party advertising and media companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. Through the use of cookies and Action Tags (commonly referred to as Web beacons or GIF tags), which are inserted in various places within our Web site, such third party companies may collect anonymous information about your visits to the PNC site and your interaction with our ads and content. For instance, they may keep track of how many of our ads you had seen on other web sites before visiting our Web site. These third party companies have a network of advertising companies, such as PNC, and may share such anonymous information about your visits to pnc.com and other Web sites with us, and may use it in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you and which would be relevant to you, based on your browsing on pnc.com. From time to time, we may also share anonymous information with such third party companies in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our Web site. If you would like more information about the use of third-party cookies and tags, or the process of opting out of such cookies or tags, please go to [http://atlassolutions.com/privacy-policy](http://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/externalPopup.app?page=http://atlassolutions.com/privacy-policy), or [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/externalPopup.app?page=http://www.networkadvertising.org).
