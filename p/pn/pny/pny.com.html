                    of your Personal Information, and honors your choices for 
                    its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, 
                    misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or 
                    destruction both online and off-line. To the extent that you 
                    are asked to enter sensitive information (such as credit card 
                    number) online at the Site, that information is protected 
                    from access by any third parties using commercial practices 
                    prevalent within the online industry (e.g., Secure Sockets 
                    Layer ("SSL") technology). When such security technology is 
                    used, depending on your browser software, you will be notified 
                    by various means such as by the "lock" icon located at the
