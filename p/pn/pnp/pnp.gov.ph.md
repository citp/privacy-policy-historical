Information Collected and Stored Automatically   
If you visit our site to read or download information, we automatically collect and store only the following information about you. 

  * The name of the domain (for example,"xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you are connecting from a university's domain) and IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are using the Internet) from which you access our website; 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
  * The date and time you access our site; 
  * The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site; and

  * This information is primarily collected for statistical analysis. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. In certain circumstances, however, we may take additional steps to identify you based on this information and we may share this information, including your identity, with other government agencies. 

Information Collected from E-Mail   
If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail containing personal information:   
You may volunteer to provide us personally-identifying information, for example your mailing address, in an electronic mail message. Before you do so, you should know that the material you submit may be seen by various people. We may enter the information into a database and we may share it with other government agencies. Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive or includes personal information, you may want to send it in by postal mail instead. Information collected in this manner may be used for responding to requests for information as well as other authorized purposes. 

Security, Intrusion, and Detection   
For site security purposes, and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, all network traffic is monitored in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage or conduct criminal activity. To protect the system from unauthorized use and to ensure that the system is functioning properly, individuals using this computer system are subject to having all of their activities monitored and recorded by personnel authorized to do so by the PNP (and such monitoring and recording will be conducted). Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, system personnel may provide the results of such monitoring to appropriate officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to this service, are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under Philippine law.
