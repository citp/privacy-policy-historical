Any personal information collected as part of the event will only be collected and used for purposes of the event, such as to notify the winners and award prizes for a promotion or contest, and as otherwise set forth as part of the survey, promotion, or contest. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the obandiproductions Sites.</span>

			<span class="c2">Cookies Information. When you visit the Sites or use our Services, one or more cookies, web beacons, or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use.

Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the web site or using the service.

We also use the information collected and stored by cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences when using our Services in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c2">We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates.

However, some features and services may not function properly without cookies.</span>

Some of these third party advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and subject to the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Preference Marketing by Network Advertisers, available atwww.networkadvertising.org (the "NAI Principles"). If you would like to opt-out from these services from NAI members, you may go to the NAI Non-PII Opt-Out Page, located at </span><span class="c2 c8"><a class="c5" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a></span><span class="c2">, or the opt-out page of the particular third party advertising network identified in the cookie.</span>

			<span class="c2">In general, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise trade your personally identifiable information ("PII") with third parties. However, we do share your PII with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example, sharing of your PII may take place under the following limited circumstances:</span>

Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis, and marketing research that may require access to or use of your personal information.

		</p>
		<p class="c3">
			<span class="c4">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Business Transfers. Information about our users and the access and use of the obandiproductions Sites and our products and services is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including PII, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide our products and services, and the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which PII would be transferred as one of the business assets.</span>

In general, clicking on third party links on the Sites, whether part of a search result, advertisement, or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link, or content to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you click on a link or visit a Third Party Property or otherwise leave our Sites, to review any such third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their web site, products, or services.</span>
