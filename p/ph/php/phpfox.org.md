To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Our Commitment to Children's Privacy 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information 

You can access all of your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by a secure login into the [account area](http://www.phpfox.org/user/setting/) .   
If for some reason you cannot login or have lost your password you can use the "lost password" tool.   
If that process has failed you may then contact us and to protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.   
There is a security limit of 1 request per 7 days to protect your privacy.
