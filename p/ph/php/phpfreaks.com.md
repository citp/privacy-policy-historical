This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site
  * The date and time you access our site

We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.



If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an e-mail, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our website -- we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. Any information submitted in these fashions is considered suitable for public consumption, and will occasionally be posted to various locations on phpfreaks.com.
