                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Pheed Limited operates the Pheed website (the "Site") and related mobile applications and software (collectively with the Site, the "Service"). A premium service that enables people to subscribe to a particular ‘news feed’ and link to someone’s real life, in real time. Offering a selection of premium text, photo, voice note, audio content, video, link and other content (collectively, the “Content”). Pheed is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. To that end, we have prepared this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to describe our information gathering and dissemination practices and our data protection practices for the Service. The terms "Pheed," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Pheed Limited and its subsidiaries. The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the user/customer utilizing the Service.

Any person who provides information to us through registration or in any other manner on the Site or the Service represents to Pheed that they are 13 years of age or older. If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal information to us, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Information</strong><br>

We endeavor to limit our requests for Personally Identifiable Information to information we believe is reasonably necessary to achieve our purposes as described in the "Information Use" section below. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Service's features. Any Personally Identifiable Information received in communication or in material you transmit to Pheed by electronic mail or otherwise are and will be treated in accordance with our privacy policy.
</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>

<li>to keep you up to date on the latest Service announcements, special offers, or other information we think you would like to hear about either from us or from our partners.</li>
<li>if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by law, in connection with litigation, to prevent a crime, or to protect personal safety, the public, or the Service.</li>
<li>in connection with a sale of stock or assets, reorganization, consolidation, merger with another entity, or if Pheed should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to another entity.</li>
