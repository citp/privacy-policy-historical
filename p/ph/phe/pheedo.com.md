  Privacy Policy 

**Personally Identifiable Client Data**   
Pheedo, Inc. collects personally identifiable information from all websites (and specifically their owners) wishing to join our network. The collection of this information is a part of normal business practices. Clients wishing to join the Pheedo, Inc. advertising network will be asked to provide personally identifiable data through the host sign up and registration process at our web site. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and social security number, tax ID number, etc. Pheedo, Inc. will never request or collect data from a client on subject areas including sexual orientation, political or religious affiliations, or medical data. 

Pheedo, Inc. does not use any personally identifiable data about a client for profiling purposes. All personally identifiable information that Pheedo, Inc. collects from clients is principally intended for administrative needs (e.g., accounting and pay-out), for which purpose such data are required. 

Periodically Pheedo, Inc. may desire to communicate with our network of hosts via email newsletters or other avenues to offer strategic marketing information and other communications to assist in business related activities. In such instances Pheedo, Inc. will access clients' personally identifiable information. In the event that a client of Pheedo, Inc. wishes not to have their personally identifiable information used for the aforementioned purposes, those clients can elect to opt-out from future communications. For more information on opting-out please see the "Client Choice Concerning Data Collection" section below. 

All personally identifiable data provided by individual clients will be kept in strict confidence by Pheedo, Inc. and will be treated with the same level of respect and care that Pheedo, Inc. treats its other proprietary information and trade secrets. Pheedo, Inc. will never sell, rent, exchange or barter any personally identifiable client information to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing purposes. Pheedo, Inc. may, from time to time, provide such information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and payouts. Any third-party vendor so used, will be required to enter into a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with Pheedo, Inc. in accordance with the policies stated here. 

**Personally Identifiable Client Data - Opt-Out**   
Because Pheedo, Inc. is a strong proponent of online privacy we are committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all clients before any personally identifiable data are used for any purposes other than for what was originally intended. 

When a client joins Pheedo, Inc.'s network and registers for Pheedo, Inc.'s services, personally identifiable information is required as a part of doing business. Pheedo, Inc.'s primary intent in collecting personally identifiable information is for use in administrative purposes including accounting and payouts. However, Pheedo, Inc. may periodically use personally identifiable information for marketing and communication purposes targeted to our clients. Clients wishing not to receive such communications from Pheedo, Inc. may do so by "opting-out" during the registration and application procedure process. A client may change their "opt" status at anytime during their tenure with Pheedo, Inc. by accessing their online account.

**"Cookies"** When a Pheedo Client logs in to the Pheedo reporting systems, a "cookie" is placed within their computer. A "cookie" is a unique tag that is issued to the Client and is used to identify individual computers. The purpose of the cookie is to allow Pheedo to validate the identity of the Client and maintain the security and privacy of the Client's account data. This cookie is required to log into Pheedo's reporting systems and there is no method to opt out of this cookie. 

**Security Precautions**   
Pheedo, Inc. makes every effort to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. Any data that is stored on Pheedo, Inc.'s server is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. Pheedo, Inc. has a strict internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering Pheedo, Inc. products and services. 

**Access to Data  
**Pheedo, Inc. allows clients who have provided personally identifiable data, access their data to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes at anytime through their Pheedo customer online account. 

**Pheedo and Client Website Privacy Policy Statements**   
Pheedo, Inc. encourages all websites within our network create privacy policy statements and provide Internet consumers with conspicuous access to their statements. Additionally, Pheedo, Inc. requests that all website publishers doing business with Pheedo, Inc. disclose any and all information that is being collected from Internet consumers on their website, including data gathered from banners and other forms of advertising being served on their website. Finally, Pheedo, Inc. encourages the websites in our network to provide links to all advertisers gathering information from Internet consumers in their respective privacy statements. 

If you have particular concerns about any website advertising with Pheedo, Inc. with respect to privacy issues, please contact [privacy@pheedo.com](mailto:privacy@pheedo.com). 

**Children's Privacy  
**As of April 21, 2000 the children's Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. Pheedo, Inc. is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Pheedo, Inc.'s web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to do business with us.

We also request that all websites using our advertising network disclose in their privacy statements any and all information regarding the collection of information from children.
