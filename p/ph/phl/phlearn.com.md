## **Information We Share with Third Parties**

PHLEARN collects data that is critical to the function of our Services and delivering the best experience possible. As a general rule, we will not share or otherwise disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the following circumstances: 1) Under a confidentiality agreement, we may match user information with third-party data. 2) We may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, we have customers in 148 countries) in order to describe our Services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

## **Sharing by You**

You will have the ability to share your User Content with another user(s). If you share your User Content with anyone, we shall have no liability to you (or anyone you share your User Content). We will not make any User Content that you keep private and do no share available to any third party except to a third party authorized by you to access such information or if the law requires.

**Information You Generate, Submit and/or Post**

You are solely responsible for the information you generate, submit and/or post on our website using our Services (as outlined in our Terms and Conditions of Use). PHLEARN assumes no liability for the information you generate, submit and/or post on our website using our Services.

## **Accessing Your Personal Information**

You may edit your personal account information with PHLEARN at any time by using your unique identifier and password and accessing your [Account](https://phlearn.com/my-phlearn/account/) page.

You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information. You can contact us in order to update or correct your personally identifiable information. You may change your communications preferences as to what you receive from us. You may request the deletion of personally identifiable information about you on our systems, but only subject to the following condition: you must cancel your PHLEARN PRO Subscription (if applicable) and delete your entire account. Keep in mind, any updates, corrections, and deletions will have no effect on other information PHLEARN maintains or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, or deletion. In order to request personal information or account changes, you will be asked to verify your identity.

Please be aware that it is not possible to remove every record of the information you have provided to us from all of our systems. For security reasons, the secure backups of our system’s information to prevent data loss will mean that a copy of your information may still exist in some form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate or delete. After receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively own and control will be updated, corrected, or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically possible.

## **Protecting Your Information**

Your personal account information with PHLEARN is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information and the User Content therein. We recommend that you do not disclose your unique identifier or password to anyone. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished using our Services. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information or User Content.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online Services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

## **Communications**

We may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.

For example, PHLEARN sends welcome e-mail after you create an account, when you signup for our newsletter, when you enter a contest on our website, and when you purchase any product on our website. We also may send other e-mail related to the website and your account, such as product announcements, changes in your account, and changes to our company policies. We give you the option to unsubscribe in the emails we send you.

PHLEARN requires that these third parties agree to protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing the products or services as contracted or required by law.

## **Compliance With Laws**

PHLEARN may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or another valid legal process.
