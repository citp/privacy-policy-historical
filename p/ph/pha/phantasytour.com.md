# Phantasy Tour

## How is the information that I provide in my user account used?

At a minimum, a Phantasy Tour user account consists of a username, password, first name, last name, and e-mail address. This information is required to create an account. This information will never be shared with or sold to anyone without your expressed permission. It is used solely by this web site for the purposes of identifying you on repeat visits and within standings and leagues. You have the option to add additional information about you in your user account, including street address, city, state, country, home page URL, tape list URL, birth date and gender. Whenever your username appears on the site, for example in your league's roster or within the standings, other Phantasy Tour visitors may have the option to click on your username for more information about you. You are in complete control of what information is shared with other visitors of the site through the use of user preferences. Through the user preferences feature, you have the option to turn on or off the sharing of the following information:

  * Real Name (first name, last name)
  * Internet Addresses (e-mail address, internet URL's)
  * Personal Information (gender, birth date)
  * Street Address
  * Location (city, state)



The option to add and display this information is provided simply as a service to user's who use this web site as a forum to meet other people of similar interests. Some of the information may be required to use new features at Phantasy Tour as they become available. For example, in the future, you may be able to purchase goods through Phantasy Tour and would thus need to provide a mailing address for the delivery of these goods. If you choose to turn off all information sharing, only your username will be used to identify you throughout the site.

## Does Phantasy Tour collect any information automatically and how is that information used?

At the current time, the only information that is collected automatically upon a visit to Phantasy Tour is purely of an aggregated, statistical nature. This information is used to analyze traffic patterns on the site and referral information. No information that personally identifies a specific visitor is collected.

## Does Phantasy Tour use cookies and if so, how?

Phantasy Tour does use cookies to help identify a user for the duration of a visit to the site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are placed on the user's computer in order to assist the site in identifying that user. With the help of cookies, a user is asked to log into the site only once per session. After a session ends (i.e. the browser window in closed) or the user elects to logout using the link on the home page, the cookie is destroyed. This is why the user is asked to log in again with each new visit. This protects the user from someone accessing their account from a computer that they have used previously. Cookies are used only as a convience feature for the user and are not used to collect personal or session information from the user or their computer.

Phantasy Tour may change this Privacy Statement without notice from time to time. Please visit this page often for updates and changes.
