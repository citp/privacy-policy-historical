Where we use your information for our legitimate interests, we make sure that we take into account any potential impact of such use on you. Our legitimate interests don’t automatically override yours and we won’t use your information if we believe that your interests should override ours unless we have other grounds to do so (such as your consent or a legal obligation).

**WHO CAN SEE YOUR INFORMATION**

Our staff or the staff of third party service providers may process your information on our behalf. Processing can mean any activity that involves the use of information about someone that can identify them. All uses of your information - for example, obtaining, recording, storing, disclosing, organising, retrieving, deleting and destroying - are types of data processing.

We take measures to ensure that third parties who process your information on our behalf are acting lawfully in accordance with our instructions and are subject to appropriate confidentiality requirements. We also have adequate technical and organisational safeguards in our company and with third party processors to protect your information.

**WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

We share your information within the companies that make up the Phaidon group of companies. Where we share your information outside our group of companies, we will ask you to consent to a third party sharing your information and if you choose to give your permission any interaction you have with a third party is governed by their privacy terms. The third party becomes a joint data controller of your information with us. This means that the third party can make decisions about how to use your information. Before we share your information, we require third parties to enter into a data sharing agreement which stipulates that they must maintain appropriate security to protect your information from unauthorised access, processing or use. We will share your information with the following third parties: • selected publishing partners and authors; • selected marketing partners; • any prospective seller or buyer of businesses or assets, only if we decide to acquire, transfer or sell any business or assets; • any other third parties (including legal or other advisors, regulatory authorities, courts and government agencies) where necessary to enable us to enforce our legal rights, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our employees or where such disclosure may be permitted or required by law or where we have a legal obligation to do so.

**HOW LONG WE KEEP IT FOR**

We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or for as long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our legitimate interests. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it.

For example: • we archive our email and paper correspondence regularly and destroy unnecessary information; • we operate a best practice email retention policy requiring password protected folders and departmental shared drives to provide restricted access to information; • we auto-delete emails periodically; • we conduct regular access reviews to keep access profiles and policies up to date; • we conduct periodic review and purge cycles of documents in accordance with our document retention policy; • we retain information relating to orders, refunds and customer queries for approximately 7 years; • we retain information relating to commercial contracts for approximately 7 years after expiration or termination whichever is the sooner; • we maintain a suppression list of email addresses of individuals who no longer wish to be contacted by us. So that we can comply with their wishes we must store this information permanently; • we delete information collected through marketing channels 2 years after our last interaction with you; • we destroy CVs and related information from job applicants who have not been shortlisted for interview once the recruitment process is complete.
