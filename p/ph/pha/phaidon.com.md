# Privacy Policy

Phaidon Press Limited ("Phaidon") takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy describes how we will use and why we obtain, store and process data which can identify you. 

We may update this policy from time to time and will indicate on Phaidon.com and other websites operated by Phaidon (collectively, "Phaidon Websites") when changes have been made. 

By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by this policy.

  
**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

Information is collected from you when you register with us, or when you contribute to or use some of the features on the Phaidon Websites. The information we collect is clearly set out on the web page on which we collect it. In addition, we may collect your IP address and/or use cookies to identify you and track your activity (unless you configure your web browser not to accept them, in which case you may not be able to use this website).

  
**WHY WE COLLECT IT**

We collect information about you so that we and our service providers can personalise your use of the Phaidon Websites, assist your use of the Phaidon Websites and improve the Phaidon Websites generally. Depending upon your responses to our data protection questions we may arrange for you to be sent information about related products and services from us. You may update the answers to your questions at any time by logging into your account and changing your preferences.

  
**WHO WE DISCLOSE IT TO**

• We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed to aggregate information) to third parties as is necessary to facilitate the performance of services requested by you or with your prior consent.   
• We may pass your contact details to third parties who may then occasionally send communications to you to provide information, offers and services that may be of interest to you.   
• In certain circumstances we may need to disclose information about you if you breach this privacy policy or if you breach the Terms. We may also disclose or access your account if required to do so by law or by any Governmental body. 

  
**DATA PROTECTION**

Phaidon Press Limited is registered with the Information Commissioner in the UK as a “data controller” in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Further details of the registration are available at [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/).

  
**SECURITY**

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us and certain sections of the Phaidon Websites may encrypt data using secure server software (SSL) or a comparable standard. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.

  
**AUTOMATED DECISIONS**

Parts of the Phaidon Websites and our billing process (which is transacted via Datacash) are automatic and we may process your personal data as part of the Phaidon Websites and the billing process.

  
**ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We will always let you have a copy of personal information we have about you, should you request it, and you may correct it if you wish. To access the data we hold on you simply login to your account where you can view your username, password, orders and personal settings.

  
**THIRD PARTY LINKS**

We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our website and we recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.

  
**TRANSFERRING YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF EUROPE**

As part of the services we offer to you through this website, the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the EU. By way of example, this may happen if any of our services or any of our service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EU, or in order to provide you with services whilst you are personally outside the EU. In all such instances we will take steps with the aim of ensuring your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this privacy policy.

  
**QUESTIONS?**

If you have any questions or complaints relating to this Privacy Policy or how we use the personal information we have about you, please contact [webinfo@phaidon.com](mailto:webinfo@phaidon.com). We will endeavour to respond to you promptly.
