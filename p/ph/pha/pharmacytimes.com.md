# Pharmacy Times - Practical Information for Today's Pharmacist

### HCPLive Privacy Policy Statement

The privacy of our users on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because HCPLive and its network of sites, including but not limited to, MDNG (www.mdnglive.com), Physician�s Money Digest (www.PMDLive.com ), American Journal of Managed Care (www.AJMC.com), Pharmacy Times (www.PharmacyTimes.com), and Oncology & Biotech News (www.OBTNLive.com) do gather certain types of information about our users, we feel that you should completely understand the conditions and terms surrounding the gathering and use of information about those using our sites and services. This Privacy Policy Statement divulges what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. In the policy, the pronouns "you" and "your" are used to refer to the end user, while "we," "us" and "our" are used to refer to HCPLive.

By visiting HCPLive or one of its network sites, or by using one of its services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy Statement. We may amend this Statement at any time; if we make changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. This Statement was last revised on January 1, 2009. Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy Statement should be directed to HCPLive (info@HCPLive.com) for clarification and further elaboration.

**1\. Collecting Information**

HCPLive gathers and tracks information/data that users provide through registration on our sites for some services. In addition to this gathering of information by the registration of users, HCPLive also gathers information through tracking systems depending on the service being used by you. The tracking systems include deriving data by tallying page views throughout our sites and capturing information on the type of browser being used to view the site, tracking what pages you have visited while on the site and in market research studies tracking what computers respond to a survey. This information enables us to better provide content and to respond to our users' needs. It also is used to help our advertisers and sponsors to better understand the demographics of our audience (solely on an aggregate basis). As HCPLive derives its revenue mainly from advertising on our sites, it is necessary for us to provide such aggregated demographic data to our sponsors and advertisers; this allows us to keep our services free to you. HCPLive does not divulge any personal information about an individual user to any third party except in the case of a market research study where your identity or an identifier unique to you may be disclosed but will not be linked to the answers you provided.

HCPLive may gather information on our users in the following ways:

* Registration

Some HCPLive services require user registration. For the registration process, HCPLive may require some information, like name, e-mail address, and profession, while other information requested will be voluntary and optional. Information collected in the registration process is never shared with third parties in a personally identifiable way.

* eDigests

All the sites in the HCPLive network offer free eDigests to users, providing specific information to them on the appropriate topics. To provide this service, HCPLive must gather the e-mail addresses of users who register for and voluntarily subscribe to said service. You may remove yourself from an HCPLive mailing list at any time by following the instructions provided at the end of every eDigest.

* IntelliPol

Users of HCPLive may elect to participate in IntelliPolls that the company runs from time to time. These studies are intended to give specific anonymous feedback to third parties. This feedback while shared in the format it was collected will not be shared in manner that is correlated to your personally identifiable information used to pay honoraria for your time. All participants may be disclosed to such third parties by a unique identifier but such identifier will not be associated with any specific feedback.

* Usage Tracking

HCPLive uses traffic analysis software on our servers to track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. HCPLive uses this data to break down overall usage statistics according to IP address, domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the data automatically sent by the browser whenever a web page is requested.

* Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that resides only on your own computer and that can be accessed only by the server that originally created the cookie. A cookie cannot store or send back any information to HCPLive that you have not specifically and voluntarily provided while on an HCPLive site, or that is not among the information mentioned above that is contained in every user's browser (i.e., domain name, browser type). We use cookies only so that we may tally the number of unique users who visit our sites, and potentially to permit greater personalization of the site to your preferences and specifications. Even when you may have provided to HCPLive information that is stored in a cookie on your computer, HCPLive will not share personally identifiable information about you to third parties.

**2\. Sharing of the information**

HCPLive uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs, help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics and help ensure the integrity of market research studies. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information about an individual user�s identity with any third party except (a) as noted above to the extent you have voluntarily agreed to participate in a market research study or (b) as necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements.

Please note that HCPLive does not control the practices of the advertisers on their sites. When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy statement whenever interacting with any web site. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click their ad, visit their site, and view their content, please contact them directly.

**3\. "No-spam" policy**

Your e-mail address will not be sold to a third party if you sign up for one of our HCPLive eDigests, IntelliPolls, or register for our site. If you sign up for an eDigest at an HCPLive site, you will receive only the eDigest of the specialty you have requested. You may occasionally receive an offer from HCPLive to sign up for a new eDigest, specialty-specific information from one of our advertisers sent on behalf of HCPLive, or information about other HCPLive services, but you will not receive additional eDigests unless you specifically have requested them.

**4\. Delete/deactivate policy**

Users may unsubscribe to any of our eDigests or discussion lists at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every eDigest or discussion list, and also on the web site. If you no longer wish to use any HCPLive services or receive any information from HCPLive, you may request to have your personal information removed from HCPLive's databases by sending a request via e-mail (info@HCPLive.com) or by fax (609-716-4747), including your first and last names and e-mail address with which you originally registered. Changes or corrections to your information may be submitted in the same fashion.

**5\. Opt-in List Privacy Policy**

When you register for HCPLive services by giving us your e-mail address, you are joining an opt-in list, which means you will receive information or participate in campaigns relevant to the specialty you selected, whether it is sent directly by us or sent by us on behalf of our advertisers. You may have your e-mail address removed from the HCPLive opt-in lists at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained at the end of the e-mail you receive.
