# Pharmacy Times: ASCEND MEDIA WEB PRIVACY POLICY

Your privacy is vital to us at Ascend Media.  Ascend Media recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites, subscribers to our magazines, registrants for our events, recipients of our e-mail newsletters and all of our customers.  Because of this, we have provided this detailed policy statement about privacy and information dissemination practices related to Ascend Media.  Of course, our site visitors may enjoy many of our features and activities without providing any personal information.

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

Ascend Media collects information from our web sites users and subscribers. The following section describes the type of information collected and how we use it to provide services to our customers. 

**Registration and Ordering**

When you register for one of our products (subscription forms, site memberships, trade show attendance, newsletter subscriptions, etc.), our forms may ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number) or demographic information (such as job title, purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional certification).  This information is used to send news about our products or promotional material from other carefully screened businesses.  In addition, demographic information may be used to customize the display of our sites to you by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to your past visits.  If mailings are sent to you, in all instances you will have the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving the mailings.

For our services that require payment (such as certain events, products and subscriptions), we also collect credit card information (such as account name, number and expiration date), which is used for billing purposes only, and is not disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party.  Additionally, information collected for show directories is used to create show books only and is not shared with any outside parties.

**E-mail Newsletters**

If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information.  We use this information in the same manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process described above.  Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter.

**Communications with Us**

We have features where users can submit information to us (such as our feedback forms).  Letters to the editor and similar submissions may be made public.  Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request.  We may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes and to help us to serve customers better.  Ascend Media periodically sends promotional e-mails to its subscribers about services offered by Ascend Media and its partners.  If you do not wish to receive this information from Ascend Media or its partners, please let us know by visiting this web site at [removemyinfo.com](http://www.removemyinfo.com/) or writing us at Ascend Media, Inc., 11600 College Blvd., Overland Park, KS 66210.

**Cookies**

Ascend Media web sites offer so-called "cookies" which store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best.  When you re-visit our sites, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. Cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional information.  Our sites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function within your web browser.

Additionally, some of our business affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions.  However, we have no access to or control over these business affiliates' cookies and we urge users to read their respective privacy policies for information on how they use cookies.

**WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED**

From time to time we share this contact or demographic information with other reputable organizations for marketing purposes, or the information is used by Ascend Media to contact consumers for its own marketing endeavors.  As a valued consumer, we offer you the opportunity to "opt out," or request not to accept these marketing opportunities. If at any time you change your mind and do not want Ascend Media to share your e-mail address or home address with other companies and/or organizations, or would simply like to be removed from the list, please let us know by visiting this web site at removemyinfo.com or writing us at Ascend Media, Inc., 11600 College Blvd., Overland Park, KS 66210.
