##  Privacy Policy

Pharmacy2U is registered under the Data Protection Act, Registration No. Z714211X. At Pharmacy2U we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to ensure you receive a personalised experience of the services you have requested from us. In order to provide the best service we can we need to collect and store information about you and the services we have provided to you.

**What information do we collect and store?**

  * When you buy goods or services from us we will collect and store certain personal information to allow us to process and fulfil your orders and to notify you of your order status.
  

  * We will ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order such as a product recall. 
  

  * For customers ordering pharmacy only medicines from this website we will ask for additional information to ensure that our pharmacists can check that the medicine is suitable for you to use. 
  

  * For patients who wish to use our NHS Prescription service we will need to know whether you pay for your NHS prescriptions and if not the reason that you are exempt from payment. Additionally, we will collect information about your existing medical conditions and any prescription medication that are prescribed for you by your doctor.
  

  * We will collect and store details of all medicines and other products we supply to you, and also all medicines that you or your doctor tell us you may be supplied on repeat prescription.
  

**How do we use it?**

  * We may occasionally use the information we collect to notify you about important functionality changes on the web site and Pharmacy2U promotions we think you'll find valuable. You may notify us that you do not wish to receive this promotional information at registration, or at any time by following the instructions on the emails you receive.
  

  * We will use the information to look after your healthcare as best we can, and that may mean us contacting you in certain circumstances that are relevant to your ongoing care.
  

**Will Pharmacy2U disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

  * Occasionally we make details available to companies whose products or services we think may interest our customers. If you do not wish to receive such offers please login to your account and change the setting to indicate "No" for "Selected company data sharing". 
  * We may also disclose information to outside parties if we are required by law to do so. For example prescribers must be notified where a patient presents a repeat prescription and the pharmacist becomes aware of clinically significant issues arising in connection with that prescription. We are also permitted by law to disclose information where the public interest overrides the need to keep the information confidential. 
  * Anyone who receives information from us also has a legal duty to keep this information confidential, subject to recognised exceptions of the types listed above. 

  
**Your Consent**

  * By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of information you submit by Pharmacy2U for the purposes described above. If we decide to change our data protection policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, and how we use it. 

  
**Your Rights**

  * You have the right to confidentiality under the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the common law duty of confidence (the Disability Discrimination and the Race Relations Acts may also apply).
  * We also comply with the NHS Code of Practice on Confidentiality and pharmacists have a requirement under their professional Code of Ethics to keep records about you confidential, secure and accurate.
  * All of our staff contracts of employment contain a requirement to keep patient information confidential. 

  
**Your right to view your health record**

  * You have the right to ask for a copy of all the information we store about you. 
  * There may be a charge to have a printed copy of the information held about you. Your request must be made in writing to Pharmacy2U. We are required to respond to your request within 40 days. 
  * You will need to give adequate information in order for pharmacy staff to identify you (for example, full name, address and date of birth). You will be required to provide ID, for example a passport, full driving license or credit/debit card before any information is released to you. 
  * If you think any information we hold on you is inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know.

  
If you have any questions please feel free to contact **0113 265 0222** or email [enquiries@pharmacy2u.co.uk](mailto:enquiries@pharmacy2u.co.uk)
