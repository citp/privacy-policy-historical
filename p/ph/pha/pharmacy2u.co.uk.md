Funding details and charging policies   
  
Some patients can get free prescriptions under certain circumstances – please ask for leaflet HC11 (<http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/MedicinesPharmacyAndIndustry/Prescriptions/NHSCosts/fs/en>). Anyone who has to pay and gets more than 5 prescription items in 4 months, or 14 in 12 months, could save money with a pre-payment certificate (PPC). You can call **0845 850 0030** to buy one over the phone or to get more details. You can also apply by post – please ask for application form FP95 (or see <http://www.ppa.org.uk/ppa/ppc_intro.htm>).

As from 1 April 2006 the prescription charge is £6.65, a 4-month prepayment certificate costs £33.90 and a 12-month prepayment certificate costs £93.20. These charges are set annually by the Department of Health.

The prescription charge is a tax paid directly to the NHS. It is not received by the pharmacist and does not form part of any remuneration to the pharmacy for NHS pharmaceutical services. The average ingredient cost of a dispensed item is £10.80 and pharmacies receive an average return of £1.30 per dispensed item. Further information on the cost of drugs and appliances can be found in the Drug Tariff, available from The Stationery Office. The Prescription Pricing Authority ([www.ppa.org.uk](http://www.ppa.org.uk/)) produces the Drug Tariff monthly.

Some information in this class may not be released because it is confidential or commercial information or its release may be prejudicial to the conduct of the pharmacy’s affairs.
