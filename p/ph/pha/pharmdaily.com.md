**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection and use practices of Pharmdaily ("Pharmdaily") in connection with the Pharmdaily Web site (the "Web Site") and all associated Pharmdaily products and services (the "Pharmdaily Services").

**What Information We Collect/How We Use It**

We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your Pharmdaily membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).

We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened a Pharmdaily e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members.

  * to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  * to send you general and administrative information about your Pharmdaily membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and
