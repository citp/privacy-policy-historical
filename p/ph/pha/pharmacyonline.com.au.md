Personal information can include your name, e-mail address, credit card details, demographic information about you (such as your postcode and age) and any other information of a personal nature which you provide. While we strive to protect our user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.

### How do we keep your personal information secure?

We cannot guarantee, in every circumstance, the security of the personal information you provide on the website.  All incoming encrypted information is routed through our firewall, which serves as a gatekeeper for our system. Only data containing the correct authorisation is permitted past the firewall. Attempts to pass the firewall are constantly monitored for suspicious activity.

### How do we use IP Addresses and 'Cookies'?

We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and usage analysis of the website and to report aggregated information to its advertisers. We use 'cookies' to track how and when customers use this website. 'Cookies' are used to see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates are made to the website based on data collected by 'cookies' such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from the website, you won't be offered as many afterwards. If you'd prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the website, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

We also use aggregated information (which is information recorded in any form about more than one individual) where the identity of the individual is not known and cannot be inferred from the information. We may use aggregated information to describe our User base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other Users of our Website.

We work with third parties to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use Cookies and Pixel Tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some third-party ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our Website with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share any personal information with any of our ad server partners, media partners or ad networks without your authorization.
