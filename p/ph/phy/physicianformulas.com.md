# Privacy Policy – Advance Physician Formulas

## Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at Physician Formulas. Since our inception we have never shared, rented, or sold any customer information to any other party -- and never will.

When you submit personal information on our website we will protect your information both online and offline.

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it. For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited access, secured facilities. Physicianformulas.com employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures.

Physician Formulas takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no data transmitted over the internet or stored on a server can ever be 100% secured. Therefore, while we strive to protect your privacy and personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted or disclosed to us online. We are not responsible for the disclosure, destruction or theft of your personal information.

If you opted to register with us, you established a password for your account, in which case your online account information will be protected by your password. We suggest that you do not share or disclose your password to anyone. You are responsible for the confidentiality of your account and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and password. We suggest creating challenging passwords such as those with alphanumeric combinations.

Secure Ordering

When you submit personal information on our website, your information is protected both online and offline. We can only access your credit card (but not your actual credit card information) to issue credits, never for actual charges. Only you can produce a charge by placing an order in your password-protected account.

While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon of your web browser becomes locked. This indicates that the connection between your web browser and our web server is secured. While on a secure page, the 'http' on your browser changes to 'https'.

When you submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software which meets or exceeds industry standards - (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form which is hosted in a secure data facility, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
