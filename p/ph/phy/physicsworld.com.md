IOP will not sell, rent or share users’ contact details with such third parties. The relevant Websites are: physicsworld.com, nanotechweb.org, medicalphysicsweb.org and enrvironmentalresearchweb.org. 

It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but it is encouraged so that IOP can provide a more personalised experience. If a user chooses not to provide such information then they will not be able to access parts of this Website and/or will not be able to use all the services offered by this Website.
