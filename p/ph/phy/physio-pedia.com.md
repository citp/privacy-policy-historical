### 1.3 The Information Physiopedia Collects and How It Is Used

#### 1.3.1 General

The information Physiopedia collects is set out in this section 1.3. Failure to provide such information may mean that you are unable to receive the Physiopedia Services or register as an Editor. 

You do not need to register for a Physiopedia account in order to visit and use the Site, however, you must subscribe to use the Physiopedia Plus services and register to be a Physiopedia Editor. For these no-registration-required services Physiopedia collects the following information: 

**General:** You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our Site or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you apply for a Physiopedia account, subscribe to Physiopedia Plus, register for an online course or event, or other social media functions on our Site, [enter a competition, promotion or survey] and when you report a problem with our site. The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information, personal description and professional information. 

**Cookies** : The Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Site. This helps Physiopedia to provide you with a good experience when you browse the Site and also allows us to improve the Site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, see our Cookie Policy. 

**E-mail Messages** : Note that if you send an e-mail to Physiopedia we may retain those communications and your e-mail address in order to reply to your enquiries, fulfil your requests and to improve our services. 

**To the extent that you submit to us any personal data belonging to third parties, you warrant that you have the consent of that third party to submit such data to us, including for such uses described in this Privacy Policy.**

#### 1.3.2 Additional information collected from Editors

In order to contribute content to the Site you must register as a Physiopedia “Editor” (see the [Terms of Service](http://www.physio-pedia.com/Physiopedia:Terms_of_Service)). Physiopedia collects the non-personal information described above at Section 1.3.1 from Editors, and in addition, Physiopedia collects the following types of personal information from Editors for the following purposes (personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, e-mail address, home address, phone numbers, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information): 

**Information you provide** : When you register to become an Editor, Physiopedia asks you for certain personal information. Examples of such information include your full name, e-mail address, professional credentials and the profile information described below. We use the personal information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select, send you emails about Site maintenance and updates, and inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy. 

**Profile Information** : Editors must disclose in their public profiles their corporate and academic affiliations and they must disclose if they receive, or expect to receive, any form of compensation for the content they contribute to Physiopedia, or any compensation related to medicine, medical information, or products and services related to the body. This is standard practice in the medical field and those policies carry over to the Physiopedia community, and are meant to encourage a “neutral point of view” with respect to Physiopedia contributions. 

**Your IP Address** : In addition to your profile, you may also be identified in the Physiopedia system by your IP address, the numerical address of the location from which you are connecting to the Site. That IP address may be traceable specifically to your computer, or it may only be traceable to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use to access the Internet, depending on what type of connection you have. In either case, Physiopedia will have the ability to link your IP address to your contributions on the Site, which helps to prevent abuse and fraud. 

**Contributions** : When Editors submit content to the Site, that information becomes publicly available throughout the world via the Site, and each such “post” will be attached to the Editor’s profile. Our policy is to store this material indefinitely and to ensure that it is always publicly viewable. Removing content from a Physiopedia article does not permanently delete that content. This does not affect any of your rights under applicable law. The features of the Site permit anyone to retrieve a previous version of an article and, if requested, may allow people to see content that was previously deleted. If the article itself is deleted, a copy will permanently remain on the Physiopedia servers and be accessible by Physiopedia personnel (again, this does not affect any of your rights under applicable law). 

**Other Data** : In order to maintain an open and transparent community, certain other data on Editors is made public through “user contributions” lists and by other users, typically in aggregated form. Such data might include the times at which an Editor edited content on the Site and the number of edits they made. 

**Email** : Other Editors may send email to you through the Physiopedia service, however your email address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if their email to you is “bounced” back to them. Physiopedia may use Editors’ email address to communicate with them periodically. 

**Invitation emails** : You may choose to opt-out of Physiopedia invitation emails by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the invitation email. 

**Links** : Physiopedia may present links in a format that lets Physiopedia keep track of when these links are clicked. Physiopedia uses this information to improve the quality of Physiopedia services, to estimate traffic Physiopedia sends to third party sites, and to customise content and advertising. 

**Your contacts** : In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Physiopedia, you may enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by Physiopedia to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders. You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts on Physiopedia. All information entered as private will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Physiopedia network without your permission. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personal information. **If you enter the names and email addresses of any such third parties, you warrant that you have the consent of such third party to enter such personal data and thereby submit this to Physiopedia.**

### 1.4 Physiopedia Plus

In the unlikely event of Physiopedia’s bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, Physiopedia may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
