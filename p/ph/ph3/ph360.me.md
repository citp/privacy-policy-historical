This information can include your name, your email address, and the name and email address of the person you are referring our Services to. If you chose to allow PH360 to access your address book or contacts on your computer or mobile device, we will collect the contact information of the friends you select to enter the referral program. When you make referrals using a social network such as Facebook or Twitter it may also include information from your profile that is made available to PH360 when we connect to your social network to post the referral on your behalf. The information that PH360 is provided during this process varies depending on the social network and your privacy settings, but can include information such as your name, profile picture, network, gender, username, user ID, age range, language, country, friends lists or followers and any other information you have permitted the social network to share with third parties. Additionally, we and our third party partners who administer our referral program may use cookies to identify you and your referred friends and to monitor the success of our referral program.

###### **How We Use Personal Information**

###### PH360 collects Personal Information from you for all purposes necessary to ensure the regular operation of your account and/or availability of our Services. These include, among other things, providing you with our Services; improving our Services and/or offering new products or services to you; informing you about events; inviting you to participate in specific research projects, contacting you to obtain testimonials or for other promotional purposes; performing quality control activities; conducting other R&D; and conducting Our Research.

###### PH360 may provide your Personal Information to our third-party service providers, which are companies and people that help us provide, understand and improve our Services. For example, we may use service providers to help host our website, run our mobile application, send emails, implement our marketing campaigns, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, conduct surveys or polls, obtain testimonials, or otherwise help us run or improve our business. In all instances, our service providers act on PH360’s behalf and we require by contract that they protect the confidentiality of any information they receive from us.

###### We may access, or track your location-based information from your computer or mobile device while you are downloading or using our mobile application or Services for security or health information purposes.

###### **How We Use Phenotype and Self-Reported Information**

###### We use your Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information to provide you with PH360 Services, customize the user experience, and enhance our features. If you allow sharing, Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information may be displayed in other users’ accounts. Self-Reported Information is used to customize your user experience – for example, by adjusting reports of your Phenotype to account for your reported behaviors or environmental exposures.

###### By using PH360 you give consent to participate in Our Research. We may include your Phenotypical Information and Self-Reported Information in Aggregated Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information disclosed to third parties for the purpose of publication in a scientific journal. Our Research is intended to advance Phenotype knowledge and to create, commercialize, or undertake activities toward the practical applications of this learning to the improvement of health care. Towards the same goals, we may allow research contractors to access your individual-level Phenotypical and/or Self-Reported Information onsite at PH360’s offices for the purpose of conducting scientific research, provided that all such research contractors will be supervised by PH360 and subject to PH360’s access rules and guidelines. We may provide your individual-level Phenotypical Information and/or Self-Reported Information to qualified researchers for the purpose of scientific research and publication in a scientific journal, which could also lead to commercial uses of such information. When your Phenotypical Information and/or Self-Reported Information is being used for research purposes, pursuant to our Research, research onsite at PH360 or via a Research Portal, it will never be combined with your Registration Information.

###### You may withdraw your consent to participate in our Research and still continue use of PH360 by contacting us at [privacy@ph360.me](mailto:privacy@ph360.me)  If you do not give your consent to participate in our Research, PH360 may still use your Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information for purposes such as quality control or other R&D activities. Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information used for such purposes may be included in Aggregated Phenotype and Self-Reported Information disclosed to third-party research partners who will not publish the information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific/medical research or conduct or support the development of programs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions.

###### **How We Use User Content and Web Behavior Information**

###### PH360 uses User Content to provide our Services and improve the overall user experience. For example, posts made to the PH360 community forums are publicly displayed to other users. By submitting, posting, or displaying User Content, you give PH360 a non-exclusive license to use any User Content that you submit, post, or display on or through the Services, as further described in Section 13 of the Terms of Service. PH360 may make such User Content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals with whom PH360 has relationships, and to use such User Content in connection with the provision of those services. PH360, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users, may also (a) transmit or distribute your User Content over various public networks and in various media; and (b) make such changes to your content as are necessary to conform and adapt that content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services, or media.

###### Web Behavior Information is collected through log files, cookies, and web beacon technology during a visit to the PH360 website. Web Behavior Information is used to improve our Services and the overall user experience, and if participating in Our Research, your Web Behavior Information may be used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form for our Research intended to be published in scientific journals. If you choose to withdraw consent to participate in our Research, we may still use your Web Behavior Information for R&D purposes as described above, which may include disclosure of aggregated Web Behavior Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

###### **Log Files.**  When users visit our website or use our mobile application, PH360 gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data (i.e. a list of pages or URLs visited). This information may be linked to a particular user’s profile ID or order number. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, identify and resolve issues, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

  1. ###### The ph360.me website also uses cookies. For information about cookies and how they are used on PH360’s website, please read our Cookie Policy.




###### **Web Beacons.**  A web beacon is a clear graphic image that is loaded by your web browser when it accesses a website and that records a user’s visit to a particular web page. We, or third parties that work for us, may place cookies and web beacons on our website, in our emails, and in our advertisements that appear on other websites or in emails sent by others that mention our products and services with our permission. The purpose of our web beacons is to support operation of our website and to offer additional products and services through targeted advertisements. For example, we may use beacons to determine when someone views a web page, count how many individuals visit our website after clicking advertisements placed on other websites, or count how many people have purchased products from our website after viewing an advertisement we placed. Web beacons may also help us determine the effectiveness of an email campaign because the beacons can count the number of individuals who open an email or forward it to others. We use this Web Behavior Information to better tailor our marketing to you and may also use this information to customize content on our website, enable a shopping cart, or conduct research. Third parties only collect anonymous Web Behavior Information through the use of web beacons, allowing statistical analysis relating to the performance of our advertising.

###### If you wish to disable web beacons, it is possible to prevent your browser from loading them, although there is not currently a standard method for doing so.

###### **Information Sharing**

###### PH360 may provide you the ability to connect with other individuals who have PH360 accounts through our community forums, social media and other sharing features. For some features, opt-out is required to avoid notifications. In addition, you may be provided with the ability choose to disclose certain parts of your Personal Information to friends and/or family members, groups of individuals, third-party service providers, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals. We recommend that you make such choices carefully.

###### Personal Information, once released or shared, can be difficult to contain. PH360 will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with a third party. Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the Personal Information of a PH360 customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of that person. It is incumbent upon customers to share Personal Information only with people they know and trust. Users with multi-profile accounts should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.

###### **Ordering PH360 Services as a Gift**

###### If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information for purposes of ordering a PH360 account as a gift, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us, provided that once a gift recipient registers for his or her Services and agrees to our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement, his or her information will be used consistent with this Privacy Statement and those agreements.

###### **Sharing Discoveries**

###### If you provide us personal information about others within the mobile application for the purposes of sharing a PH360 discovery we will use the email address you provide, or access your contacts list if you choose to allow us to do so, to send a one-time email with the discovery and an invitation inviting him or her to visit the site. PH360 does not store this information.

###### If you provide us personal information about others on our website for the purposes of sharing a PH360 discovery we will use the email address you provide and any additional information you provide to send a one-time email with the discovery and an invitation inviting him or her to visit the site.

We will let your friend know that you asked us to contact them. Additionally, we may collect information from you and your friends through the use of cookies and other technology, so we can monitor the success of our referral program and keep track of friends you refer who may sign up for our services and to credit you with any benefit that is available under our referral program .
