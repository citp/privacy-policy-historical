PAGE PROVIDES GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVACY POLICY OF THIS
WEBSITE. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS
PRIVACY STATEMENT WITH YOUR PARENTS OR GUARDIAN AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT
THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.<br> <br> This website (the "Site") is
brought to you by the School Division of Pearson Education, Inc. and
its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Pearson"). The School Division of
Pearson encompasses the Curriculum, Assessment, Student Information,
Family Learning and Teacher Development business lines of Pearson. At
Pearson we are serious about protecting your privacy, and this Privacy
Statement discloses how we collect, protect, use, and share the
personal information gathered on this Site.<br> <br> Your use of this
Site is subject to the Terms of Use posted on this website (which
includes this Privacy Statement). The Terms of Use (including this
Privacy Statement) or any part thereof may be revised from time to time
through an updated posting, and therefore you should check the Terms of
Use (including this Privacy Statement) periodically. Revisions are
effective upon posting and your continued use of this website following
the posting of revisions to the Terms of Use (including this Privacy
Statement) will indicate your acceptance of such revisions. If you have
any questions concerning the Terms of Use (including this Privacy
Statement), please <a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ51p" target="_self">contact us</a>.  </p>  <p>PLEASE
ALSO NOTE THAT THE PRIVACY POLICES OF VARIOUS PEARSON PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES WITHIN THIS SITE OR LINKED TO THIS SITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO
DIFFERENT TERMS AND POLICIES. PLEASE CHECK ON THE APPROPRIATE PRIVACY
POLICY LINK FREQUENTLY TO DETERMINE THE PRIVACY TERMS APPLICABLE TO
SUCH PEARSON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.<br> <br> </p>  <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</strong></p>  <p>We
consider the following to be examples of personally-identifying
information: they include but are not limited to your first and last
name, email address, home address, phone number, social security number
and certain other information to the extent they are linked with your
personally-identifying information.<br> <br> The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at <a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/">www.PearsonSchool.com</a>
in furtherance of serving the user's needs and our legitimate business
purposes. (For example, when the user makes an online purchase or
enrolls in a marketing promotion, we need to retain certain
personally-identifying information on the Site in order to respond to
their request). A user's personally-identifying information may be used
by our company to help us improve the website, and also for our
company's marketing and promotional purposes. We receive and store any
information you enter on this Site or give us in any other way. You can
choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be
able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information
that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests,
customizing features for you, and communicating with you. Except as
specifically stated herein, our policy is not to share this information
with third parties, but we may share this information with other
companies within Pearson. We will never sell this information to
third-party marketing companies.</p>  <p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE.</strong>  </p>  <p>Information
collected through this Site may be supplied to affiliates of Pearson,
and other companies and organizations who perform work for us under
contract or sell products or services that complement our products and
services. We also may disclose personally identifiable information in
the following situations: (a) in response to a subpoena, court order or
legal process, to the extent permitted and required by law; (b) to
protect user security or the security of other persons, consistent with
applicable laws; (c) in connection with a sale, joint venture or other
transfer to some or all of the assets of Pearson; or (d) in order to
enforce the Site's Terms of Use. We otherwise exercise commercially
reasonable care to not otherwise share or disclose the names of users
or any personally identifiable information with third parties, except
with the prior approval of the user.</p>  <h2>SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN</h2>  <p>PARENTS:
We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their
Children (Children 12 and under) and to participate in the activities
that may be offered on this Site. No personally-identifying information
should be submitted to or posted on this Site by Children without the
consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage parents to monitor
their Children's online use, and to help us protect their privacy by
instructing them never to provide personally-identifying information on
this Site or any other website without permission. We are also
prohibited by law from conditioning a Child's participation in any
activity on this website on the Child disclosing more
personally-identifying information than is reasonably necessary to
participate in such activity.</p>  <p>CHILDREN: Please do not give your
full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other
personally-identifying information that would enable someone to contact
you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or
guardian and teacher for permission.<br> <br> We do not knowingly
collect personally-identifying information from Children on this Site
either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily submit
such information through (i) a "<a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ51p" target="_self">Contact Us</a>"
link on a Child's area of this website or (ii) a public posting area,
if such feature is available. If a Child e-mails us via a "<a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ51p">Contact Us</a>"
link on any child directed area of this Site and we can identify the
sender as a Child, any personally-identifying information submitted
will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child and will
thereafter be deleted from our records. In addition, if we have actual
knowledge that a Child is sending or posting personally-identifying
information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially
reasonable efforts to delete such personally-identifying information
before it is made public. We will never request personally-identifying
information from a Child in any of our public postings areas. Please
note that any online store that may be accessed from the Site is
intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age
of 18 and requires the submission of personally-identifiable
information to fulfill and service any transactions.<br>  <br> We may
disclose a Child's personally-identifying information in special cases
when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone
who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally
or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else
that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose a Child's
personally-identifying information when we believe in good faith that
the law requires it.</p>  <h2>PUBLIC POSTINGS</h2>  <p>Users and
especially Children should note that any personally-identifying
information that is voluntarily posted to any public area of this
website may always be collected and used by others. While we monitor
such posting areas from time to time and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to delete a Child's personally-identifying
information prior to posting, we strongly encourage Children not to
post such information.</p>  <h2>COOKIES AND COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</h2>  <p>We
receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact
with this Site. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and
we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses
this Site. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
systems to recognize your browser and to provide customized features to

data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the
add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However,
cookies allow you to take full advantage of this Site's best features,
and we recommend that you leave them turned on. </p>  <p>Prior to user
registration, Pearson may employ cookie technology on this Site to (i)
track non-personal information such as type of browser, operating
system, domain names and IP addresses, and (ii) improve our visitors'
experience online. Prior to user registration, we do not link IP
addresses to any personally-identifiable information. However, once you
register and affirmatively opt-in and provide personal information
about yourself for purposes of receiving more information about our
products and services or ordering products, such personal information
provided by you or collected through the cookie technology may be used
for marketing purposes back to you as specified on a registration page.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other marketing communications
from us, please adjust your registration page to opt-out of further
marketing back to you.</p>  <p>Please also note that Pearson reserves
the right to monitor your compliance with the Terms of Use of this Site
and may track your usage of the Site in order to confirm compliance
with these Terms of Use. Pearson also reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to terminate your access to the Site for any reason,
including non-compliance with these Terms of Use. </p>  <p>Pearson

visitor data on our network of sites. The WebTrends On Demand service
does not collect any personal information such as names, ages, phone
numbers, addresses or e-mail addresses from visitors to the Site.
Pearson uses the WebTrends On Demand service to collect visitor
information like IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet Explorer
