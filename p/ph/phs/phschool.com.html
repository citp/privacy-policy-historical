            <p>THIS PAGE PROVIDES GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVACY POLICY OF THIS WEBSITE. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WITH YOUR PARENTS OR GUARDIAN AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.</p>

            <p>This website (the "Site") is brought to you by the School Division of Pearson Education, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Pearson"). The School Division of Pearson encompasses the Curriculum, Assessment, Student Information, and Teacher Development business lines of Pearson.

            <p>PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE PRIVACY POLICES OF VARIOUS PEARSON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITHIN THIS SITE OR LINKED TO THIS SITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT TERMS AND POLICIES. PLEASE CHECK ON THE APPROPRIATE PRIVACY POLICY LINK FREQUENTLY TO DETERMINE THE PRIVACY TERMS APPLICABLE TO SUCH PEARSON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.</p>

            <h2>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h2>

            <p>We consider the following to be examples of personally-identifying information: they include but are not limited to your first and last name, email address, home address, phone number, social security number and certain other information to the extent they are linked with your personally-identifying information.</p>

            <p>The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at <a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/" onclick="openSmallerInternal('http://www.pearsonschool.com/');return false;">www.PearsonSchool.com</a> in furtherance of serving the user's needs and our legitimate business purposes. (For example, when the user makes an online purchase or enrolls in a marketing promotion, we need to retain certain personally-identifying information on the Site in order to respond to their request). A user's personally-identifying information may be used by our company to help us improve the website, and also for our company's marketing and promotional purposes. We receive and store any information you enter on this Site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing features for you, and communicating with you. Except as specifically stated herein, our policy is not to share this information with third parties, but we may share this information with other companies within Pearson. We will never sell this information to third-party marketing companies.</p>

            <h2>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE.</h2>

            <p>Information collected through this Site may be supplied to affiliates of Pearson, and other companies and organizations who perform work for us under contract or sell products or services that complement our products and services. We also may disclose personally identifiable information in the following situations: (a) in response to a subpoena, court order or legal process, to the extent permitted and required by law; (b) to protect user security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; (c) in connection with a sale, joint venture or other transfer to some or all of the assets of Pearson; or (d) in order to enforce the Site's Terms of Use. We otherwise exercise commercially reasonable care to not otherwise share or disclose the names of users or any personally identifiable information with third parties, except with the prior approval of the user.</p>

            <h2>SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN</h2>

            <p>PARENTS: We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their Children (Children 12 and under) and to participate in the activities that may be offered on this Site. No personally-identifying information should be submitted to or posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage parents to monitor their Children's online use, and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personally-identifying information on this Site or any other website without permission. We are also prohibited by law from conditioning a Child's participation in any activity on this website on the Child disclosing more personally-identifying information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.</p>

            <p>CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other personally-identifying information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or guardian and teacher for permission.</p>

            <p>We do not knowingly collect personally-identifying information from Children on this Site either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through (i) a "<a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS2xE2" onclick="openSmallerInternal('http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS2xE2');return false;">Contact Us</a>" link on a Child's area of this website or (ii) a public posting area, if such feature is available. If a Child e-mails us via a "<a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS2xE2" onclick="openSmallerInternal('http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS2xE2');return false;">Contact Us</a>" link on any child directed area of this Site and we can identify the sender as a Child, any personally-identifying information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child and will thereafter be deleted from our records. In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting personally-identifying information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such personally-identifying information before it is made public. We will never request personally-identifying information from a Child in any of our public postings areas. Please note that any online store that may be accessed from the Site is intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age of 18 and requires the submission of personally-identifiable information to fulfill and service any transactions.</p>

            <p>We may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose a Child's personally-identifying information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

            <h2>PUBLIC POSTINGS</h2>

            <p>Users and especially Children should note that any personally-identifying information that is voluntarily posted to any public area of this website may always be collected and used by others. While we monitor such posting areas from time to time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete a Child's personally-identifying information prior to posting, we strongly encourage Children not to post such information.</p>
