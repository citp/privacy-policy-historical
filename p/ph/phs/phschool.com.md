AS A GENERAL MATTER, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CHECK WITH YOUR TEACHER AND YOUR PARENTS BEFORE SHARING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF OR OTHER STUDENTS ON ANY INTERNET SITE.

## WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED

We consider the following to be personally-identifying information: your first and last name, email address, home address, phone number, social security number and if linked with your other personally-identifying information, your date of birth and other personal interests and hobbies.

This Site does not collect personally-identifying information about a user except for information that is voluntarily provided to us so that we can serve the user's needs and our legitimate business purposes. (For example, when the user makes an online purchase, we need to retain certain personally-identifying information on the Site in order to respond to the order). A user's personally-identifying information (voluntarily submitted in connection with an online purchase transaction) may be used by our company to help us improve the website, and also for our company's marketing and promotional purposes. It will be treated confidentially within our company. Our policy is not to share this information with third parties, but we may share this information with other companies within Pearson.

## SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN

PARENTS: We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their Children (Children 12 and under) and to participate in the activities that may be offered on this Site. No personally-identifying information should be submitted to or posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage parents to monitor their Children's online use, and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personally-identifying information on this Site or any other website without permission. We are also prohibited by law from conditioning a Child's participation in any activity on this website on the Child disclosing more personally-identifying information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other personally-identifying information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or guardian and teacher for permission.

We do not knowingly collect personally-identifying information from Children on this Site either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through (i) a "Contact Us" link on a Child's area of this website or (ii) a public posting area, if such feature is available. If a Child e-mails us via a "Contact Us" link on any child directed area of this Site, any personally-identifying information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child and will thereafter be deleted from our records. In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting personally-identifying information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such personally-identifying information before it is made public. We will never request personally-identifying information from a Child in any of our public postings areas. Please note that any online store that may be accessed from the Site is intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age of 18 and requires the submission of personally-identifiable information to fulfill and service any transactions.

Except as stated in the following two paragraphs, we can assure you that a Child's personally-identifying information will never be provided to third parties.

We may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose a Child's personally-identifying information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

## PUBLIC POSTINGS

Users and especially Children should note that any personally-identifying information that is voluntarily posted to any public area of this website may always be collected and used by others. While we monitor such posting areas from time to time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete a Child's personally-identifying information prior to posting, we strongly encourage Children not to post such information.

## COOKIES AND COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION

Although we may employ "cookie" technology on this Site, it will only be used to track non-personal information such as type of browser, operating system, domain names and IP addresses in order for us to improve our visitors' experience online. We do not typically link IP addresses to any personally-identifiable information.

## LINKS TO OTHER SITES

This Site may provide links to third party websites or resources. The information practices of those websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement or any other policies or terms applicable to this Site. We recommend that you review any terms of use and privacy policy of any linked third party website before providing any information to that website or using its products and services.

Please note that this Site may also provide links to other sites brought to you by Pearson. The Privacy Statement and Terms of Use of other Pearson sites may vary from this Site. We recommend that you review the privacy statements, terms of use and other policies or terms that may apply to other Pearson sites if you should choose to use such sites.

This Site allows a user to contact Pearson directly via email through the use of the "Contact Us" link on the Site. If a user emails Pearson directly through the use of the "Contact Us" link, any personally-identifying information submitted by such user (including email address) will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such user and will thereafter be deleted from Pearson's records.
