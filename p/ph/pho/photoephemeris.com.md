## Your Privacy

We understand that privacy is important to our users and community and we aim to respect your privacy in your interactions with our services. This policy is provided to clarify how your information may be collected and used by us.

## What We Collect

We reserve the right to collect information about your use and interaction with our services to meet our operational, technical and business requirements.

For applications, we use diagnostics and usage information to understand how users are utilizing the software and to help us improve usability and functionality.

Your information is not shared with third parties, except those parties providing the technology we utilize to collect the information, and any other parties to which you have consented.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.

## Data Security

We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, and have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect through our services.
