### 9\. Do Not Track and Online Behavioral Advertising

Do Not Track (DNT) is a browser based signal that, when set, signifies your desire not to be tracked online.

We may work with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other websites. These ad networks use cookies and other Internet Technologies (e.g. web beacons) to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Sites and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some ads are targeted to your interests and preferences based on your browsing history, which is stored in a cookie on your computer. Your browsing history may be tracked in these cookies even if ads are not being displayed.  To help us control the third parties on our Sites and also to comply with a cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), our online advertisements and Sites taking part in Online Behavioral Advertising are delivered with an AdChoices Icon, an industry trust symbol, that helps consumers understand how their data is being used and provides options to consumers who want to exercise control over that activity. By clicking on the AdChoices Icon and following the instructions, you can exercise your privacy preferences. If you opt-out using AdChoices, the third parties on our Sites will no longer use the information they collect about you in order to serve you interest based advertisements. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served non-interest based advertising and you may continue to receive generic ads.
