# Privacy Policy : Phonerated's Privacy Policy - Phonerated.com

This Privacy Policy was last modified on June 24th, 2016.

Phonerated's privacy policy is quite simple: 

  * We are not collecting any email or any kind of personal information.
  

  * If some of our applications ask for your cell phone number, we won't store them unless otherwise noted.
  

  * The only information we look at is the very common and anonymous user behavior data provided by Google Analytics.
  

  * We use anonymous cookies for certain features, like our ringtone matcher quiz, our celliminator phone chooser, and things like learning what links are most popular. Additionally, the ad agencies we do business with may use cookies, just like those of any other website that displays advertisements.



Our main motivation is simply to create the best web site to find the best cell phone and service plan for your needs and we don't need to know your birth date to accomplish that.
