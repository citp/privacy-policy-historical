If you believe “phishers” have gotten access to your personal or financial information, we recommend that you also do the following:

Change your password.   Contact credit reporting services (such as Experian, Callcredit and Equifax) and have a fraud alert attached to your credit report file. Please be aware that the perpetrator may attempt to use your information to establish accounts or obtain credit at other businesses in their name.

## Use of Cookies

Like most web sites, Phoenix TS uses cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve and help personalize your on-line experience.  A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

For example, if you personalize Phoenix TS pages, or register with Phoenix TS site or services, a cookie helps Phoenix TS to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Phoenix TS Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Phoenix TS features that you customized.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Phoenix TS services or web sites you visit.
