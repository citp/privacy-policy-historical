In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. PhoneArena does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on PhoneArena unless you choose to share it with them.
