<h2>Protecting Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>As a valued customer, we recognize that protecting your privacy is important to you.  For this reason, PhotoXpress is committed to protecting your personal information in several ways.  Only a select number of authorized personnel are authorized to access our servers. Your Registration Information is protected by a unique customer password and user ID, and your password is encrypted.
