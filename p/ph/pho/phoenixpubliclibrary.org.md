Phoenix Public Library collects and uses customers' personal information to operate Library websites and deliver requested services. The following guidelines provide information about the types of information collected, how the information is used and when it is disclosed. 

### Guidelines 

####  Collection of Personal Information

  1. Statistical Information: Phoenix Public Library collects information to maintain the quality of its services and to report aggregate information on the usage of its website to City management, as well as state and federal agencies and national library organizations. Such information can include IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses.
  2.

Information collected through one of Phoenix Public Library's websites may be utilized by the Library to provide services through any of its websites.
  3. The Library assumes no responsibility if a customer directly discloses personally-identifiable information or personally-sensitive data through other websites, chat rooms, online communities or other public online forums, resulting in this information being collected and used by others.



#### Use of Personal Information

Phoenix Public Library websites collect and use customer personal information to operate Phoenix Public Library websites and deliver requested services. Phoenix Public Library does not sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide its customer lists or customer-controlled information to third parties.

As a matter of business practice, when customer overdue fees reach a total of $75 or more, customer account information is forwarded electronically to a collection agency.

Customer information may be subject to disclosure under Arizona Public Records Law except to the extent it is privileged or confidential.

#### Control of Personal Information

Certain Library services require the use of a library card number and customer or user name in order to access the service. At any time while accessing any of the Phoenix Public Library's websites, customers may decline participation in any activity that requests information (such as surveys or emails).

#### Collection of Information on Use of Library Computers (PCs)

The information collected on usage of public computers at Phoenix Public Library is limited to reservations. The Library's PC Reservation System retains information on the customer's library card barcode, computer reserved and the date and time of every public computer session for up to 60 days.  Records are accessible to law enforcement agencies with a court order.
