</b><p><b><font face="Verdana">PRIVACY STATEMENT</font></b><font face="Verdana"><br>
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. 
            Because we gather certain types of information about the users of 
            VertMarkets' network of sites and services, we believe you should 
            fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture 
            and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what 
            information we gather and how we use it. 
            </font></p><p><font face="Verdana">
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
                                   VertMarkets collects information from our users at several different points on our web sites. Wherever we collect personal information, we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. When you <b>register</b> with one of 
            our sites or sign up to receive one of our newsletters, VertMarkets 
            may ask for your contact information (such as your email address) 
            and your demographic information (such as your zip code, industry, 
            and job function). We use demographic information to tailor your 
            experience at our web site, showing you content and advertisements 
            that we think might interest you. VertMarkets may also ask for such 
            information at other times, such as when you request information from VertMarkets 
            and/or our customers and suppliers.  The information collected 
            by VertMarkets may be used in a number of ways. For example, VertMarkets will share broad aggregated demographic information with our 
            partners and advertisers. An example would be where VertMarkets 
            provides partners and advertisers with information about the 
            percentage of men or women who visit our sites, or about the types 
            of industries that users come from. VertMarkets' goal in 
            collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with 
            the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers 
            with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a 
            little about you, VertMarkets is able to deliver more relevant 
            content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you. </font></p><font face="Verdana">
            <p>
<font size="2"><strong>With whom does
  VertMarkets share my information?<br>
</strong>If you are requesting
  assistance, product information, white papers, case studies or brochures, your
  contact information may be shared with the developer of the relevant product,
  content, or software. Some materials that are available for download on
  VertMarkets' sites, like white papers, product demonstrations, case
  studies, and product literature, are offered in conjunction with a partner
  company. This information is shared with the partner company so that they may
  provide you with the material you requested. </font>
</p><p>
<b>Promotion and Direct Mail</b><br>
Our web sites provide you with the choice to receive promotional emails from VertMarkets and/or its partners. If you choose to receive promotional emails from VertMarkets and/or its partners, you will be giving VertMarkets permission to access your information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. We will not share your information with 
these pre-screened partners unless you have opted in to receive promotional emails from such partners. If you have chosen to receive such emails and later change your mind, you can remove yourself from this distribution list via a link in the communication or by unsubscribing at this site. VertMarkets and/or its partners may also send direct mailings to your postal address from time to time. If you do not want to receive direct mailings from VertMarkets and/or its partners, you can remove yourself from this distribution list by notifying us through the link set forth below. In addition to VertMarkets, agents working on behalf of VertMarkets under confidentiality agreements, and certain suppliers who are in contract with VertMarkets, may 
contact you about products and services that may be of interest to you via 
e-mail, direct mail, or phone. VertMarkets does not control or monitor these 
communications conducted by these suppliers.
