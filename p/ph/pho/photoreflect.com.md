#### Protecting Your Photos

**Photography Customers:** Your photos are organized into events that your photographer can password-protect upon your request. Share your Event ID and password only with those whom you wish to have access to your photos. Friends and family will then have the ability to add your photos to their personal online photo albums and/or order packages that are offered by your photographer. Further, all enlarged representations of your photos on the PhotoReflect.com Web site are digitally watermarked with either "PhotoReflect.com" or your photographer's company logo embedded directly into the images.

Any photos you upload to PhotoReflect are stored temporarily for the use of previewing and production of your selected products. The uploaded photos are not meant for sharing and will not be made available for public viewing. For your convenience we will keep your uploaded photos from your session for a short period of time to allow you to return to make your creative and buying choices. After such time the photos will be permanently deleted from PhotoReflect.

**Photographers:** Any sale of your photography is sold by your policies. You are enabled to password protect events and watermark your photography as you see necessary. The sale of Digital Delivery products enables you to sell your clients digital images for their use. It is at your discretion to opt-in or out of Digital Delivery as well as managing the formal rights of your photography any further use beyond original intention.
