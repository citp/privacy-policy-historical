**Required Information**        
Name, e-mail address, mailing address, daytime phone number, credit card number, and expiration date are required for all orders. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you of important functionality changes to the Web site, new PhotoReflect.com services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. When you use the PhotoReflect.com PhotoCard service, we ask for your e-mail address and that of the recipient in order to complete your request. PhotoReflect.com will never disclose or send promotional e-mail to recipient addresses that are provided only to the PhotoReflect.com PhotoCard service.   
**Protecting Your Information**  
When placing orders or accessing your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but in most cases you can change this option in your Web browser.   
**Protecting Your Photos**        
Your photos are organized into events that your photographer can password-protect upon your request. Share your Event ID and password only with those whom you wish to have access to your photos. Friends and family will then have the ability to add your photos to their personal online photo albums and/or order packages that are offered by your photographer. Further, all enlarged representations of your photos on the PhotoReflect.com Web site are digitally watermarked with either "PhotoReflect.com" or your photographer's company logo embedded directly into the images.  
**Disclosure of Your Information**  
PhotoReflect.com's Privacy Policy prohibits selling, trading, or renting your personal information to others. If the Privacy Policy changes to include trustworthy third parties, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to refuse to share your information. Also, PhotoReflect.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information.
