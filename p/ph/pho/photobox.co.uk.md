It provides you with details about the types of personal data that we collect from you, how we use your personal data and the rights you have to control our use of your personal data. Words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as is attributed to them in the [Photobox Terms of Use.](http://www.photobox.co.uk/content/legal/terms-of-use)

## What personal information do we collect about you ?

The purpose of this is so that a record may be kept by the third parties of who has purchased Products from them. It is a condition of your use of our Services that you agree to this disclosure of this data.

## How do we use your personal information ?

Your personal data will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by our subsidiary and/or affiliated companies and other data processors acting under contract with us:
