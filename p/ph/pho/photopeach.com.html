	</ul>

	<h4>Information  Relating to Children</h4>
	<p>COPPA requires that we inform parents and  legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information  from children under 13 years of age. The Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and  Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize  that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to  visit and utilize the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services. COPPA requires  that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under  13 years of age to use certain features of the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and  Services.</p>
	<p>When your child attempts to register and/or  provide Personal Information to Nota, Inc. (including on any of the Nota, Inc.  Sites, Products and Services), we require a parent or legal guardian to:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
			<li>Complete the registration;</li>
			<li>Review this Policy and to verify that the child's       parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices       related to children protected by COPPA; and,</li>
			<li>Verify through the use of an email confirmation       and second authorization that the parent or guardian consents to any       applicable Terms of Service and this Policy.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Once parental notice and consent has been  verified, the information we collect will be treated the same as information  collected from any other user of the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services.  Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect Personal  Information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have  inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it and not  disclose or transfer any such information to third parties.</p>

	<h4>How  Parents can Access their Children's Personal Information</h4>
	<p>In compliance with COPPA, parents and legal  guardians may request us to review, delete or stop the collection of the  personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so by contacting  us by letter, phone or email using the address information provided at the  bottom of this page.</p>
	<p>If you request that no further information  about your child be collected or used, we will be required to terminate your  child's ability to use the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services that require  a user to "sign in."</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We may also periodically engage in co-marketing activities,  where we work with a complementary solution provider to launch a joint  marketing program.&nbsp; In these situations,  we will only send information to you on behalf of the other; we do not provide  your Personal Information to such partner.&nbsp;  We may also enter into business partnerships with other parties to  provide specific services.&nbsp; If a user signs  up for these services or responds to a particular marketing offer, we may share  Personal Information such as your name or other contact information that is  necessary for our business partner to provide these services or get in contact  with you.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Where you are contacted with an offer or  service based on information you have shared with any Nota, Inc. Site, Product  and/or Service, we will do our best to provide you with an opportunity to  opt-out of receiving such further communications at the time you are contacted,  however, in connection with any of our paid products and services (i.e.,  products or services that you license or use for a fee), we reserve the right  to send you certain communications relating to those products and services,  such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Nota, Inc.  Newsletter, that are considered part of your Nota, Inc. account, without  offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>

			<li>In the course of operating our business it may be       necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your Personal Information       to others such as our service providers, contractors and select vendors so       that we can operate the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services and our       business. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements       that are consistent with this Policy and that limit others' use or       disclosure of the information you have shared.</li>
			<li>We may share your Personal Information to respond       to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our       legal rights or, defend against legal claims and if in our judgment in       such circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate.</li>

			<li>As we continue to develop our business, we may       also sell or transfer all or part of our business.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>D. Other</h3>
	<h4>Changes  to this Privacy Policy</h4>
	<p>Nota, Inc. may revise, modify or update  this Policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat Personal  Information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your  particular Nota, Inc. account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.&nbsp; You are responsible for periodically checking  our Website for changes to this Policy.&nbsp;  If at any time we decide to use Personal Information in a manner  different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will take  commercially reasonable measures to obtain consent from you.&nbsp; You will have a choice as to whether or not  we use your Personal Information in this different manner.&nbsp; </p>
	<h4>Personal  Information Storage and Security</h4>
	<p>We take reasonable precaution to protect the Personal  Information we collect from customers, prospective customers, and  visitors.&nbsp; When users submit Personal  Information via the Website, the information is housed in a secure in-house  database in one or more of our offices.&nbsp; The location of our offices may change from time to  time and we may acquire offices in other countries at any time.&nbsp; You  acknowledge and agree that we may transfer your personally identifiable  information to or through any country which may not have privacy (data  protection) legislation and regulation comparable to the law of the country in  which you reside. </p>
	<p>While we strive to protect your Personal Information, you  should know that information sent over the Internet, whether by e-mail or by  using one of our on-line forms, is not necessarily secure against  interception.&nbsp; No data transmissions over  the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot  ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do  so at your own risk. </p>
	<p>To prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, maintain  data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in  place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure  the Personal Information we maintain.&nbsp; We  use industry-standard technology, such as firewalls, in an effort to protect  the confidentiality of your Personal Information.&nbsp; Moreover, we encrypt your transmission of  sensitive information to us (e.g., account passwords and payment-related  identifiable information) via SSL (secured socket layer) protocol in the interest  of heightened privacy protection and information integrity.&nbsp; Your account information is also password-protected.&nbsp; However, please note that this is not a  guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or  destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
	<p>In addition, only employees who need the information to  perform their duties are granted access to personally identifiable  information.&nbsp; The unauthorized access or  use of such information by an employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds  for disciplinary action.&nbsp; Additionally,  our information management systems are configured in such a way as to block or  inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no authority to  access.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Furthermore, our trusted vendors and business partners may  be responsible for processing or handling some of the information that we  receive.&nbsp; These vendors and business  partners are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those  specified by us and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we  treat such information.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>If Nota, Inc. learns of a security systems  breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take  appropriate protective steps. By using the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and  Services or providing Personal Information to us you agree that we can  communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and  administrative issues relating to your use of those sites, products and  services. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach  occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the  applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you  have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you  may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To  receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent  from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@notaland.com">privacy@notaland.com</a>.</p>
	<h4>Changing  your Preferences and Personal Information</h4>
	<p>You can edit your account information with  an applicable Nota, Inc. Site, Product and Service at any time. Most Personal Information  you may provide is entirely optional. For example, to the extent that parents  are considering whether to permit their children to use the Nota, Inc. Sites,  Products and Services, we do not condition a child's participation based upon  their provision of any more Personal Information than is necessary to operate those  sites, products and services.</p>
	<p>You can delete your applicable account by  visiting the applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some Personal  Information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records to  the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document compliance with  regulatory requirements.</p>
	<p>To have access to your Personal  Information, you must provide proof of identification such as full name, street  address, city/state and zip code, and/or information about your recent activity  on the Website.&nbsp; We reserve the right to  deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about your  identity.&nbsp; And if the burden or expense  of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks  to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we  may decide not to provide access to such information.&nbsp; </p>
	<h4>Opt-Out Provision&nbsp; </h4>
	<p>When we first collect information from you,  we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of having your Personal  Information shared with parties outside of Nota, Inc. (unless otherwise  described in this Policy).&nbsp; In addition,  if you do not want us to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and  services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or information  collection.&nbsp; If, at a later date, you  choose to have your name or any other Personal Information removed from our  mailing list, you can do so by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@notaland.com">privacy@notaland.com</a>.&nbsp; </p>
	<h4>Users Outside the United States</h4>

Sites, Products and Services from outside the United States, you are  thereby consenting for your Personal Information to be processed in the United  States in the manner described in this Policy.&nbsp;  Furthermore, you acknowledge that the privacy laws of the State of  California and the United States may differ from the laws in the country where  you are located and may not provide you the same rights or protections as those  laws.</p>
	<h4>No Guarantees</h4>
	<p>While this Policy states our standards for  maintenance of Personal Information and we will make reasonable efforts to meet  them, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards.&nbsp; There may be factors beyond our control that  may result in disclosure of Personal Information.&nbsp; As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties  or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of any Personal  Information collected from any Nota, Inc. Site, Product or Service.</p>
