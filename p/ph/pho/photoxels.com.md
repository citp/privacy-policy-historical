# Privacy Notice - Photoxels

Photoxels works incredibly hard to ensure that the information contained within the pages of our site is accurate, relevant and of the highest quality. This privacy statement is written to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy.

No personal information is collected on this site.

The company that hosts our site do collect information on their server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. We have access to those log files. We do not examine IP addresses on an individual basis, but examine only aggregate totals for unique visits, page views, and megabytes downloaded per month. 

Any correspondence you have with us is treated with the strictest confidentiality. No personal information or IP address is ever revealed to any third party. No information is sold, exchanged or divulged for any commercial purpose.

When you shop at one of the vendors who advertise on our site, you are dealing directly with that vendor, who is then responsible for the privacy of any personal information you choose to divulge to that vendor. Photoxels has no access to any personal information you provide those vendors, nor do we have responsibility or liability for their independent policies. For more information of the privacy policy of these vendors and other vendors who advertise here, please see the Privacy Notice for that vendor (Read privacy notice of [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496/002-3121096-8593660), [Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/918814/701-5313004-2193152), [TribalFusion](http://www.tribalfusion.com/www/about/privacy.html), [Shopping.com (Dealtime)](http://www.shopping.com/xCPT-about_privacy), [AllPosters](http://www.allposters.com/help/guarantee.asp#privacy)).

Advertisers automatically forfeit any monetary claims should they post inappropriate content.
