Tech Enterprises may also record which products and services you are interested in and which products and services you purchase as well as. This information will be kept securely in accordance with our internal security policy and may be used to: 
    * process any order you may place; 
    * provide you with an up to date, efficient, and reliable service; 
    * open and run your account;

  * If you are a new customer Tech Enterprises will give you the choice (for example once you have registered your interest) whether or not you want us or other relevant and reputable companies to contact you about future offers, events and new products or related activities that you may find useful. Tech Enterprises will not bombard you with emails, but Tech Enterprises would like to keep you informed of the developments of Tech Enterprises. 
  * Tech Enterprises do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other companies but from time to time Tech Enterprises may want to share data with other reputable companies within the European Union who may have interesting offers and information for you. Tech Enterprises will not send you any marketing emails or pass your information on to third parties unless you give us your consent, unless Tech Enterprises have it already. You will therefore be asked if you would like to receive information from Tech Enterprises and others in future.
