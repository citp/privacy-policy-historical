Persons who are residents of the member countries of the European Union (“ **EU** ”) or other data subjects covered by the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679 (the “ **GDPR** ”), have certain additional privacy rights under applicable law.  The following provisions of this Section 12 provide an overview of these additional rights.

12.1 _Legal Bases for Processing Personal Information of European Union Citizens or Other GDPR Data Subjects_

When processing your personal information, Phobio may rely on one or more of the following legal bases (or other available legal grounds), depending on the circumstances:

(a) Legitimate Interests – Phobio may process your personal information where Phobio has a legitimate interest in such processing for managing, operating or promoting our business, and that legitimate interest is not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms.

(c) Contractual Necessity – Phobio may process your personal information where such processing is necessary in connection with any contract that Phobio has with you.

12.2 _Disclosures to Third Parties_

Your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties except for where it is necessary for fulfillment of Phobio’s obligations to you or where Phobio is obliged or permitted to do so by law (including, without limitation, through the terms of any agreement Phobio may have with you), or where Phobio makes disclosures that are otherwise consistent with the uses described in this Privacy Policy.

Phobio may also disclose any information (including personal information) relating to you to law enforcement authorities or any regulatory or government authority in response to any request including requests in connection with the investigation of any suspected illegal activities.

Phobio reserves the right to transfer any personal information Phobio has about you in the event Phobio sells or transfers all or a portion of our business or assets, or merges with another organization. Should such a sale, transfer or merger occur, Phobio will use reasonable efforts seeking to require that the transferee uses personal information you have provided to Phobio in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Phobio will not sell, resell or lease your personal information to any third parties but Phobio may, if required for the purpose(s) for which your personal information was collected and processed, share it with Phobio partners and/or service providers to enable them to provide their services to Phobio or to you, as applicable. The foregoing are in addition to the other uses described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

12.3 _Security of Personal Information of European Citizens or Other GDPR Data Subjects_

Phobio has policies and technical and organizational measures in place which are intended to safeguard and protect your personal information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, improper use and disclosure. However, you should be aware that information transmitted over the internet is not completely secure because of the nature of the internet and that systems and measures used to secure information are not flawless. For these reasons, although Phobio will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, Phobio does not warrant the security of personal information transmitted to Phobio or stored by Phobio, and personal information that is transmitted to Phobio by you electronically is done at your own risk.

12.4 _Retention of Personal Information of European Citizens or Other GDPR Data Subjects_

Phobio’s policy is to retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which Phobio collected such personal information, including for the purposes of satisfying any professional, legal, accounting or reporting requirements to which Phobio is subject. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, Phobio considers the scope, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, the purposes for which Phobio collected and processed your personal information and whether Phobio can achieve those purposes through other means, and any applicable legal and professional requirements.

12.5 _Your Rights as a European Citizen or Other GDPR Data Subject_

You have a number of rights concerning your personal information that Phobio holds and uses, including the following:

(a) Right of Access – You have the right to be informed about what personal information Phobio holds about you and to a copy of this personal information.

(b) Right to Rectification – You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information which Phobio holds about you updated or corrected.

(c) Right to Erasure – In certain circumstances you may request that Phobio delete the personal information that Phobio holds about you.

(d) Right to Complain – You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding the processing of your personal information to an applicable governmental or supervisory authority in your country.

(e) Right to Withdraw Consent – Where processing of personal information is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time.

(f) Right to Object – Where Phobio relies on our legitimate interests to process your personal information, you have the right to object to such use and Phobio is required to discontinue such processing unless Phobio can demonstrate an overriding legitimate interest in such processing.

(g) Right to Restriction – You have the right to request that Phobio stop using your personal information in certain circumstances including if you believe that the personal information Phobio holds about you is inaccurate or that Phobio’s use of your personal information is unlawful. If you validly exercise this right, Phobio will store your personal information and will not carry out any other processing until the issue is resolved.

You may exercise any of the above requests in writing to Phobio, 800 Battery Ave SE Suite 100, Atlanta, GA, 30339 or at support@phobio.com.
