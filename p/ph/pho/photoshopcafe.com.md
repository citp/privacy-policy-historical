  * The analytics service(s) used by Our Site use(s) Cookies to gather the required information. **[Certain of these Cookies may be placed immediately when you first visit Our Site and it may not be possible for Us to obtain your prior consent. You may remove these Cookies and prevent future use of them by following the steps set out below in section 12.10.]**
  * The analytics service(s) used by Our Site use(s) the following Cookies:



[Google Analytics](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html) sets first party cookies via a piece of JavaScript code which must be added to every page that site owners want to track. It sets four cookies automatically, and a fifth via opt-in (this relates to sharing information about your traffic with Google).

Globally and in the European Union member states Google sets the following cookies:

 **[__utma Cookie](http://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/cookies/__utma)** **  
** A persistent cookie – remains on a computer, unless it expires or the cookie cache is cleared. It tracks visitors. Metrics associated with the Google __utma cookie include: first visit (unique visit), last visit (returning visit). This also includes Days and Visits to purchase calculations which afford ecommerce websites with data intelligence around purchasing sales funnels.

 **[__utmb Cookie](http://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/cookies/__utmb)** ** ** **&** ** ** **[__utmc Cookie](http://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/cookies/__utmc)** **  
** These cookies work in tandem to calculate visit length. Google __utmb cookie demarks the exact arrival time, then Google __utmc registers the precise exit time of the user.

Because __utmb counts entrance visits, it is a session cookie, and expires at the end of the session, e.g. when the user leaves the page. A timestamp of 30 minutes must pass before Google cookie __utmc expires. Given__utmc cannot tell if a browser or website session ends. Therefore, if no new page view is recorded in 30 minutes the cookie is expired.

This is a standard ‘grace period’ in web analytics. Ominture and WebTrends among many others follow the same procedure.

 ** ** ** ** **[__utmz Cookie](http://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/cookies/__utmz)** **  
** Cookie __utmz monitors the HTTP Referrer and notes where a visitor arrived from, with the referrer siloed into type (Search engine (organic or cpc), direct, social and unaccounted). From the HTTP Referrer the   __utmz Cookie also registers, what keyword generated the visit plus geolocation data.

This cookie lasts six months. In tracking terms this Cookie is perhaps the most important as it will tell you about your traffic and help with conversion information such as what source / medium / keyword to attribute for a Goal Conversion.

 **[__utmv Cookie](http://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/cookies/__utmv)** **  
** Google __utmv Cookie lasts “forever”. It is a persistant cookie. It is used for segmentation, data experimentation and  the __utmv works hand in hand with the   __utmz cookie to improve cookie targeting capabilities.

By default, most internet browsers accept Cookies but this can be changed. For further details, please consult the help menu in your internet browser or the documentation that came with your device.

 **Licensing**  
PhotoshopCAFE’s training programs are sold under a Single User License. For Multi-user licensing and licensing policies contact us.

This is our new way of serving you with the content that you need, where you need it and when you need it.  
For a long time, I have wanted to get you your training in a way that it’s flexible to fit your lifestyle. We didn’t want to just copy what other people are doing, because that isn’t always working.

The reason is we want to look to the future and serve the present. We simply cannot do that while hanging on to the past. I have heard from so many of you, that you no longer have a DVD player in your computer and that most new computers haven’t had a DVD ROM for a number of years.

I have also heard from a lot of you, that you are now wanting to watch your training on tablets and phones. However, you don’t necessarily want to be connected to the internet all the time. You travel on trains in planes, busses, and ubers and want to watch your training there too (Actually this is the best time to learn. Turn your commute into a university).

Another thing, Adobe is doing smaller, incremental updates between major releases. It’s impossible to do a re-run of a DVD each time and send it out. Also, emailing a new download is difficult, and if you miss the email, you would miss the update.

So the solution that we came up with is PhotoshopCAFE ANYWHERE.

This means, in the future, when you buy premium training from PhotoshopCAFE, you can download it to your computer. All the video files are in the clips folder and named in such a way, that they will be easy to use when you copy them to your mobile devices (Through iTunes, or your player of choice). So you can watch them anywhere.

But that’s just part of anywhere. The other part is anytime access. You will have your own control panel, where all your downloads will be listed and you can re-download them, whenever you like.

This means, on certain training, we will be able to drop in updates that you will be able to download them whenever you like and stay up to date.

In fact, if you have purchased a download from us in the past 3 years, just log into your account and your downloads are there now, today!

BONUS. You know those nice bonuses, the Superguides and blending modes ebook.? Yup, you can also download those whenever you like from your account.

Let me show you what you can do. Go to your account and login. (Note, this email list and PhotoshopCAFE account are not the same.

Re download your training here

This is just the beginning! We have lots of work to do and lots of ideas to expand all of this for you in the future. PhotoshopCAFE is one of the longest-running Photoshop resources in the world, and we plan to be around to serve you long into the future. PhotoshopCAFE ANYWHERE is one way that we can do this.

 **1\. So you are ending DVDs?**  
After 17 years and pioneering CD and DVD Roms in our industry (yes, we were the first), we have to cut the anchor, DVDs are fast becoming obsolete. However, you will be able to get them at our sister site [software-cinema.com](http://software-cinema.com/) (we are launching a new SC site very soon too – with DVDs).

 **2\. I bought a DVD, can it be added to my account?**  
Unfortunately, there just isn’t a way to do that right now, the man-hours would be enormous to do that.If you have a DVD, you can still copy the digital files from the clips folder to your mobile devices and other computers, so you still have the ability to watch your training anywhere.

 **3\. Is this a subscription?**  
No, you still buy your training as you need it and some of the courses will come with free updates in between major Adobe updates. Big releases like 2017/2018 will be paid purchases.

 **4\. What about streaming video?**  
We have had streaming video for 2 years now at [academy.photoshopCAFE.com](http://academy.photoshopcafe.com/) If you have purchased our streaming training courses, nothing has changed for you, just remember that it’s a separate account login. We are looking at adding a streaming option to PhotoshopCAFE in the near future. (Just one exciting feature on its way)

 **5\. I bought a download 4 years ago, 10 years ago. Can it be added?**  
We can go back 3 years because this is how long we have been using the database solution we have and we are able to import accounts. Before that, we processed everything manually and we didn’t have accounts.

Please also be aware, that there might still be a few little bugs as we sweep up the dust on this big release. Let us know if you find any (please be patient as we fix them).

I hope you are as excited as we are moving forward! This is just the beginning and I’d love to hear what you would like to see here at your CAFE.
