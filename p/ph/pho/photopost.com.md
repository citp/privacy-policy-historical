**What information is collected:**

PhotoPost.com collects certain information from and about its users in three ways -- directly from the user, from our Web server logs, and with cookies. 

User-Supplied Information: When you register for PhotoPost.com, we may ask you for your name, email address, invoice numbers pertaining to online transactions, and some other personal information. The more accurate information you volunteer, the better we are able to customize your PhotoPost.com experience. 

Server Log Information: When you visit an Internet Web site, you disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location (e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a PhotoPost.com page). All Enthusiast, Inc.'s PhotoPost.com, like many other sites, records this basic information about visits to its site. 

Cookies: In order to offer and provide a customized, personal service, PhotoPost.com uses cookies to store and help track your information as you travel throughout the site. For example, we may use cookies to help remind us who you are and to deliver content and services based upon your account information. In addition, third party advertising networks may issue cookies when serving advertisements. 

Cookies are simply pieces of information that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The use of cookies is relatively standard and you will likely find them used on most other major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you receive a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that certain areas of many sites may not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie. 

You should remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, such as in message boards, through e-mail, discussion groups, or in chat areas, your information can be collected and used by others. Allthough All Enthusiast, Inc. tries to protect your personal information, All Enthusiast, Inc. cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are also solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords you set up and/or any account information.
