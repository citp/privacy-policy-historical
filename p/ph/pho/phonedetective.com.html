      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We provide the information to       trusted partners who work on behalf of or with us. These companies may use       your personal information to help communicate with you about offers from       us and our marketing partners.

        <li>We respond to subpoenas, court       orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or       defend against legal claims.</li>
        <li>We believe it is necessary to share       information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding       illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential       threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms and       Conditions, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
        <li>We transfer information about you       if we are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we       will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address specified       in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our Website before       information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different       privacy policy.</li>
        <li>We may display targeted       advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad       serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or       click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women       ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.</li>
        <li>We do not provide any personal       information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted       advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement       you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the       assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the       advertisement.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We may set and access our cookies       on your computer.</li>
        <li>We allow other companies that show       advertisements on some of our pages, to set and access their cookies on       your computer.
