        <li>We use local storage objects (LSOs) to store content information and preferences.

      <ul>

        <li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees and contractors who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
        <li>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@phonedetective.com">privacy@phonedetective.com</a>.</li>
