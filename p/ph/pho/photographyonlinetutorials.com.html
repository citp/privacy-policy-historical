<h2 style="color: #4b4b4c;">Website Usage Information</h2>
<p style="color: #4b4b4c;">We may collect information automatically about the use of the Website, through, for example, “cookies” or “IP addresses” (as described below). Photography Online Tutorials&nbsp;also archives log files and uses non-personally identifying information in aggregate form to detect errors with the Website, identify security issues, build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of Photography Online Tutorials&nbsp;users, and measure demographics and interests in connection with specific areas of the Website. We may provide such statistical data to our advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. For example, we may inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their websites. We also use such data to create a more enjoyable experience for our users, for example, to assist in selecting content and advertisers featured on specific channels, pages and site areas based on your general likes and dislikes.</p>
<p style="color: #4b4b4c;">“Cookies” are small files websites place on your hard drive that allow websites to identify you. For example, if you allow a website to remember your login name or password, the website places a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other information on your hard drive. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you when you visit the Website. We may use cookies to measure Website traffic, to offer you certain services, or to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.</p>
<p style="color: #4b4b4c;">The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.</p>

If another company acquires Photography Online Tutorials&nbsp;(or a business unit of Photography Online Tutorials&nbsp;that uses your Personal Information), the Personal Information collected by Photography Online Tutorials&nbsp;will be transferred to that company and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
