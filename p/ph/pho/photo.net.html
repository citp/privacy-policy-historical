<h1>PHOTO.NET &amp; YOUR PRIVACY</h1>

Photo.net was created to be a community for photography enthusiasts to share their photographs, find common interests, critique with peers, and build photography skills by interacting with the community.

We take your privacy very seriously and think you should too. This is your community. The following is your Privacy Policy.

LAST UPDATED September 23, 2006

<h2>Terms Used</h2>
Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include your name or city/state/country. Any posts that you make on the site will be attributed to your name and city/state/country associated with your account.

Information We Collect and How We Use It
Readers who do not register. We collect and store the the IP address of the user's computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user clicked directly to our site ("HTTP referer") and, in some cases, to which the user clicks to follow a hyperlink from our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to various sections of photo.net and we sometimes share this information, typically aggregated, with third parties for advertising or commercial purposes.

Registered readers. We collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through the registration process. If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our site, we we collect and store information about the transaction. We disclose your full name, city, state, and country of residence, and posting history to other readers. We disclose your email address only to other registered readers.

We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of photo.net.

<h2>Cookies</h2>
Cookies are small text files that our site can send to your browser for storage on your hard drive. Cookies can make your use of our site easier by saving your status and preferences for your next visit to photo.net. Due to technical limitations in our software, if you disable cookies in your browser, you won't be able to register and login. A browser with disabled cookies is still able to read any of the content on our site.

Some photo.net pages incorporate HTML or Javascript code that references advertisements or Google Analytics tracking blank images. Advertisers and Google may set cookies in your browser as well. More information about these companies may be found at the following addresses:

<h2>Google privacy</h2>
<h2>Yahoo! privacy</h2>
Third Party Advertising
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit Photo.net. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on Photo.net, other sites and other forms of media about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here.

<h2>Your Password</h2>
We store your password in clear text, currently, in our database. This has the advantage that we can email it to you if you forget it. It has the disadvantage that if our security is compromised, your password will be available to others. Please do not use the same password at photo.net that you use at security-critical sites, such as online banks.

<h2>Sale or Merger of photo.net</h2>
If photo.net is sold, pledged or disposed of as a going concern whether by merger, sale of assets, bankruptcy or otherwise, the user database of photo.net could be sold as part of that transaction and all User Information accessed by such successor or purchaser.
