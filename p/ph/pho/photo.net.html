<h2>
photo.net Privacy Policy
</h2>
Your use of the photo.net Web site constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and consent to the terms herein.  Please see the section labeled "Information We Collect and How We Use It" to learn more about our collection and use of user information.
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

photo.net is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our Web site and users of the other services available through our site (the "Service(s)").  We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you provide us remains private and is used only for the purposes set forth herein.
<p>
This privacy policy details our commitment to protect your information and the limited manner in which we will use that information to provide and improve our provision of the Services. 

</p><h3>
Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy
</h3>

	Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms.  "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date.  "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer.  We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users.   Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.
<h3>  
Information We Collect and How We Use It
</h3>
If you visit our site to browse.  We will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user's computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting our site.  We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites and to help us make our sites more useful.  For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics.  This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes.  When we share such information with third parties we will require them to abide by the standards of this privacy policy.
<p>
If you register or engage in a transaction while at our site.  To make full use of our Services you will need to complete our registration process. We collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through this registration process, including your user ID and password, which we may elect to provide for you.  If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our site, then we collect and store information about the transaction.  If you send us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to you.  
</p><p>
We use the information we collect from you as a registered user to build features that we hope will make the Services more attractive and easier for you to use.  This may include better customer support and timely notice of new services.  We may share User Information with our partners, affiliates and joint venturers that are committed to serving your need for the Services and improving your user experience, but will require such third parties to abide by the standards of this privacy policy.  We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the site and use of the Services, such as demographical and statistical information, for marketing, research and other purposes.  Furthermore, we may need to disclose User Information to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or our users to legal liability.
</p><h3>
If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information
</h3>
If you do not want to provide us with certain User Information then you may opt out by not using the Service that provides us with such User Information.  For example, if you do not want us to retain your name, then you may choose not to become a registered user.  You will not be entitled to the benefits of registration, but you are still free to browse the site and to visit the parts of the site accessible to non-registrants.
<h3>  
Cookies
</h3>
Cookies are small text files that our site can send to your browser for storage on your hard drive.  Cookies can make your use of our site easier by saving your status and preferences upon visits to our site.  The cookies are refreshed every time you enter the site.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent.  We use cookies for two purposes: (1) to enable photo.net to customize information for certain segments of its customer base; and (2) in some instances, to associate you with your User Information.  For example, through the use of cookies you may login automatically and thereby save you time.  Although rejection of cookies will not interfere with your ability to interact with most of our site, you will need to accept cookies in order to login and use certain interactive Services on the site.  

<p>Many photo.net pages incorporate HTML or Javascript code that will cause your browser to connect to
third-party servers to retrieve an advertisement. These servers may send cookies to your browser.
photo.net    has a direct relationship with a small number of advertising networks, which are third parties in the business of serving advertisements incorporated into the pages of other web sites. While we may have studied the privacy policies of our partners at the time the relationships were established, we don't monitor the policies of our partners, and they may change without our  becoming aware of it. 
Furthermore, advertising networks have relationships with one another and some of the ads may come from parties with whom photo.net has no direct relationiship, and of whom we are not even aware.  Accordingly, we cannot assume responsibility for the use made by
third parties of information collected about you through these "third-party" cookies.   If you are concerned about this, most modern Web browsers allow you to block so-called "third party cookies", and this should not affect your browsing experience on photo.net. Also, many ad networks provide an option  to "opt-out". Notwithstanding this, if 
you object to a third-party cookie being placed on your browser through the use of photo.net, and have specific
information that a third-party is making inappropriate use of the cookie, we would appreciate being notified by you.
</p><h3>
Control of Your Password
</h3>
Except as specifically permitted by this privacy policy or your User Agreement you may not disclose your photo.net password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties.  If you lose control of your photo.net password you may lose control over your Personally Identifiable Information, and you will be responsible for any legally binding actions taken on your behalf.  Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password or, if we provided your password, notify photo.net so that we may issue you a new password. 
<h3>
Removal or Correction of Personally Identifiable Information
</h3>
<p>You may also "Unsubscribe" from the site by following a link from 
"Your Workspace".  This will have the effect of concealing the information that you
provided upon registration from users of the site, other than administrators.  If you "unsubscribe", 
you will lose access to the parts of the site for which you must provide such 
Personally Identifiable Information in order to gain access.   

</p><p>If your Personally Identifiable Information is edited by you, we will not make 
any attempt to apply your edit to backup copies that we may have of the information, 
and in the event that it is necessary for us to
restore our database from a backup, it is not impossible that your edit would be lost 
and the information previous to your edit would be restored.   In such an event, we might 
not be able to determine that this had happened.  Your recourse in such a case, having 
observed it, is to edit the information again.

</p><p>If you unsubscribe, the Personally Identifiable Information in your user record 
won't be displayed to users other that administrators.  However, the information 
may be retained in our  database and backup copies thereof, for our records, and 
as necessary for us to comply  with governmental orders, resolve disputes, 
troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreement you have entered into through our sites 
and as otherwise deemed reasonably necessary by us.

</p><p>Unsubscribing will not result in the deletion of any messages, photos, comments, or other
information   that you have posted in forums, the gallery or other sections of the site.   
Furthermore, there are many types of information 
that you may post on the site  which cannot be deleted, editied, or recalled in any way 
and which which become, indefinitely, a part of the archives of the site, in many cases 
accessible  to other users of the site.

</p><p>Examples of transactions which cannot be removed or edited are: 
forum postings, classified ads, "ezShop" member opinions, comments on articles and 
other  HTML pages, links,  surveys and polls, and "neighbor-to-neighbor" postings.   We reserve to change the site features related to the editing and deletion of site content, and transactions and content that is editable or deletable when you submit them may not be editable or deletable in the future.

If you include Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, address, email address
in such transactions 
etc, you will not be able to remove or edit it.    The site does not provide a 
service to have staff members or administrators remove such information for You.  
If You do not wish to have Personally Identifiable  Information become part of 
the archives of the site, either do not include such information with the transactions, 
or if the transaction requires such information, do not perform the transaction.

</p><p>If We ban you from the site without at least 24 hours notice to the 
email address that you register with us, upon your request We will 
either delete information that you posted that you would have been able to delete 
yourself if you had not been banned, or We will temporarily reinstate you for a brief 
period so that you may delete the information yourself.


</p><h3>
Third Parties
</h3>
This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of User Information collected by photo.net.  If you disclose information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with photo.net.
