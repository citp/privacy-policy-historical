**Privacy Policy for PhotoWorks**  
  
PhotoWorks, Inc. ("PhotoWorks") is firmly committed to safeguarding the privacy of our customers. This page will inform you about our information-gathering and dissemination practices whether such information is obtained through the [www.photoworks.com](http://www.photoworks.com/) Web site or through a partner's Web site.  
  
**Privacy Philosophy**  
PhotoWorks is committed to providing you with a safe and private environment in which you can upload, share, and print your photos. All of your photos are password-protected and are visible only to you unless you explicitly share them, or your password, with others. By e-mailing an invitation (e-mail link) to share your photos or posting your photos to a community viewing page on PhotoWorks, you give users the opportunity to view as well as buy prints from images you explicitly designate for sharing. However, those who have received your invitation can then forward links to your images for viewing by others. PhotoWorks does not share your images with anyone or provide information about your photos, unless you explicitly decide to do so, or unless required to do so to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order. Please click here to review the PhotoWorks [Terms of Service](http://www.photoworks.com/support/terms.aspx).

Your personal information is used to conduct business with you, to verify your identity as a registered PhotoWorks customer for access to the customer images, and for the delivery of prizes or other materials. Personal information may be rented, sold, or shared with partners or other businesses that may market their products to you. Customers will have the option to “opt out” of this arrangement as described below. However, PhotoWorks does not rent, sell, or share your e-mail address with anyone unless you explicitly give us permission to do so, or unless required to do so to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order. Demographic information is used to personalize your experience at the site and may be used as part of aggregated data, such as for marketing, promotional and advertising purposes, for statistical analysis of user behavior, and for product development and content improvement.

**PhotoWorks may change this Privacy Statement without notice from time to time. Please visit this page often for updates and changes. We will gain consent from our customers before using the information collected in a manner different from that stated at the time collected.**

Below you can find our complete Privacy Statement. If you have any questions about privacy at PhotoWorks, please send us an e-mail at [privacy@photoworks.com](mailto:privacy@photoworks.com).

**What personally identifiable information does PhotoWorks collect from me and how is it used?

Information you explicitly provide

Order Forms

**  
PhotoWorks uses online order forms to allow you to order prints and products from PhotoWorks. When you fill out order forms, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, mailing and e-mail addresses and financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date. We use this information to process your order and to notify you of your order status. Your e-mail address and financial information are used by PhotoWorks to conduct business with you and are not rented or sold to any other third party unless you explicitly give us permission to do so, or unless required to do so to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order. It will be shared with those persons necessary to process your order. For example, your financial information may be shared with the financial institution that issued your credit card. In addition, customers will be notified by e-mail when their order is received and when their photographs are available online.

**Shopping**  
PhotoWorks uses third-party vendors to fulfill orders for certain products and services sold on the PhotoWorks Web site. In the event the product or service you purchase is fulfilled by a third party, personal information such as your name, mailing and e-mail addresses and financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date will be shared with the third-party provider to process your order and to notify you of your order status. The third party provider may not use this information for any purpose other than to process your order and it will not be used for additional sales or solicitation by the third party, nor rented or sold to any other third party unless you explicitly give us permission to do so, or unless required to do so to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order.

**Registration Forms: E-mail Updates, Contests, and Surveys**  
PhotoWorks uses online registration forms for you to request services such as PhotoWorks e-mail updates, our newsletter, and for you to receive special offers, promotions, and to register for contests or sweepstakes. Subscription to our e-mail updates is optional and requires your consent. You can opt in or opt out of receiving e-mail updates at any time by following the simple procedure below. When you fill out the registration form you will also be asked to provide personal and/or demographic information such as your name, gender, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the program and, in the case of a contest or sweepstakes, verify eligibility and notify the winner. Submitting such personal information is entirely voluntary. The more information you provide (and the more accurate it is), the better we can serve you. This information is used to maintain your account at PhotoWorks and may be shared with our partners. For example, some customer surveys, special offers, promotions, or contests may be sponsored by one or more of our partners. In those cases, the personal information you submit for the contest or survey may be shared with the sponsoring partner. Customers will have the option to “opt out” of this arrangement either at the time the information is collected, at the time the registration is confirmed, or by following the procedures described below. 

We may also ask questions about your camera's make and model and your use of digital images. 

Sometimes we use personal and/or demographic data to tailor your experience at our site, by showing you content and offers that we think you might be interested in based on the information you provided to us, and by displaying content and offers according to your preferences. Although we do not share personally identifiable information with our partners unless you have given us permission to do so, we may make aggregate statistical and demographic information available to select third party partners of PhotoWorks. Such statistical and demographic information does not personally identify you. 

Wherever PhotoWorks asks you to provide personally identifiable information on the Web site, we make every effort to include a direct link to this Privacy Statement on that page.

**Tell a Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and e-mail address. PhotoWorks will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. PhotoWorks stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact PhotoWorks at privacy@photoworks.com to request the removal of this information from our database.

**Does PhotoWorks collect any information automatically and how is that information used?**

**Cookies & User ID**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer, which may contain information that the user has consented to provide. We use cookies to manage your PhotoWorks session. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site although some functionality may be limited. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Internet Protocol Address**  
We analyze Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to your PhotoWorks User ID, with the following exception: when you place an order using our online checkout process we may record your computer's IP address along with your order to help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this information with the financial institution that issued the credit card used to place an order, or with law enforcement authorities if we determine, or are notified, that the use of the credit card was fraudulent.

**Affiliate ID**  
If you entered our site by clicking a link or banner ad on one of our affiliate Web sites, we will store the ID of the affiliate site in our database along with your PhotoWorks User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. Your personally identifiable information will not be shared with any affiliate without your express consent.

**Supplementation of Information**  
In order for PhotoWorks to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual’s preferences, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners or other companies to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes purchases from these partners or other companies, the partners or other companies may collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users’ preferences.

**Does this Privacy Statement extend beyond PhotoWorks to external links?**  
This site contains links to other sites that may include partners or affiliates of PhotoWorks. PhotoWorks is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other Web sites.

**How does PhotoWorks protect the security of the personal information I provide?**  
Keeping your personal and financial information secure is vitally important to us. We urge you not to disclose your personal information or password to anyone. The PhotoWorks site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Financial information is transferred between client and PhotoWorks Web server using a public/private key encryption method using a certificate authority (VeriSign). We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Access to data is limited to authorized PhotoWorks staff members. Web security and security procedures are reviewed and updated to ensure data protection. 

**What is the PhotoWorks policy regarding the ability to update, correct, or delete personally identifiable information?**  
If your contact information changes, please notify customer service by phone at 1-800-746-8696 or send an e-mail message to customercare@photoworks.com. If you have forgotten your password, please request a new password by sending an e-mail message to customercare@photoworks.com.

Your PhotoWorks account can be deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any password-protected area of the PhotoWorks site. Please contact privacy@photoworks.com for further instructions about deactivating your PhotoWorks account.

If you are participating in a PhotoWorks promotion and you wish to update your e-mail address on the promotions mailing list or to quit a promotion and cease receiving promotion-related e-mail, please contact privacy@photoworks.com.

**Does PhotoWorks provide the ability for customers to “opt out”?**  
Our users are given the opportunity to “opt out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by including “no e-mail” in the subject line of their return e-mail or e-mail us at privacy@photoworks.com. You may also notify customer service by phone at 1-800-746-8696. 

We make every effort to make our e-mail updates and announcements regarding promotions, special offers, contests, and sweepstakes relevant to our customers, but they always have the opportunity to opt-out when registering with us. They may also notify customer service by phone at 1-800-746-8696 or send an e-mail message to privacy@photoworks.com with their request to opt out of receiving communications from PhotoWorks. 

**Are children eligible to use the Web site?**  
Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our services and we ask that they do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 13, you can use this service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians. We strongly recommend that parents and guardians supervise their children’s use of the Web site. Although access to photographs is password-protected, children who obtain access to a personal password may have the ability to post or distribute personally identifiable scanned or uploaded photos, or may provide others with the ability to view or purchase such photographs by sending an e-mail invitation as described above. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example, on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas – that information may be collected and used by others. If you post personal information online in a place that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PhotoWorks cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any financial information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you send information online.

**Who can I contact if I have questions about this Privacy Statement or the Web site?**  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can send e-mail to privacy@photoworks.com.
