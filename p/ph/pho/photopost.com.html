      <p>All Enthusiast, Inc.'s PhotoPost.com respects the privacy and security of 
      its users. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet 
      experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are 
      most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we 
      sometimes collect information during your visits to understand what 
      differentiates you from each of our millions of other users.
      </p><p>In order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have 
      prepared this statement disclosing the privacy practices for the entire 
      PhotoPost.com site. Additional terms and conditions regarding the collection 
      and use of your information are also be provided to you before you 
      register for our site. Here, you will learn what personally identifiable 
      information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your 
      information, how we protect your information, who has access to your 
      information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
      </p><p><b>What information is collected:</b>
      </p><p>PhotoPost.com collects certain information from and about its users in 
      three ways -- directly from the user, from our Web server logs, and with 
      cookies.
      </p><p>User-Supplied Information: When you register for PhotoPost.com, we may 
      ask you for your name, email address, invoice numbers pertaining to online transactions, and some other personal information. 
      The more accurate information you volunteer, the better we are able to 
      customize your PhotoPost.com experience.
      </p><p>Server Log Information: When you visit an Internet Web site, you 
      disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet 
      Protocol (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location 
      (e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a PhotoPost.com page). All 
      Enthusiast, Inc.'s PhotoPost.com, like many other sites, records this basic 
      information about visits to its site.
      </p><p>Cookies: In order to offer and provide a customized, personal service, 
      PhotoPost.com uses cookies to store and help track your information as you 
      travel throughout the site. For example, we may use cookies to help remind 
      us who you are and to deliver content and services based upon your account 
      information. In addition, third party advertising networks may issue 
      cookies when serving advertisements.
      </p><p>Cookies are simply pieces of information that are sent to your browser 
      from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The use of 
      cookies is relatively standard and you will likely find them used on most 
      other major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept 
      cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you 
      when you receive a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should 
      understand that certain areas of many sites may not function properly if 
      you set your browser to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie.
      </p><p>You should remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
      information online, such as in message boards, through e-mail, discussion 
      groups, or in chat areas, your information can be collected and used by 
      others. Allthough All Enthusiast, Inc. tries to protect your personal 
      information, All Enthusiast, Inc. cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
      any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You 
      are also solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords 
      you set up and/or any account information.
      </p><p><b>How and When Information is Used</b>:
      </p><p>We use information in different ways, depending on the type of 
      information: User-supplied information: This information is used for 
      purposes such as personalization and verification.
      </p><p>Web Server Logs: This information helps us identify which areas of our 
      site are of interest to our visitors. PhotoPost.com also collects the 
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of its visitors for the purposes of 
      system administration and to report aggregate information to our 
      advertisers.
      </p><p>Cookies: We use cookies to let you use our services more easily and to 
      let us keep track of certain statistical information that helps us improve 
      our site. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so 
      that you won't have to re-enter them the next time you visit.</p><p>

Your Email Address:  We use your email address to send you information 
about your ResellerRatings account, such as your username and password, 
and confirmations of reviews that you have submitted to the site.  From 
time to time, we may email you to let you know about new site features no 
more frequently than once per month but generally only a few times per 
year.  Your email address is never sold or otherwise provided to a 3rd 
party.</p><p>

Invoice Numbers: When you submit a review of an online merchant to PhotoPost.com, we ask you to provide an invoice number for your transaction 
with that merchant as evidence that you did indeed enter into a transaction with that merchant.  Merchants have the ability to login to ResellerRatings to 
view invoice numbers submitted to our site by their customers for any given review of that merchant.  Therefore any invoice number that you submit to 
our website is visible to the merchant to whom your review pertains, but not to any other merchants or users of our website.</p><p>

      </p><p><b>How We Protect Your Information:</b>
      </p><p>The privacy and protection of your personal information is vitally 
      important to us. PhotoPost.com does not make personal information available 
      to any third parties without your permission. Any user statistics that we 
      may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding your 
      PhotoPost.com usage are provided in the aggregate only and do not include 
      any personally identifiable information about any individual user.
      </p><p>Your access to some services and content is password protected. We 
      recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PhotoPost.com 
      will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an 
      unsolicited email. You should not disclose your user name and password to 
      others. In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of 
      your PhotoPost.com account or service at the end of each session. You may 
      also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work. 
      This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and 
      correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a 
      computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
      </p><p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
      to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your 
      personal information, PhotoPost.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
      any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or 
      services. You transmit all such information to us at your own risk. 
      However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort 
to 
      ensure its security on our systems.
      </p><p><b>Who Has Access to the Information:</b>
      </p><p>Except as described below, All Enthusiast, Inc.'s PhotoPost.com will not 
      willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about its 
      users to any third party without first receiving that user's permission. 
      All Enthusiast, Inc.'s PhotoPost.com may disclose personal information when 
      we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the rights 
      or property of All Enthusiast, Inc.'s PhotoPost.com. All Enthusiast, Inc.'s 
      PhotoPost.com will use its best efforts to contact you if All Enthusiast, 
      Inc. is issued a subpoena or other legal process that requests your 
      identity.
      </p><p>When you are at the PhotoPost.com site and asked for personal 
      information, you share that information with PhotoPost.com alone, unless the 
      service is offered in conjunction with another party. For example, some 
      PhotoPost.com services are offered in conjunction 
      with another company. In order to provide such co-branded services to you, 
      it is necessary for us to share your personal information with the company 
      offering the co-branded service. If you do not want your data to be 
      shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of data by not using that 
      particular service. If you choose to share your data with a provider of a 
      co-branded service, you should understand that those providers may have 
      separate privacy and data collection practices. All Enthusiast, Inc. has 
      no control over and accepts no liability for these independent practices. 
      Each provider shouldmore information regarding its privacy and/or use 
      policies.
