## WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT

We collect personal data you share with us directly, as well as information shared by your web browser and third parties. 

We collect personal data you knowingly choose to disclose to us. "Personal data" is information that can be used to individually identify you. We also collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser when you view and navigate our website, as well as information provided to us by third parties. 

## Personal Data You Provide to Us

You provide personal data to create an account with us. 

### Account Management

When you register a member account, you will be asked to provide basic contact information, including your name, company, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address. As part of your account, we will ask you to create a user name and provide a password. 

We collect this information for the purpose of providing you with access to certain features on our websites or services you request. Maintaining a member account also makes it easier for you to register for webinars, access member-only exclusive content, download white papers, and request information by prepopulating submission forms with your contact information, which you may edit before sending for these purposes. 

Registering an account is voluntary, and we collect your personal data only upon your consent when you submit the registration form. You can withdraw your consent and cancel your account at any time by contacting us at [privacy@photonics.com](mailto:privacy@photonics.com) with your request. 

You provide billing information for purchases. 

### Purchase Fulfillment

To process an order made through our bookstore, we will collect basic contact and billing information, including name, address, telephone number, and if applicable fax number, email address, and payment information. We collect this information for the purpose of completing our transaction with you. We will only collect this information if you initiate a purchase through our bookstore. If you do not complete your purchase, we will retain the information you have input to allow you to easily return and complete your purchase at a later time. 

You provide data to receive publications and communications. 

### Subscription and Communication Management

If you choose to subscribe to our newsletters and publications, we will ask you to submit your name, company, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address. 

We use this information for the purpose of delivering requested copies of our content. Delivery of our newsletter and publication content directly to you does require your contact information, but you can manage your communication preferences as described in this section under "Manage Your Communication Preferences." 

As part of registering for our free subscriptions, we also collect information about your employment, such as job title and technologies and products you work with. We use this information to verify that you are eligible for a free subscription, as well as to provide you with additional communications regarding information we think you may find interesting. When we collect this information, we ask for your consent to use this information for marketing purposes. You can change, withdraw, or withhold your consent at any time by managing your communication preferences. 

If you contact us directly, such as to request information on advertising rates or order copies of our publications, your communications with us may include your contact information. In such circumstances, we only collect your contact information when you initiate contact with us.

Some information for the Buyers’ Guide is only collected for aggregate demographics about the industry and markets, and those fields are marked as such. Do not submit any information you do not want published publicly or used for these purposes. 

You provide data to facilitate your participation in special events. 

### Interactive Feature Participation

You may also choose to participate in different interactive features we offer. We only collect this information for the purpose of facilitating your participation in our interactive features.

In some cases, we may also request your address, telephone and fax numbers, and country to provide the entity you wish to contact with more options to contact you. Some of these fields are optional and your message can still be sent without providing optional details. 

We also collect and retain a copy of your outbound message, which will contain any additional personal information you provide. This information is only collected when you request we contact a company or advertiser on your behalf and will only be used for such purposes. 

### Contests

When you enter a contest, you may be asked to provide your name, email address, company name, and telephone and fax numbers. This information is used to verify your identity, notify you that your entry has been received, and contact you if you are a winner and/or prize recipient.

We provide this content at no cost to you and rely on sponsors to help keep this content available to you at no charge.

We occasionally conduct surveys. If you choose to participate in the survey, you may be asked to provide basic demographic information, such as job function and technologies and products you work with. You also will be asked to provide additional information related to the survey topic, which may include personal data. We use this information to conduct statistical analyses on topics of interest to our users, and your data will only be reported in aggregate form. Additionally, if you choose to provide a free-text comment in your survey response, we may publish your response, but we will remove your name and any identifying information before publication. We only collect this information when you consent to participate in the survey. 

## Personal Data From Others

We collect data through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. 

### Cookies and Passive Tracking

In certain circumstances, we may obtain non-personal information about your use of this website through cookies. "Cookies" are small files placed on your computer by your browser and are often used to make websites work, as well as provide information to the website operator. We also collect information on read and click-through rates of our email communications through the use of beacons.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. If you disable cookies in your browser, you may not be able to use all of the interactive features of our website. 

Please note that some advertisers may use cookies when you click on their advertisements on our site. Those cookies are controlled by the advertisers and are not subject to this privacy notice. 

### Third Parties

When you interact with content provided by or about our advertisers, we compare your IP address against our own databases, as well as databases provided by third parties, to match your IP address to your company and geographic location (at a country-level). The IP matching database provided to us by a third party is housed on our internal network, and when we access the database, your information is only read by our network. We do not share your IP address with the third party. 

We match your IP address to your company and country only when you interact with our advertiser content or information, as we collect and share this information with our advertisers for the purpose of helping our advertisers make decisions about the relevancy and usefulness of content they provide to our users. We do not share more than your company and country location with our advertisers without your consent.
