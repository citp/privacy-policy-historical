# Privacy Policy | Photonics Media

Laurin Publishing Co., Inc. is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of those who visit our websites.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how our visitors can correct or change it.

This Policy discloses the privacy practices for the entire Laurin Publishing network of websites, which includes [Photonics](https://www.photonics.com/d6170/photonics "Definition of photonics").com, PhotonicsSpectra.com, PhotonicsBuyersGuide.com, Biophotonics.com, EuroPhotonics.com, IndPhotonics.com, and other sites. It answers the following questions:

  4. What is Laurin Publishing's opt-out policy?

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [info@photonics.com](mailto:info@photonics.com) for clarification.

**1\. What information does Laurin Publishing gather/track?**

Laurin Publishing collects two types of information about our site visitors: aggregated "traffic data" derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites; and personal data that some visitors provide through optional, voluntary subscription to one or more of our print publications, registration for membership on our website, registration for webinars, or participation in certain contests. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to our users' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. When you register on our site to view premium content or attend a webinar, the personal information you supply may be shared with the content sponsors.

**Registration and Premium Content**

Registration is required to use certain features of our website, including posting comments in our community forum, subscribing to our e-newsletters, submitting changes to dictionary terms, and viewing premium content. Premium content includes white papers and webinars. When you voluntarily register or supply your personal information to see premium content, the personal information that you provide may be made available to the sponsors of that content.

**Contests**

Laurin Publishing may offer from time to time voluntary, optional contests in which we request certain personal information, including the user's name, e-mail address, company name, job title/function, and the service or product his or her company provides. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that his or her entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Under no circumstances will Laurin Publishing divulge this information to a third party.

Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.

**E-mail**

Users of the Laurin Publishing websites may voluntarily e-mail Laurin Publishing from time to time with requests for information on advertising rates or to order copies of our publications (such as the Photonics Buyers' Guide). Such e-mails may include the user's name and other contact information in addition to his or her e-mail address. Under no circumstances will Laurin Publishing divulge this information to a third party.

**2\. What does Laurin Publishing do with the information it gathers/tracks?**

Laurin Publishing uses any information voluntarily provided by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

Laurin Publishing uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out free subscriptions to our print publications and periodic electronic newsletters. Laurin Publishing does not share subscriptions or mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or partners, with the exception of premium content as stated above. However, from time to time we may forward on to our readers carefully selected and screened mailings from certain advertisers or other companies which we feel may be of interest. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please e-mail us at [info@photonics.com](mailto:info@photonics.com).

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like, based on traffic to those areas. This helps us to continue to build a better service for you.

Laurin Publishing creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. 

**3\. With whom does Laurin Publishing share the information it gathers/tracks?**

Laurin Publishing uses the information described above to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. When you voluntarily register to see premium content, the personal information that you provide may be made available to the sponsors of that content.

The Laurin Publishing websites contain links to third party sites. Laurin Publishing is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click through to its site, please contact that advertiser directly.

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name and e-mail addresses) on any bulletin boards or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.

**4\. What is Laurin Publishing's opt-out policy?**

Laurin Publishing gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  * Opting not to receive any informational mailings forwarded from third parties when subscribing to or ordering one of our publications or our electronic newsletter. 
  * Opting not to provide certain personal information when completing a subscription application, ordering a publication, or participating in a contest. 
  * Opting not to subscribe to or order one of our publications or our electronic newsletter, which eliminates the need for any personally identifying information from our users. 



**5\. How can visitors correct and update personally identifiable information?**

To correct or change the information collected during subscription to one of our publications, please visit our website's subscription areas for Photonics Spectra, Biophotonics, or EuroPhotonics.
