### Questions we get asked, frequently.

Before reaching for the phone we do ask that you have a quick read through the following, just in case we can save you the keystrokes or the cost of a phone call.

#### Where are my records?

We aim to dispatch the same day if orders are placed before 4pm Monday to Friday so anytime after this we can usually say that they are “on their way”. Depending on which delivery service you choose we may be able to track your records, please see shipping methods below.

#### Its been ages, I think my records are lost in the post – what now?

Sometimes packages do go missing. We have to allow a certain period of time for us to be able to consider items lost.

UK – 15 working days.  
Overseas – 28 working days.

While these may seem excessive, we have known items to take this long and it is only after these periods have elapsed that we can claim for compensation.

#### Do you have a particular record in stock?

If you are able to add a record to your basket on the website then it is almost definitely in stock. Our website stock is shared with our physical shop and is updated constantly. However, sometimes things go missing or are sold in the shop at the same time as on our website. If we are unable to completely fulfil your order we will contact to let you know whether we might be able to source another copy of the record or whether we will have to adjust your order and payment.




Dear customer, due to a recent security upgrade imposed by our online payment providers our checkout page will only work with the latest versions of all main browsers. This has been done to ensure your details remain secure while shopping on our site. If you have trouble connecting please upgrade to the latest version of your favourite browser and that should resolve the issue. If the problem persists please get in touch with our customer service team - customerservice@phonicarecords.com - thanks.
