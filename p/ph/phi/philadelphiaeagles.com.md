_User Provided Information_

“Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you.  When other information, such as a favorite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy.  We collect Personal Information such as your full name, telephone number, street address, email address, unique identifiers (like your Message Board User ID and password), demographic information (like your date of birth, age, gender, ticket holder status, game attendance, marital status, or number of children), and financial information (like your credit or debit card number) in various ways and for various reasons.  For example, we collect Personal Information when you sign up for our newsletters, register for an account on our Website, create account recovery credentials, register to play games on the Website, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys or voting polls, contribute to a social forum on the Website, or submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on the Website.

The “Tell-A-Friend” tool provided on the Website and/or in our e-mails allows you to send information about us to your friends and family members.  When you use this tool, we will ask you for your friend's or family member’s name and email address.  We will then use this information to automatically send your friend or family member a one time email inviting him or her to visit the Website.

_Website Usage Information_

As is the case with many Websites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit the Website.  We may also capture certain “clickstream data” pertaining to your Website usage.  Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your Web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Website, the pages or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, the next Website you visit when you leave the Website, and any search terms you have entered on the Website or a referral site. 

In addition, we and our third party partners may deploy various tracking technologies on the Website to collect additional information about your Website visits.  For example:

  * Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a Website.  A cookie may enable us to relate your use of the Website to other information about you.  Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Website (for example, by storing your MemberID and/or password for the online store) or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information.  Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Website or its features.  To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click here.
  * HTML5 (the language some Websites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your site usage activities.  This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Website is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.
  * A pixel tag (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our Web pages.
  * Email Communications: When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.



These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our partners on our behalf. These technologies may enable us to relate your Website Usage Information to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

**By using our Website, you agree to our use of tracking technologies through our Website.**

_Social Networking_

We maintain presence on several social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and we also incorporate some of their features onto our Website, such as Facebook’s “Like It”.  Through these platforms and features, we receive some Personal Information and some usage information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well.  In addition, third party social networking platforms have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them will use and protect your information.

_Information Obtained from Third Parties_

We may supplement the Personal Information we collect from you with information that we obtain from third parties, such as our partners in sponsored content sections, our affiliates with whom you have previously done business, and data aggregators.  The information we obtain from third parties may include, but is not limited to, things like your contact information, preferences, and demographic information.

As applicable, we or one of our trusted partners may use the information we collect from and about you to:

  * contact you about the Website or your membership status;
  * respond to your requests, questions, and concerns;
  * confirm or fulfill an order you have made;
  * inform you of a prize you have won and deliver it to you;
  * monitor or improve the use of the Website;
  * develop new features and offerings on the Website;
  * customize the advertising and content you see;
  * monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Website;
  * assess the level of interest in, and use of, the Website, our e-mails, and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate; and
  * send you our promotional material and special offers and those of third parties.



To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Website Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information. 

We may share your personal information with others for various purposes. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing with third parties who need your information in order to provide services to us (or on our behalf) and sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the Website with other Website users, we may share your information:

  * with the public if you win a contest or sweepstakes, but subject to the terms and conditions of such contest or sweepstakes, and not without your consent unless the law requires us to;
  * subject to your consent on a one-time basis, with third parties for their own marketing purposes;
  * subject to your consent, with our sponsor(s) if we obtain your information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotional activity that is offered by a third party or jointly offered by us and any third parties;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request; and
  * in connection with a corporate change including a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or sale of assets.



In addition, we may share Website Usage Information and other non-personally identifiable information about our users and user behavior with our marketing partners, affiliates, and other third parties.

If you do not want us to send you our marketing emails, you may let us know by clicking on the appropriate link within the email you receive, changing your preferences at the preference center of our Website [here](http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/register.html), or by sending an email to [webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com](mailto:webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com) with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.  To opt out of our SMS messages, please text STOP to 82565.

Please understand the following with respect to your request to opt out of having your information shared or receiving further promotional communications:

  * it may take us a few days to process your request
  * to stop receiving communications from a third party with whom we have already shared your Personal Information, you must contact that third party directly
  * even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us
