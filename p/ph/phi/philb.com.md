## What my privacy policy covers

I take your privacy seriously. This page will give you more information on my privacy policy.  
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

## Collection of information and my use of it.

The only information that I collect on visitors is that which is captured by the statistics package used on my hosting service. This will include details from your browser and your IP address.

If visitors write to me then I will obviously be in possession of the details that they wish to make public.

You do not have to register to make use of this website, nor give any information to me in order to use it.

## Information disclosure

I do not share, rent, sell or otherwise share any information about visitors to my site with anyone else.

I would however respond to request for information from appropriate legal authorities, regarding any legal issues, but since I can't see that happening on my site it's a theoretical point.

## Cookies

Cookies may be set on your computer by other companies that show advertisements on this site. Use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. I do not set cookies myself.

## Access

Access to data would only be possible within the last month, and all that would be available would be confirmation that your particular IP address had visited my website.

## Confidentiality

I am the only person with access to any data stored in statistics files on the server hosted by my hosting company. It is not shared.

## Changes to this policy

Any changes will be made as and when necessary. Any significant changes will be advertised on my home page and weblog.
