To enable the purchase of these and other products, we collect and store billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.

Some of our readers are invited to be members of an optional survey. Panel members agree to participate in surveys about their readership of philstar.com, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Readers are contacted via e-mail, which link to online surveys. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released.

philstar.com uses the information collected from your interaction with philstar.com by Text Messaging Service (SMS) ("SMS Service") solely for the purposes of our SMS News Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone  number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.

philstar.com collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and philstar.com. When you send a text message to philstar.com or via philstar.com, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction.
