**1\. Will Blue Flame ever send SPAM to this address ?**

We do not send SPAM. By entering your email address, you agree to receive email from us about product updates and special deals. We usually send only one message each month. If you wish not to receive these messages, you can remove your email address from our list at anytime by using the form on our website - YES IT DOES WORK!. 

**2\. Why do we collect user information when you download ?**

When you download a piece of software from us, we log your Name, Email Address and IP address. We do this to help detect illegal downloads and software piracy. Our software is quite popular and believe it or not, there are some crooked people out there that try to steal it. 

**3\. How is the information we collect used ?**

We keep a database of our users names and email addresses for product update and upgrade notifications. When we release a new version of any of our software titles, we send a message to all of our registered users and let them know. Other than that, we like to tell our users about new and exciting products and price reductions, also to announce other significant mambo events 

**4\. Will this personal information ever be used for any other purpose ?**

The only time we would ever use your personal information for any other reason is to aid the proper authorities in finding fraudulent credit card charges or in finding those responsible for illegal distibution or piracy of our software. 

**5\. Will Blue Flame ever sell this information to a third party for advertising ?**

Are you kidding ? Nope. Never. Not a chance. 

If you have any further questions regarding our usage of your personal information, please contact our director personally at [phil@phil-taylor.com](mailto:phil@phil-taylor.com).
