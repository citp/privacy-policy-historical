### 1.2 Aggregated data

We may share data that does not identify you individually, in the aggregate (“ **Aggregate Data** ”).

However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Information such that it can identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Information, and it will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Examples of how we may aggregate information include, but are not limited to, collecting demographic information about our audience to make decisions about editorial topics or types of events, or we may aggregate technical information to track the performance of certain articles or advertisements.

## 2\. How Do We Receive or Collect Your Personal Information?

### 2.1 Directly from you

We may collect your Personal Information directly or indirectly from you both online and offline. Examples of how you may provide this information are: volunteering your email address in order to sign up for newsletters; volunteering your information when you subscribe to our magazines or affiliated publications; purchasing products or services; purchasing tickets to events affiliated with _MetroCorp_ ; purchasing classified advertisements; sending a letter to an editor; entering a sweepstakes or contest; or completing a survey.

_Purchases_  
If you should make a purchase, including a subscription for a magazine, we will typically ask for your name, address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and the expiration date. If the product or subscription is provided or shipped by a third party, we will securely pass on to the third party the information needed to fulfill your order.

_Promotions_  
_MetroCorp_ may from time to time sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events (“Promotions which require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact information plus demographic information. These Promotions may also ask registrants to answer survey questions. Any personally identifiable information collected through Promotions will be treated as personal information. No purchase is ever necessary to enter a _MetroCorp_ Promotion.

_Surveys_  
_MetroCorp_ will, from time to time, conduct anonymous surveys and polls of users to our Site to obtain aggregate demographic information about the users. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals unless otherwise disclosed in any survey or poll rules. Should _MetroCorp_ request other personally identifiable information from you, you are not required to share any such information to gain access to the Site. Simply, you can refuse to provide any such information.

_Sign-Ups and Orders_  
Additionally, you may be able to sign up for certain promotions, newsletters, or affiliated publications on behalf of or for delivery to third parties. You may order a service as a gift for a third party and send such gift directly to the third party through a submission of the third party’s name, address, email address and telephone number. This also constitutes personally identifiable information.

### 2.2 Using Automated Tracking Mechanisms, including Cookies

As is true with most websites and digital properties, when you interact with the Site, or when you interact with us by email, using your computer, mobile phone, tablet, or similar device (“ **Device** ”), we may automatically collect, or facilitate the collection of, Personal Information or other information about your interactions with us and our services and your Device equipment.

For example, we may collect Device information such as domain name, client host name, internet protocol or IP address, device operating system and browser, and information about your online activity (like content viewed and pages visited). This may be done using first and third party cookies, Flash cookies, HTML5 local storage, server logs, web beacons, clear gifs, and other similar technologies. Cookies are small files of letters and numbers stored on your browser or device that enable the cookie owner to recognize the device when it visits websites or uses online services. A website you visit may set cookies directly, known as first-party cookies, or may trigger cookies set by other domain names, known as third-party cookies.

We use these automated technologies and the information collected for different purposes. We may automatically use some cookies that are strictly necessary for the core functionality of our Site, providing the services you request, enabling communications, and providing a secure digital environment. For example, cookies may be used to authenticate your identity for payment processing. They also may help us know where you have indicated certain cookie preferences, including refusals, to ensure your preferences are honored. Additionally:

  * _MetroCorp_ may use, or facilitate the use of, non-essential functionality cookies that enable helpful functions to provide an enjoyable user experience. For example, by recognizing when you return to a Site (so you do not need to register or re-enter your information every time you visit, enabling us to personalize content for you, remember your preferences, and the like).
  * We may also use, or facilitate the use of, analytic or performance cookies. For example, these allow us and our third party service providers to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Site when they are using it. This helps us improve how our Site works and ensuring that visitors can easily find what they need on our Site. These analytic cookies generally generate aggregate statistics that are not associated with an individualized profile. For example, our Site may use Google Analytics or ScoreCard to track how often visitors access or read our content. We use this information in the aggregate to understand what pages and features of our website’s visitors find useful. To better understand Google Analytics, and how you can opt-out of the Google Analytics features, we encourage you to visit the following: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>. We do not control third party service provider websites, platforms and applications collecting your Personal Information, in this regard, and are not responsible for their privacy statements. We encourage you to read the privacy notice or policy of every website you visit or application you use when you use or enable these platforms and applications, or leave the Site.



Your permission for our collection and use of your Personal Information using automated tracking mechanisms may be managed in a variety of ways at the operating system level of your device or equipment, through third-party platform extensions, or you can learn how else you can exercise your option not to accept these cookies. It should be noted, however, that should you disable or not accept cookies, portions of the Site may not properly function, or it may limit or interfere with your Site experiences or ability to access Site features, functions, and customizations.

_User Experience and Third Party Advertisements._  
Your Personal Information may also be collected by us or by third parties with services or advertisements on our Site in order to customize your interactions and provide a more meaningful advertisement experience (for example, so you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly). This also may mean you will see advertising that is most likely to interest you. This is because advertisers display their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer’s experience and the effectiveness of the advertisements. Depending upon your settings, cookies may also allow third parties engaged in interest-based advertising on our site to recognize your browser software on other sites, as well. This may be because, in the course of serving certain advertisements, some advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect information about your visits to our websites and other websites. These third parties gather this information for the purpose of understanding how users are using our sites, and making improvements to our sites. Your consent for this collection and use may be managed in a variety of ways at the operating system level of your device or equipment, through third-party platform extensions, or you can exercise your option not to accept these cookies by clicking [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F). Your access to _MetroCorp_ Sites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by these third party advertisers. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of cookies and interest-based information collected for advertising purposes during your visits to this Site or other sites, click [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F).

### 2.4 From third parties

We may obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners, and other independent third-party sources, which we may combine with other information about you. As is the case with most organizations, _MetroCorp_ uses subcontractors and vendors to assist with our technology, security, payment processing, order-fulfillment, delivery, advertising/marketing, analytics, digital-development and –deployment, and other business services who, in the course of acting on our behalf, may provide us with your Personal Information. Another third party source of your Personal Information may be through social media, which depends upon your privacy settings with that third party platform. Additionally, we may receive your Personal Information if someone gifts you a subscription, if you have a subscription account through an organization (for example, your employer or school).
