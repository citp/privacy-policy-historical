</ul>

<p><span class="heading2">General Information</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>We collect some personal information when you register with the Site. At the moment,
the only personal data collected is your freely chosen user name (which, of course, doesn't have
to be your real name).</li>
<li>Beside that, the Site automatically receives and records information on our server logs
from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the page you request.</li>
<li>We use this information for the following general purposes: product and

</ul>

<p><span class="heading2">IP Addresses</span></p>

geographical regions.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<a name="fbperms"></a>
<p><span class="heading2">Facebook permissions</span></p>

<p>For Phixr to provide all its Facebook-related services, it needs permissions to access your Facebook data. Here is which permissions
are needed and what Phixr uses them for:</p>

<ul class="ab">
<li><b>"Your basic info"</b>: Phixr only uses <i>your name</i> for tagging yourself in a photo,
and the <i>list of your friends</i> for tagging them and accessing their photos. No other information
is accessed or used.</li>
<li><b>"Your Photos" and "Photos shared with you"</b>: This is for allowing Phixr to <i>download
your photos</i> from Facebook, including photo tags.</li>
<li><b>"Post on your behalf"</b>: As dangerous as this might sound, in fact, this is only needed to
<i>upload photos</i> to your albums. Phixr does not "post" anything to your wall.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can revoke all permissions from within the "Privacy" page in your Facebook account settings. If you remove
Phixr as a Facebook app, permissions are revoked as well.</p>

<p><span class="heading1">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>When you e-mail a photo, your Site user name that you are registered under
is visible to the recipient(s) of the e-mail. So is the e-mail address you
specified in your profile.</li>
<li>We do not rent or sell or share any personal information.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent,
or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including
without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
physical safety of any person, violations of the Site's Terms of Use, or as
otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if
the Site or our company is acquired by or merged with another company. In this
event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site
before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
privacy policy. We may share demographic information with business partners,
such as "12% of users who regularly use the Site are from countries that start
with 'A'" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used
without your permission.</li>
<li>The Site displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.</li>
<li>All personal information and other data will be stored and processed in the
United States and this information may be subject to the laws of this jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading1">Editing Account Information. Security.</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>You can change your Account Information, at any time.</li>
<li>We may send you certain communications relating to the Site's service, such
as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part
of your account.</li>
<li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we
believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide
products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
<li>Your Account Information is password-protected.</li>
<li>In certain areas, the Site may use SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading1">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span></p>

significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice
to the email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent
notice on our site.</p>
