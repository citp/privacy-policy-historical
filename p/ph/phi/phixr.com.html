<h1>Phixr - Edit photos online!</h1>
<p>Phixr is an <b>online photo editor</b>, a free web-based picture editing tool. You simply <b>edit your photos in your web browser</b>. This makes Phixr the ideal photo solution for internet cafes, school or office computers on which there is no photo editing software installed or installable.</p>
<p>For instance, if you're traveling and taking tons of digital pictures, you probably go crazy over how much time you waste rotating, adjusting, and de-red-eye-fying your images just so you can share them with friends and family back home. Phixr Online Photo Editor is a super-easy site that lets you store and fix images. It has all the basic and advanced photo editing features, plus some fun ones, like making your photo sepia-tone or black-and-white, adding text, adding speech-bubbles and sharpening the image. It has an undo button for those "oops, that doesn't look so great" moments. <i>Online photo manipulation</i> made really easy!</p>
<p>To the Google folks: This text is <b>not hidden</b>. You simply need to click on the "General Info" link in the page footer.</p>

<p>For more information, please see our <a href="/about" title="help" class="statusbarlink">help pages</a>.

<p><span class="heading2">Facebook permissions</span></p>

<p>For Phixr to provide all its Facebook-related services, it needs permissions to access your Facebook data. Here is which permissions
are needed and what Phixr uses them for:</p>

<ul class="ab">
<li><b>"Access my public information"</b>: Phixr only uses <i>your name</i> for tagging yourself in a photo, and the <i>list of your
friends</i> for tagging them and accessing their photos. No other information is accessed or used.</li>
<li><b>"Post to my Wall"</b>: As dangerous as this might sound, in fact, this is only needed to <i>upload photos</i> to your albums.
Phixr does not "post" anything "to your wall".</li>
<li><b>"Access my photos and videos"</b>: This is for allowing Phixr to <i>download your photos</i> from Facebook, including photo
tags. Phixr does not even touch your videos.</li>
<li><b>"Access my friends’ information"</b>: This is for accessing (speak: reading) photo tags in your photos and for being able to
<i>download your friends’ photos</i>. No other action is performed.</li>
<li><b>"Offline access"</b>: This permission is required if you use Phixr as a stand-alone website, and not from
within Facebook. Phixr also only asks for this permission if the authorization is initiated from within Phixr.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can revoke all permissions from within the "Privacy" page in your Facebook account settings. If you remove
Phixr as a Facebook app, permissions are revoked as well.</p>

<p><span class="heading1">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>When you e-mail a photo, your Site user name that you are registered under
is visible to the recipient(s) of the e-mail. So is the e-mail address you
specified in your profile.</li>
<li>We do not rent or sell or share any personal information.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent,
or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including
without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
physical safety of any person, violations of the Site's Terms of Use, or as
otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if
the Site or our company is acquired by or merged with another company. In this
event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site
before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
privacy policy. We may share demographic information with business partners,
such as "12% of users who regularly use the Site are from countries that start
with 'A'" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used
without your permission.</li>
<li>The Site displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.</li>
<li>All personal information and other data will be stored and processed in the
United States and this information may be subject to the laws of this jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading1">Editing Account Information. Security.</span></p>

<li>We may send you certain communications relating to the Site's service, such
as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part
of your account.</li>
<li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we
believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide
products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
