## Privacy Notice for PhilHealth Website

In carrying out its mandate under Republic Act (RA) No. 7875, as amended by RAs 9241 and 10606, which relates to the administration of the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP), the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (“PhilHealth or “We”) collects and processes personal data, including those sourced from its official website.
