**Cookies**  
The Museum uses technology known as "cookies" to track usage patterns, traffic trends and user behavior, as well as to record other information from the website. For certain services provided on this website, cookies allow us to save information locally so that you will not have to re-enter it the next time you visit. Many content adjustments and customer service improvements are made based on the data derived from cookies. The information we collect from cookies will not be used to create profiles of users and will only be used in aggregate form. Users should be aware that the museum contracts with third party vendors for services that require the sharing of non-personally identifiable information collected via cookies. 

You may set your browser to refuse cookies. If you so choose, you may still gain access to most of the Museum website, but you may not be able to conduct certain types of transactions (such as shopping) or take advantage of some of the interactive elements offered.

If you would like more information about cookies and the option not to have them used by third-party companies during your visit to the PMA website, you may visit: <http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml>. 

In addition to using cookies and related technologies as described above, we also may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on our Sites and/or Services (e.g., to allow them to tailor ads on third party services). These companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.

If you send us personal information—by submitting an e-mail, completing an online form or survey, requesting materials or information, ordering merchandise or Museum tickets, making a donation or signing up for membership—we will use this information to respond to your inquiry or request. We may also use it to contact you to provide information about other Museum activities, programs, membership and fundraising opportunities, products and special events that may interest you.

**Transactions**  
_Purchasing Tickets/Web Ticketing_  
The Museum provides visitors with the opportunity to purchase tickets, programs, and membership online. When visitors to the Museum website choose to purchase tickets online, they are linked to a website powered by Accesso Passport, allowing us to efficiently automate the selling and allocating of tickets in real-time. Visitors to the Accesso Passport website are covered by the museum’s policy. 

_Museum Store and Online Membership_  
The Museum provides visitors with an opportunity to make online purchases from the Museum retail store as well as purchase a Museum membership. When visitors to the Museum website choose to make an online purchase or to become a member of the Museum, they are linked to a website powered by Mi9. You may browse the PMA's online shop without registering or submitting personally identifiable information. 

When you order a product from the PMA Online Store, the PMA will collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information to process your order. This information is subject to the "Sending Us Personal Information" section above. The PMA will retain minimal personal identity information for our records, to facilitate better customer service, keep you up-to-date on your order status and to inform you of future products and promotions. 

If you choose to register at our Online Store, the PMA will request the same personally identifiable information used to process an order (which includes your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address). This information is used to create a more personalized experience for you each time you visit. With registration, you will be able to keep items in a shopping cart for review or purchase at a later date, view a history of your past orders, and experience a faster checkout. If you need to change any of the information that you provided, you can safely update it any time you log in or it can be permanently removed if you contact us via the above email or postal mail address. 

Your personal information may be stored by Mi9. More information on Mi9’s privacy policy can be viewed at <http://mi9retail.com/privacy-policy/>.

The Museum is concerned about protecting children's privacy. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. There are some areas within the Philadelphia Museum of Art website where children could post messages or provide feedback, but children are discouraged from providing personal information. If a visitor known to be a child under the age of 13 sends an e-mail to the Museum, we will only use it to respond to the writer and not to create profiles or otherwise retain the information.
