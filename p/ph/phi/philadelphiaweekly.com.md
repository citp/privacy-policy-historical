## Information we collect

RP collects information about our subscribers’ use of the Service in order to provide a secure and personalized experience. We collect both Personal Information, such as email addresses, passwords, and user ids; and demographic information, such as zip codes, state of residence and dates of birth. The following list includes the different types of information we collect.

**Personal Information**  “Personal Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact You, including, for example, Your e-mail address. Personal Information does not include aggregated information or information about You that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons. For example, statistics about how many persons visited our Web site last month is not Personal Information.

**Non-personally Identifiable Information**  “Non-personally Identifiable Information” is anonymous information about You that does not include Your name or contact information. For instance, the links that You save and share via the Service is Non-personally Identifiable Information. We use this information to customize the Service for You and will not include or refer to Personal Information, such as Your e-mail address, when using this type of data. For example, you might be saving pages about beer. Based on this information, we may deliver advertisements related to beer.

**Aggregated Information**  “Aggregated Information” refers to information we gather by aggregating Non-personally Identifiable Information to provide a summary of our subscribers. We use Aggregated Information to show usage patterns and to do such things as operate our site or negotiate with vendors. Examples of such aggregated data would be an IP address, browser type or access time. Such Information is not linked to Your Personal Information.
