Facebook permissions

For Phixr to provide all its Facebook-related services, it needs permissions to access your Facebook data. Here is which permissions are needed and what Phixr uses them for:

  * **"Your basic info"** : Phixr only uses _your name_ for tagging yourself in a photo, and the _list of your friends_ for tagging them and accessing their photos. No other information is accessed or used.
  * **"Your Photos" and "Photos shared with you"** : This is for allowing Phixr to _download your photos_ from Facebook, including photo tags.
  * **"Post on your behalf"** : As dangerous as this might sound, in fact, this is only needed to _upload photos_ to your albums. Phixr does not "post" anything to your wall.



You can revoke all permissions from within the "Privacy" page in your Facebook account settings. If you remove Phixr as a Facebook app, permissions are revoked as well.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * When you e-mail a photo, your Site user name that you are registered under is visible to the recipient(s) of the e-mail. So is the e-mail address you specified in your profile.
  * We do not rent or sell or share any personal information.
  * It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Site's Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if the Site or our company is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share demographic information with business partners, such as "12% of users who regularly use the Site are from countries that start with 'A'" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission.
