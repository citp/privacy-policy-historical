The Services and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “embedded scripts”, “web beacons” and other tracking and logging technologies (collectively, “Logging Technologies”) to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with and otherwise use the Services, as well as to collect such information over time and across different websites that are associated with such third parties; such activities will be in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including without limitation its Section 4.4 below.

We may associate the information obtained through these Logging Technologies with your Personal Information so we can better customize your experience using the Services and/or the advertisements and promotions you see. By accessing and/or using the Services, whether as a guest, a registered user, or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to store your activities and your use of the Services as described in this Privacy Policy.
