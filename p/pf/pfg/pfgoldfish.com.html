<b>Pepperidge Farm, Inc. Privacy Policy</b><br>

This website is owned and operated by Pepperidge Farm Incorporated. Here at
Pepperidge Farm, we recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about
the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. So
we've developed a Privacy Policy based on guidelines from the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) and our own beliefs about what's right in this
sensitive area. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check
in occasionally.<p>


If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:</p><p>

<b>Our Policy</b><br>
At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from
individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.  This
means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order
to view our site. If you register in order to use the "Mariner's Mailbox" feature
of our site, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the services
you've requested. The information obtained from visitors to the Goldfish Hideaway is also used so we may improve the site and provide a more useful and enjoyable experience for our online audience. If you specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our mailing list when you registered, we may also contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by
emailing us at any time. We don't share any information you give us with
anyone outside of Pepperidge Farm, Inc.</p><p>

In the email section of our site, we ask for some personally identifiable
information, such as your name, email address, and phone number. Pepperidge Farm values the privacy of all users and therefore does not sell email addresses or other information obtained. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to
contact you by email were unsuccessful. We don't use the information
internally for other purposes, and we don't share it with anyone outside of
Pepperidge Farm, Inc.  We don't use your email address for any purpose
other than responding to the message you've sent.</p><p>

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we
are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases.
If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of
conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). Visitors who provide such information to Pepperidge Farm may occasionally receive email updates about new features, services, or products on the site. Furthermore, we don't share the information you give us with anyone outside of Pepperidge Farm, Inc.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. When you
log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new
visitor. The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or
provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any
information from your computer.</p><p>
