We may carry out this processing of your personal information ourselves or we may engage agents and processors to perform some of these functions for us.</p>

 
<p>
We also may transfer your data or permit selected third parties use of your data so they may provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you, and both we and they may contact you about these by mail, telephone or email.  These third parties will usually be exhibitors at our trade shows, participants in our trade conferences or awards, or advertisers in the publications and online products  in which you have expressed an interest, particularly those whose products and services might align with your interests.  When we share your personal data with these third parties, they will be responsible for protecting your data once they receive it.
