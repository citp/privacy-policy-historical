# PMI Privacy Policy | Project Management Institute

PMI is recognized as the world's leading project management professional association. We strive to provide our members and customers with the top products and services available and recognize that building a long-term business relationship with you depends a great deal on trust. This trust begins with our commitment to respecting as well as protecting your privacy and in furtherance of this goal PMI acknowledges that it respects the privacy rights of its members and customer and will comply with all applicable privacy laws in the countries in which PMI does business.

We have structured our web site so that, in general, you can visit PMI on the web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) you can be assured that it will only be used to support your member/customer relationship with PMI. Our membership application process, registration process for seminars, certification and educational programs, Marketplace, and Career Headquarters may request and/or require you to submit personal information. However, you can be assured that any such personal information that you submit to PMI will be protected by industry standard security and management procedures and will be used only for the purpose for which it was submitted, unless you request or agree otherwise.

Our privacy statement covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Access & Correction, Security, and Additional Web Site Issues.

**1\. Awareness**

PMI provides this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**What Information We Collect**

On PMI's web sites, over the telephone, or through the mail, you are able to order products or services from PMI, apply for PMI membership, and register for seminars, courses, and certification. The types of personal information collected by PMI may include your name, your employer and job title, your contact and billing information for business and home (including telephone number and e-mail address), and your credit card information (if applicable). In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences.

**Information Collected Through Technology**

When you use any of our web sites or services, we or our service providers may collect tracking information such as your browser type, mobile device, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the web sites. We use this information for aggregate reporting. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our web sites or which pages or features get the most attention. We use this information to make our web sites and other products and services more useful to you; to provide you with more effective customer service; to make the web sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and to display content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.  (See Section 5, Additional Web Site Issues, for more information about technologies used to collect information about user activity on PMI web sites.)

**How We Use the Information**

PMI uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete transactions requested by you, to communicate back to you, and to offer and update you on PMI services and benefits. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.

As a benefit to PMI members and certificants, PMI will (at no charge) include your name and relevant biographical information in PMI directories. From time to time, we may also desire to contact you for market research purposes or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. PMI will not reveal your personal information publicly or to any third party (except as stated below), unless we receive your explicit permission to do so. For example, the PMI membership application includes a question asking if you want your name included in mailing lists, PMI announcement lists and PMI directories. Your name will not be used for any such purpose unless you affirmatively request PMI to do so. In addition, if at any time you would like to have your name removed from PMI lists and/or directories, please follow the directions given below in the "Choice" section (Section 2) of this document to opt-out of such contact.

**With Whom We Share the Information**

PMI will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others without your permission. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide to us with other PMI entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to help us provide you with our products and services. Such PMI entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by this Privacy Policy and applicable confidentiality agreements.

**2\. Choice**

PMI will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us for purposes other than for which the information was originally submitted, without your express permission. We will also provide you the opportunity to inform us at any time if you choose to opt-out of partial or total contact from PMI and we will comply with such requests. This choice regarding communications from PMI may be offered on our membership and certification applications, registration forms or web pages, or at the bottom of online or off-line communications from us. If you have any difficulty exercising your choices, please send your request to privacy@pmi.org. You may also exercise your choices by contacting PMI by phone at +1-610-356-4600, option 8 (Customer Care) or by mail at Project Management Institute, Inc., Fourteen Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073, Attention: D. Murray, Privacy Officer. Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and not governed by our privacy policy.

**3\. Access & Correction**

PMI strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We will provide you with access to your information, including making every effort to provide you with online or telephone access to your registration data so that you may review, update or correct your personal information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. If you are a PMI member, you can access your personal information by logging into My PMI with your user ID and password, following the directions listed under "Change Personal Information." You may also request a change in your personal information by contacting Customer Care either by e-mail at customercare@pmi.org; or by telephone at +1-610-356-4600, then select option 8 and following the instructions provided thereafter.

**4\. Security**

PMI is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.   We use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your sensitive credit or debit card information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which creates an encrypted connection between you and our systems for the transmission of any credit or debit card information you input online and we use encryption protection for any payment authorizations for transactions we request through any channel. Once we collect your credit card or debit card information, it is stored encrypted on restricted-access computers that are not directly accessible via the Internet. 

Any unauthorized access to or use of any of our web sites and other products and services or to the information collected and maintained by us should be immediately brought to our attention by contacting us via email at [privacy@pmi.org](mailto:privacy@pmi.org) or by writing to us at Project Management Institute, Attn: Security, 14 Campus Blvd, Newtown Square, PA 19073. We will investigate, and, if necessary, take action to halt any violation of the security of your personal information of which we become aware. 

Your access to some services and content is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PMI will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. You should not disclose your user name and password to others. In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of your PMI account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our best efforts to protect your personal information, PMI cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

**5\. Additional Web Site Issues**

(a) How PMI Uses Technology to Improve Your Web Site Experience

PMI uses  cookies and web beacons (described [below](http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx#cookies)), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses. We also deliver advertisements  and provide web site analytics tools on non-PMI sites and services, and we may collect information about page views on these third party sites as well.

Most aggregate information is collected via cookies, web beacons and other technical methods. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs), in conjunction with cookies, are used to compile statistics about site usage. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites or applications. We or our service providers use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our web sites and to measure site effectiveness or use of online products and services. We also use Web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send our visitors who have agreed to receive e-mail from us, to determine whether our recipients have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish PMI with personally identifiable information, this information can be associated to the data stored in the cookies or Web beacons. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to our service providers. These technical methods allow us to make our web sites and other products and services, and any e-mails you have agreed to receive, more interesting to you. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. 

We also use cookies to store, and sometimes to track, user information. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering or subscribing to our web sites. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our web sites to recognize your computer. We use both temporary and persistent cookies; a temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and it expires when you close your browser. We use them to provide continuity for your visit as you visit web site pages. Persistent cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you are a subscriber) so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit. The Help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various features on our Sites that are available to other visitors. 

PMI wants to ensure that you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We are aware that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our customers, so we respect these concerns. PMI works to continuously improve the pmi.org web experience and personal data privacy policy and practices.

(b) Links to Third Party Websites

Links to third party web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the PMI site. PMI has not comprehensively reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policies. Thus, PMI does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do this entirely at your own risk.

**6\. Enforcement/Contact Information**

If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices, please contact PMI at privacy@pmi.org. Douglas Murray, Esq., Manager, Legal Compliance, is the authorized privacy officer for PMI. PMI is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. Any disputes arising out of a breach of this policy will be submitted to and resolved by the privacy dispute resolution procedure set up by the Direct Marketing Association.

**7\. Changes to this Statement**

If there are updates to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes and update the revision date listed on this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have. For material changes to this Policy, PMI will provide notification to affected customers.
