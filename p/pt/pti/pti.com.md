 **Passive Collection**

As is true of most websites and online services, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.

We use this information to help us evaluate and improve our Website or PTI Software, analyze trends, track User’s movements around the Website, and for marketing and investment analysis. We may share this information with third parties in aggregate statistical form that includes no Personal Data.

 **Cookies and Tracking Technologies**

PTI and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. To manage Flash cookies, please click here: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>

 **How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals**

Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the websites and other online services with which your web browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard is established, we may revise our policy on responding to these signals.

 **Marketing and Analytics Companies**

We partner with a third party to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, click here [http://preferences-mgr.truste.com](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)  or <http://pages.marcom.com/Update-Your-Preferences.html>. If you’re located in the European Union, click here [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) . Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

We may work with certain third-party analytics companies that collect information and report website trends without identifying individual visitors. These services allow us to view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with the Website, so we can improve the Website and understand how people find and navigate it. Currently, we work with Google Analytics. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list and we may stop working with this company and work with others without notice. You can learn more about how these companies collect, use and share information about you by visiting their websites.

 **Security**

PTI uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect the Website and PTI Software and to prevent unauthorized access, use, and disclosure of Customer Information. Users have a password that must be used each time a User logs-in to the PTI Software or the Website. Users may change their password at any time. PTI strongly urges Users not to share their passwords with others, and not to use the same password(s) that you use on the Website and PTI Software with other online services. Also, PTI strongly recommends that each User log-out completely after User is finished using the PTI Software or Website. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and every system that allows online access is potentially vulnerable to outside attacks from unauthorized third parties. As a result, while PTI strives to protect Customer Information, PTI can’t and doesn’t guarantee or warrant the security of any Customer Information which User transmits to PTI, and User does so entirely at User’s own risk.

 **Linked Sites**

Our Website and PTI Software may link to other web sites not controlled by PTI. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any other web sites, and you acknowledge and agree that any visits to or use of such other web sites is entirely at your own risk. You should carefully review the privacy and security practices of the other web sites before you provide such web sites with any of your Customer Information.

 **Processor Policy**

PTI collects information under the direction of its Clients and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer Personal Data to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

PTI acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to PTI’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain personal data that we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. PTI will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

For questions relating to Personal Data policies, or to opt-in or opt- out of specific communications from PTI, contact PTI at the email address inquiries@marcom.com or the mailing address set forth below.
