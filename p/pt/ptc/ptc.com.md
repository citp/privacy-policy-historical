### PTC Statement of Privacy

PTC understands that your privacy is important. We have implemented this Data Privacy Policy with respect to information that we collect from you over the web and while providing software or services to you. We want to inform you of our Privacy Policy and to ensure you that we are taking steps to make sure that the information you give us is secure. 

**PTC only collects information to provide you with products, services and related information.**  
PTC only collects information which you provide to us in the course of ordering or obtaining support for PTC products and services, at our web site PTC.com or at PTC marketing and sales events. You are generally free to provide only such information as you determine, however, certain offerings will require that you provide specific data (e.g. for online support you must provide an email address). In order to improve the content of PTC.com, PTC tracks the amount of time you spend browsing PTC.com and the pages you visited. PTC.com does recognise your domain name but does not automatically collect personal information about you. PTC also collects aggregate information on what pages of PTC.com are visited. However, no personal information is collected unless volunteered through mechanisms such as surveys or registrations. 

PTC utilizes "Cookies" in order to make PTC.com more user friendly and to provide enhanced and customized features during your visits to PTC.com. Cookies are small bits of data that are sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies permit PTC.com to recognize your user name and e-mail address but do not collect your personal information. PTC does not mandate Cookies for you to access PTC.com and you may freely set your browser to reject all Cookies or prompt you to accept or reject them. 

**You can refuse to give us personal information**  
For certain areas of PTC.com, PTC requests registration information from you and you are free to provide this information or deny the request. If you do not provide this information, you will still be able to access most of PTC.com. However, you will not be able to access certain areas and/or services offered on PTC.com 

**We restrict access to your personal information**  
It is PTC's policy that the information you provide to PTC is not distributed to third parties for their use or sale. In certain circumstances PTC may provide your information to third parties, such as upon your consent, when PTC reasonably believes that it is required to do so by law, or to certain business partners or service providers in the course of providing you with information, products or services. It is PTC's policy to never sell your information to list brokers or agents for commercial gain. 

PTC will use the information that you provide in order to better service you with respect to PTC products and services that are available from time to time. PTC may also notify you of updates to PTC.com and of special events or new product offerings that PTC or its business partners may introduce. These may be in the form of e-mails or mailings. PTC permits you to opt-out of certain uses of your information when you initially provide personal information and at a later date if you so request. 

**You can correct the information we collect**  
You may access the data that PTC.com has recorded and update or correct the information at any time. You may send an email to [web_info@ptc.com](mailto:web_info@ptc.com) to determine what information has been recorded or to request opt-out information. In the near future, you will be able to visit a web page on PTC.com that will provide the capability to immediately review and correct recorded information. 

**We protect the information you give us**  
PTC will take reasonable steps necessary to protect the information you provide to us. We continually review our security procedures and mechanisms to ensure that adequate protections are in place.
