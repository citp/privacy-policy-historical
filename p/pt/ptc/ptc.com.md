### YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF E-MAIL CORRESPONDENCE AND ACCESS AND CORRECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data ("opt-out"). We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) how we intend to use your data or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for the purpose for which it was collected. You can exercise your opt-out right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data as well as a later time as described below. Similarly, our Quality Agent functionality in certain of our software products may be configured to opt-out of data collection (this may not be available in free versions of our software so to opt-out you simply do not download and use that free software).

Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to personal data about you in our possession, and will take reasonable steps to permit you to correct, amend, or delete personal data that you demonstrate to be inaccurate or incomplete.

If you have a PTC.com online account you may access the data that PTC.com has recorded and update or correct the information at any time. You may also opt-out of future correspondence by updating your preferences. To do this go to [www.ptc.com](https://web.archive.org/) and under Customer Resources visit ptc.com accounts. If you don't have an account or are unable to locate your account information, you can create one or you may request a copy of the personal data we have stored and/or exercise your opt-out right by contacting [dataupdate@ptc.com](mailto:dataupdate@ptc.com). When updating personal data about you, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

You may also opt-out of future correspondence by updating your preferences using the link on the footer of e-mail correspondence.

You can also correct the information we have about you and/or exercise the opt-out right at any time by contacting us at [dataprivacy@ptc.com](mailto:%20dataprivacy@ptc.com). When updating personal data about you, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

We may reject requests that are fraudulent, unreasonably repetitious, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), or would be extremely impractical (for example, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so at no cost to you, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to protect information from accidental or malicious alteration or destruction. Accordingly, after your information is deleted, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers or remove information from our backup systems.

### DATA INTEGRITY

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data about you is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. You are responsible for the accuracy of all personal data you provide to us. We will use reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the personal data we obtain, and to update it as appropriate. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use.

### SECURITY

We have implemented, and will maintain current, reasonable physical, technical, and organizational security measures for the purpose of protecting the personal data in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we have security measures in place to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our sites; any transmission is at your own risk.
