These groups would use the information to track the electronic interactions back to the source computer(s) or account(s).

Some Web pages at Prairie View A&M University may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above. Each Web page that collects information will have a separate privacy statement that will tell you how that information is used.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your use of this Web site, please contact the Webmaster.
