</p><h3>Links?</h3> 

<p>The PediaNetwork® Web sites contain links to other websites on the Internet or World Wide Web. Please be aware that we, the PediaNetwork® and PEDIA, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Websites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the PediaNetwork® Web sites. 
<br><br>
Be aware that PediaNetwork® sponsors and other advertisers have links on the Network that take you to external sites. Some of these sites may collect personally identifiable information from you, and third-party advertising networks for PediaNetwork® may use "cookies" and "Web beacons" in their advertisements to collect certain information from you. While PediaNetwork® hopes that all third parties involved adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users, the PediaNetwork® Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and the PediaNetwork® does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties. 
<br><br>

</p><h3>Cookies and Web beacons?</h3> 

<p>In addition to the personally identifiable information that the PediaNetwork® actively collects when you register, we also may collect anonymous information passively using <strong>cookies</strong> and <strong>Web beacons</strong>. These technologies play an important role in making the Internet work, but there is much confusion about what cookies and Web beacons are and how they are used. 
<br><br>
A COOKIE is a small file that contains a unique identification code that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer to identify your computer and passively track its activities as you progress through a Web site. This unique code identifies your Web browser to our computer system whenever you visit a PediaNetwork® site. A cookie will not allow a Web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, phone number, etc.) that you have not otherwise overtly disclosed. 
<br><br>
Cookies allow the PediaNetwork® to automatically remember your Web browser when you visit a PediaNetwork® Web site. To help serve you better, the PediaNetwork® uses cookies in the following manner: 
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Enabling the PediaNetwork® to deliver products and services more efficiently</strong> - by maintaining registration and preference information in cookies, the PediaNetwork® can deliver products and services that use such information more quickly and efficiently for more users. This information is normally saved in an encrypted form that only the PediaNetwork® can utlizie.</li>

<li><strong>Statistics</strong> - such as audience size, unique visitors, page views and traffic patterns. This information is collected in aggregate form ONLY and will is not linked to any of your personally identifiable information.</li>

<li><strong>Preventing unauthorized access to your account</strong>. On some PediaNetwork® sites, cookies help us determine that only one user is logged on under the same username and/or password at any given time.</li>

<li><strong>Marketing demographics</strong>. - cookies let the PediaNetwork® know whether or not a Web browser has seen a particular page, ad, or link and log the number of exposures displayed to a particular browser. The PediaNetwork® also use cookies to customize the information you see based on non-personally identifiable demographic information that you provide when you register and as you browse through the PediaNetwork®.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cookies are now an industry standard, and are currently used throughout the Internet. You may customize your Web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is set, to ask you permission to set a cookie, or to always refuse cookies. While the PediaNetwork® does not require users to enable cookies, certain sites and services will not function as effectively or efficiently if users set their browsers to always refuse cookies. 
A Web beacon, which utilize clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that the PediaNetwork® may place on Web pages and within email newsletters that. These Web beacons, along with cookies, enable the PediaNetwork® to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page on the PediaNetwork®, the number of times a particular page is displayed, or how many people opened a email newsletter. Such information is can only bo collected in aggregate form and is not linked to any personal information. 

Cookies and Web beacons enable the PediaNetwork® to offer services and products that consumers deisre and to efficiently determine what information is in greatest demand, while enabling the effective and efficient use of a visitor's time whiel browsing a PediaNetwork® site. While users are free to set their browsers to refuse all cookies, thereby also effectively disabling the Web beacons, there are various services that would be adversely affected.
