**Information Collection and Use**  
PG is the owner of the information collected on the Sites covered by this Privacy Statement. In order to use full functionality offered by the Sites, a user may be required to provide certain personal information (such as job title and email address) asides from providing information about personal feedback, perceptions, or assessments. We use this information to score individual or team feedback reports in subjects such as, but not limit to, Communication Skills, Leadership and Management Development, Performance Development, Personality Profiles. Sometimes, it is required for the user to provide demographic information (such as job level and gender) in some of our on-line surveys and this practice is necessary so we can provide a more personalized assessment analysis for the users, or be able to average perceptions or experience scores for each and all demographic groups.  
**Profiles**  
Information provided by users of the Sites is stored in a user profile in our database. Subsequently collected information related to that user profile that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties is tied to the profile to improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to the Sites and to direct pertinent content to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site except when personal information is stored on a voluntary basis through the process of logging into the Web Site with a user name and password, in which case the information can be used to pre-populate user information into form fields presented by the Web Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies in the PG Internet Sites.  
**Sharing  
**Though we make industry standard and reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Sites. We do not share personal information with Third Parties except as otherwise noted in this Statement.  
**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to `opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Sites at the point where we ask for information. Users who provide information requested by the Sites, or who continue to use the Sites after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Statement, thereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Statement and to PG's use of the information it collects as described in this Privacy Statement. Those who do not agree to this Privacy Statement may not use the Site.   
Users of the Sites are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.  
**Security  
**The Sites take industry standard and reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Sites, their information is protected both online and offline.  
When registration or order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or user ID/password ), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, (we also provide reasonable and timely effort to protect user-information offline). All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Those employees are required to respect the confidentiality of our visitor's personal data.   
The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility.  
Changes to the Privacy Statement  
We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web Site (home page) for 14 days.
