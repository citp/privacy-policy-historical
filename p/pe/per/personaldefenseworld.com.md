“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site.

**Security**

Harris Publications will not be liable for disclosures of your Personally Identifiable Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. We have undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to visitor data retained in our internal servers **.** We also store Personally Identifiable Information in certain third party external databases (such as Progress Openedge) that we reasonably believe comply with generally accepted industry standards to protect Personally Identifiable Information.

Additionally, we use the Symantec SSL Certificate standard to verify the secure nature of our Site to users’ browsers.

Despite the measures we take to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk. You must accept all risks associated with any data transmission, including the risk that your Personally Identifiable Information may be intercepted in transit.

We retain non-personally identifiable information collected via our Service for as long as we have a business reason to do so. After that time, we aggregate the data and retain it for analytical purposes. We retain your Personally Identifiable Information for as long as your Service participation is active (as determined by us), including when your magazine subscription is active, and for a reasonable time thereafter (in the event that you choose to engage with us again). We also may retain your Personally Identifiable Information for a longer period of time as needed to provide you services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information, we may continue to retain and use aggregate, anonymous data previously collected and/or anonymize and aggregate your Personally Identifiable Information.
