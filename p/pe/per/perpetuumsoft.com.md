We encourage you to read this privacy policy to ensure you understand Perpetuum Software’s privacy practices. 

**Collection of your personal information**

When Perpetuum Software collects any personal information on our corporate website, we will express our need for the personal data at the point of collection. Some of the reasons why we collect your personal information include: 

**Accessing and updating your personal information**

We need your help in keeping the personal information you have shared with us accurate and up to date. Please notify us of any changes to your personal information. 

**Unsubscribing**

Subscriptions to some newsletters can be managed through the Perpetuum Software website. In addition, each email newsletter includes instructions on how you can unsubscribe from that particular mailing. 

**Non-personal information collection**

In some instances, Perpetuum Software may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of the perpetuumsoft.com website. 

**Sharing your personal information**

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third-parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so. 

We may share your personal information within Perpetuum Software for purposes of data processing or storage. 

We may also share your personal information with authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction. 

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

We may collect and possibly share personal information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Perpetuum Software's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

We will ask you for your opt-in consent to share your personal information with a third party for any other reason.
