* **Limiting the Collection of Personal Data**

PSMA limits its collection of Data to only that information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes. PSMA does not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any Data from children under the age of thirteen.

When you visit the PSMA website, a Cookie may be placed on your computer or the Cookie may be read if you have visited the PSMA site previously. PSMA uses Cookies to allow PSMA to determine which products and services you have already purchased so that PSMA does not provide redundant information to you and, if you are a PSMA affiliate, to track PSMA sales made to customers referred by you so that you can receive compensation under our affiliate program.

If you choose not to have your browser accept Cookies from the PSMA website, you may not be able to view all the text on the screens, or to experience a personalized visit, or to subscribe to certain service and product offerings on the PSMA site.

* **Disclosure, Processing and Retention**

PSMA does not sell or rent your Data to anyone else. PSMA will disclose your Data only as follows:

  1. to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 4, above);
  2. a very limited amount, and in very few cases, to PSMA’s employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on PSMA’s behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;
  3. as necessary if PSMA has reason to believe that disclosure is required in order to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with PSMA’s rights or property, other users of PSMA’s website, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
  4. to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.



In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. In such transactions, Data may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that PSMA or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your Data may be one of the transferred assets.

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States, or in any other country in which PSMA or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. The information we collect from you is processed by staff who may engage in the processing of your payment details. By submitting your Data to PSMA, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your information.

After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from our database), PSMA will keep your personally identifiable Data in its archives, unless you request that PSMA delete all data in your account. PSMA will comply with this request, except to retain whatever personally identifiable Data is legally necessary for compliance with applicable law in the United States. Whatever information remains in our archives will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove PSMA’s compliance with any applicable law.

* **Accuracy of Personal Data**

PSMA will use reasonable efforts to keep customer Data accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information. Customers are responsible for informing PSMA about changes to their Data. PSMA will use new or updated Data it receives from customers to update its own records.

* **Security Safeguards**

PSMA takes all reasonably necessary steps to ensure that your Data is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. All Data which you provide to PSMA is stored on secure servers. Any financial transactions are carried out on secure sites.

However, the transfer of information via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your Data as it is transmitted to our websites. Therefore any transaction is made at your own risk.

We ask that you keep confidential any passwords that admit you to certain parts of our websites, not sharing those passwords with anyone.

* **Access to Personal Data**

Customers may check their Data to verify, update or correct it, and to have any obsolete information removed. You can also ask to review any of your personally identifiable Data that we have retained, how we have used it, and to whom we have disclosed it at any time by contacting PSMA as indicated below.

Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, and provided we can authenticate your identity, you will be given reasonable access to your personally identifiable Data and will be entitled to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and to have it amended as appropriate.

You may also ask PSMA to change your preferences regarding how we use or disclose your information, or let PSMA know that you do not wish to receive any further communication from us.

PSMA will afford you a reasonable opportunity to review the Data in your file, if you so request by writing to:

805 Lake Street #295  
Oak Park, Illinois 60301 USA

   
Or [privacy@perrymarshall.com](mailto:privacy@perrymarshall.com)

If PSMA is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customer’s personally identifiable Data, it will provide reasons for denying access, such as that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney/client privileged communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.

Customers have the right to request that their personally identifiable Data be removed from PSMA’s database or that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate, by contacting PSMA at the end of the Privacy Policy document. PSMA will promptly take action on customer’s request.

Customers may also use the same means of contact to report to PSMA any violation of statute or regulation governing the operation of websites which has affected customers.

* **Policies of Partners and Affiliates**

PSMA’s websites may contain links to and from partner or affiliate websites. Please note that these websites have their own privacy and cookies policies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for these websites or their policies.

PSMA reserves the right to make changes to this Policy at any time by giving notice on this page (or at another location specified here) of any such changes or revisions. PSMA strongly recommends checking this page often, referring to the date of the last update listed at the top.
