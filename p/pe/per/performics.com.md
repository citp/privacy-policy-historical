# Privacy Policy | Performics

This Website is provided by Performics. We take the privacy of our users and their personal information very seriously.

For your convenience, all Performics Websites contain links to a number of other Websites, both inside and outside Performics & Publicis Groupe. The privacy policies and procedures described here do not apply to those sites; we suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the principles governing our use of personal information that we may obtain about you. By using the site, or by registering as a user of the services that we provide, you agree to this use. We ask you to read this privacy policy carefully. Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this policy, the data protection notice (if any) incorporated into this Website and the provisions of US laws. We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version that will apply each time you access this site.

We will not otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide at this site to any third party unless otherwise disclosed to you.

**Non-personal information collection and use**  
Similar to most commercial organizations, we monitor the use of this site by collecting aggregate information. We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use, the pages you visit or the Website which directed you to our site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is used only to assist us in providing an effective service on this website.

**Use of cookies**  
Cookies are small files which are sent to your web browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Their purpose is to help analyze web traffic.

This Website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable data from or about any person under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old and wish to ask a question or use this site in any way which requires you to submit your personal information, please get your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf.

**Security of your personal data**  
We have implemented technologies and policies with the objective of protecting your privacy from unauthorized access and improper use and will update these measures as appropriate as new technologies become available.

Under data protection law you have a right to request access to personal data which are held about you on payment of a small fee. You also have the right to require any inaccuracies in your information to be corrected free of charge.
