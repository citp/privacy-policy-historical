#### 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR SITE

**Information You Provide To Us**

When you use the Site, we or our service providers may collect Personal Information (information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally) such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mobile phone number, or mailing address.

**Information Collected Automatically**

_Usage Information_. Whenever you visit or interact with the Site, Performics, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Site is accessed and used (“ **Usage Information** ”). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. This information helps us keep our website fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests.

_Device Identifiers_. Performics may also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “ **Device** ”) you use to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Site, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

_Cookies; Pixel Tags_. The technologies used on the Site to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Site and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Site (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information). A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server. ** _
