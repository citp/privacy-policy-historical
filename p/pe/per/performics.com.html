						<a name="1"></a><b>P3P Statement for Performics' Web Site</b><br>
						Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is an emerging industry standard that provides an automated way for a consumer's browser to read and interpret a Web site's privacy policy and compare it to the consumer's own set of privacy preferences. The goal of P3P is not to eliminate or reduce the exchange of personal data, but to increase user trust and confidence in the Web through an easy process that helps users be informed about Web site practices.<br><br>

Importantly, P3P's implementation has been facilitated with the launch of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6.0, which was released in September. With Internet Explorer powering 80 percent of the browser market, it is important that Internet vendors and services providers be able to accommodate and fulfill P3P needs.<br><br>

Performics has always been and continues to be committed to safeguarding privacy. We have converted our existing privacy policy to a machine-readable format so that a user's browser can read it automatically. This will ensure that all Performics' services are fully compliant with P3P. This change will not affect the way that Performics provides its services, and our ConnectCommerce<sup class="bodysmall">SM</sup> tracking solution will be unaffected.

						<a name="2"></a><b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
						Performics will not sell, share, or rent information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Performics collects different types of information from three different types of parties: its client marketers ("Clients"), its distribution partners ("Partners") and end-customers of its Clients when those customers are referred to the Clients by way of the Partners.
						</p>
						<p class="body">
						Partners must register on Performics' ConnectCommerce<sup class="bodysmall">SM</sup> web site <a href="http://www.connectcommerce.com">(http://www.connectcommerce.com/)</a>. 
					   Clients are registered by Performics upon closing of a relationship 
					   agreement with the Client. End customers are never registered 
					   on the Performics web site.

						<p class="body">
					</p><blockquote>
	              <p class="body"><b>Registration</b><br>
	                To participate in the ConnectCommerce<sup class="bodysmall">SM</sup> web site 
						 network, a Partner must first complete the registration form. During 
	                registration, the Partner is required to give their contact information 
	                (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact
	                the Partner about relationships with Clients in which they have 
	                expressed interest. End customers do not register on any of Performics' 
						 web sites.</p>
	              <p class="body"><b>Order</b><br>
	                Performics does not collect personally identifiable information when an 
	                end customer places an order with one of our Clients. When an 
	                order takes place as a result of a referral from our Partners, 
	                we collect generic order data, such as total order amount, so that 
	                we can ensure that our Partners are compensated for their referrals.</p>
