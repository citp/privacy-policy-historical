**USES AND DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION**

**Your Authorization**. Except as outlined below, we will not use or disclose your personal health information for any purpose unless you have signed a form authorizing the use or disclosure. You have the right to revoke that authorization in writing unless we have taken any action in reliance on the authorization. There are certain uses and disclosures of your personal health information for which we will always obtain a prior authorization and these include:

  * **Marketing communications** unless the communication is made directly to you in person,  is simply a promotional gift of nominal value, is a prescription refill reminder, general health or wellness information,  or a communication about  health related  products  or services that we offer or that are directly related to your treatment.
  * **Most sales** of your health information unless for treatment or payment purposes or as required by law.
  *   **Psychotherapy notes** unless otherwise permitted or required by law **.**



** ** **Treatment**

We will make uses and disclosures of your personal health information as necessary to provide, coordinate or manage your health care and related services. For instance, doctors, nurses and other professionals involved in your care will use information in your medical record and information that you provide about your symptoms and reactions to plan a course of treatment for you that may include procedures, medications, tests, etc. We may also release your personal health information to another health care facility or professional who is not affiliated with our organization but who is or will be providing treatment to you. For example, if you are going to receive home health care after you leave the hospital, we may release your personal health information to that home health care agency so that a plan of care can be prepared for you. In emergencies, we will use and disclose your personal health information to provide the treatment you require.

**Payment**

We will make uses and disclosures of your personal health information as necessary for the payment purposes of those health professionals and facilities that have treated you or provided services to you. For example, we may forward information regarding your medical procedures and treatment to your insurance company to arrange payment for the services provided to you or we may use your information to prepare a bill to send to you or to the person responsible for your payment.  We may also inform your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or determine if your health plan will cover the treatment.

**Health Care Operations**

We will use and disclose your personal health information as necessary, and as permitted by law, to support the daily activities related to health care operations. **** These activities may include, but are not limited to, clinical quality improvement, professional peer review, business management, training medical students, accreditation and licensing, etc. For example, we may use and disclose your personal health information to medical staff, clinicians or other hospital associates for review and learning to support improving the clinical treatment and care of our patients. We may also disclose your personal health information to another health care facility, health care professional, or health plan for such things as quality assurance and case management, but only if that facility, professional, or plan also has or had a patient relationship with you. 

We may also contact you to provide appointment reminders, follow up on services provided or to provide test results. We may call you by name in the waiting room when your physician is ready to see you. 

We may use or disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to provide you with information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits or services that might interest you. For example, your name and address may be used to send you information about services offered by BVHS. 

**Business Associates**

Certain aspects and components of our services are performed through contracts with outside persons or organizations, such as auditing, legal services, technical support, etc. It may be necessary for us to provide personal health information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to appropriately safeguard the privacy and security of your information. 

**Research**

In limited circumstances, we may use and disclose your personal health information for research purposes. For example, a research organization may wish to compare outcomes of all patients that received a particular drug and will need to review a series of medical records. In all cases where your specific authorization has not been obtained, your privacy will be protected by strict confidentiality requirements applied by an Institutional Review Board or privacy board which oversees the research or by representations of the researchers that limit their use and disclosure of patient information.

**RIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE**

**Inspect and Copy Protected Health Information**

A designated record set contains medical and billing records and any other records that BVHS uses for making decisions about you. You have the right to obtain an electronic copy of your health information that exists in an electronic format and you may direct that the copy be transmitted directly to an entity or person designated by you, provided that any such designation is clear, conspicuous, and specific with complete name and mailing address or other identifying information. All requests must be made in writing and signed by you or your representative. BVHS may charge you a fee for our labor and supplies in preparing your copy of medical records. This fee is established by Ohio law.

This right does not include inspection and copying of the following records: psychotherapy notes; information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or use in, a civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding; and protected health information that is subject to law that prohibits access to protected health information. 

**Amendments to Your Personal Health Information**

You have the right to request in writing that personal health information that we maintain about you be amended or corrected. We are not obligated to make all requested amendments but will give each request careful consideration. All amendment requests, in order to be considered by us, must be in writing, signed by you or your representative, and must state the reasons for the amendment/correction request. If an amendment or correction you request is made by us, we may also notify others who work with us and have copies of the uncorrected record if we believe that such notification is necessary. 

**Accounting of Disclosures of Your Personal Health Information**

You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures made by us of your personal health information for six years prior to the date of your request. Requests must be made in writing and signed by you or your representative.
