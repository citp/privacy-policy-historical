                    <hr>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Percolate Industries, Inc. ("Percolate")'s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Percolate receives your information through our various web sites, APIs, services and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by Percolate in the United States or any other country where Percolate operates.</p>

                    <h3>Information Collection and Use (Notice and Data Integrity)</h3>

                    <p>Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a Percolate account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address, and authentication to 3rd party platforms like Twitter and Google Reader. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, will appear publicly on our Services when you share content on another site, such as Facebook or Twitter, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration (during the alpha phase they do).</p>

                    <p>Additional Information: You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find Percolate users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>

                    <p>Posts, Following, Sources and other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the posts you create and the metadata provided with these posts, such as when you posted, the people you follow, the sources you have in our system, and many other bits of information. When you share information on a third party site, the privacy settings you set through that site will remain unless you change them.  The fact that you shared information on a third party site will be publicly viewable on Percolate.  Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want.  Keep in mind that if your privacy settings on a third party site are set to public, then your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, your public posts are searchable by many search engines and are immediately delivered via our APIs to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by Percolate, not just your posts.</p>

                    <p>Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.</p>

                    <p>Links: Percolate may keep track of how you interact with links in posts across our Services including third party sites by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

                    <p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Percolate may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

                    <p>Third Party Services: Percolate uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>

                    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure (Onward Transfer)</h3>

                    <p>Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your Percolate account.</p>

                    <p>Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p>

                    <p>Law and Harm: We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Percolate's rights or property.</p>

                    <p>Business Transfers: In the event that Percolate is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>

                    <p>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public posts or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>

                    <h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>

                    <p>Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@percolate.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>

                    <h3>Modifying Your Personal Information (Access)</h3>

                    <p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>

                    <p>California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address:  Percolate Industries, Inc. 107 Grand Street, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10013.</p>

                    <h3>Opt-Out Policy (Choice)</h3>

                    <p>We do not sell, trade or otherwise disclose our users' information to any third parties. If at any time after registering for the site, signing up for any of our marketing emails or otherwise choosing to receive information from us, you change your mind then please send us a request specifying your new choice. To opt out of marketing or promotional emails, please either click unsubscribe in the body of the email communication or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@percolate.com">privacy@percolate.com</a>.</p>

                    <p>You may also write to us at: Percolate Industries, Inc. 107 Grand Street, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10013</p>

                    <p>If you prefer to call, our number is (646) 470-8346</p>

                    <h3>Security</h3>

                    <p>We have implemented security measures to protect user information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Each of our employees is aware of our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.</p>

                    <h3>EU Data Privacy Statement</h3>

                    <p>We process user information in our facilities in the United States.  All user information subject to this Privacy Policy is collected in the United States, obtained through websites in the United States, or obtained in other countries and transferred to the United States. Regardless where it originated, all user information subject to this Privacy Policy receives the same level of privacy protection as described herein.</p>

                    <p>We handle personal information that is subject to EU data protection laws in accordance with the seven principles outlined in EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data (the “Safe Harbor Principles”). Additional information about the Safe Harbor program is available at the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>EU Personal Data Protection After Safe Harbor Invalidation.</strong>&nbsp;In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Safe Harbor program as the basis for the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area. In order to continue providing services to our global client base, we are working to develop ways for our clients to continue transferring personal data to us in compliance with EU data protection laws.  When necessary, we implement EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (pre-approved by the European Commission and also referred to as the Model Clauses), through our Data Processing Addendum.  Furthermore, on February 2, 2016, the US and the European Union announced their agreement to a new framework for personal data transfer, referred to as the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield framework has not yet been implemented, but we will continue to monitor developments related to the Privacy Shield and work with clients to ensure that their transfer of personal data is compliant with EU data protection laws.</p>

                    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

                    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at http://percolate.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h3>Questions or Feedback</h3>

                    <p>Thoughts or questions about this Privacy Policy? Please, let us know at <a href="mailto:privacy@percolate.com">privacy@percolate.com</a></p>

                    <p><em>This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 26, 2011. Updated on March 28, 2016.</em></p>
