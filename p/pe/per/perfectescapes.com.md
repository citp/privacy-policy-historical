OVERVIEW

Your privacy is very important to us. We know that privacy is an important issue for our Users, and we take very seriously the protection of our Users’ personal information.

Perfect Escapes is the name under which Intagio Corporation operates this PerfectEscapes.com hotel reservation and travel website (the “Site”). Within this Privacy Policy, "Perfect Escapes" and "we" refer to Intagio Corporation, a Delaware corporation maintaining its principal place of business in San Francisco, California, United States. 

This Privacy Policy describes the information Perfect Escapes collects about its Users and what may happen to that information. Although this Privacy Policy may seem long, Perfect Escapes has prepared a detailed policy because we believe Users should know as much as possible about our practices, so they can make informed decisions.

By using this Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. Perfect Escapes may amend this Privacy Policy at any time and will notify Users of any such amendment by posting the amended Privacy Policy on the Site. Any such amendment will take effect thirty (30) days after the date on which the amendment is so posted. A User’s continued use of Perfect Escapes’ services, or of this Site, following such posting will mean that the User has accepted those amendments.

By accepting the Perfect Escapes User Agreement, you consent to our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Perfect Escapes [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20070506150425id_/http%3A//www.perfectescapes.com/Agreement.aspx) and [ Legal Notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20070506150425id_/http%3A//www.perfectescapes.com/Legal.aspx). Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our User Agreement, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the State of California

INFORMATION THAT PERFECT ESCAPES COLLECTS.

Our primary goal in collecting personal information from Users is to provide them with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using this Site. This allows Perfect Escapes to provide services and features that are aimed at meeting User needs, and to customize our Site to make their experience easier and quicker. To fully use our services, a User will need to register by providing his or her e-mail address and postal Zip Code. 

  1. Tracking Technology:  
Perfect Escapes logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every connection to the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may track your movement within the Site, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. We only use this information in aggregate and do not link it to you personally unless you opt in through registration. To gauge the effectiveness of our Site, we do collect some generic information about our Users. Our web servers automatically recognize a User's domain name, the web page from which a User enters our Site, which pages a User visits on our Site, and how much time a User spends on each page. We may use anonymous tracking technologies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes and to improve the products and services we provide. We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our Site. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources for instance to verify your address or update your information and to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Site for you. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Site. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are used to differentiate subscribers from non-subscribers, to customize the content of certain sections of the website, and enable us to track and target the interests of our Users to enhance the experience on our Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 


  2. E-Mail Registration:  
To receive our free e-mail updates, and to receive other offers from time to time, you must first register by providing your e-mail address and postal Zip Code. Information you provide may be used to contact you about the services on our Site. 


  3. Surveys or Promotions:  
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes or other promotions on our Site, which might be sponsored or conducted by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review that party's privacy policy. 


  4. Tell-A-Friend:  
We may from time to time conduct a referral service to introduce people you know to our Site and services. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Perfect Escapes stores this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at privacy@perfectescapes.com to request that we remove this information from our database. 


  5. Surveys:  
We may from time to time provide a survey for our Users to fill out providing us with demographic information (such as income level and gender). We encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our Site but participation is entirely voluntary. 


  6. Third Party Links:  
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web Site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by our Site 



USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

As a general practice, Perfect Escapes does not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about its Users to any third parties. The following describes some of the ways that a User’s personally identifiable information may be disclosed: 

  1. Vendors:  
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 


  2. E-Mail Newsletters:  
If you wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. 


  3. Service-related Announcements:  
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a service or product is delayed we might send you an email, or if there is some service issue with something you might have ordered. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 


  4. Third Party Offers:  
We do _not_ share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties for the purpose of allowing Third Parties to send offers or promotions to you. Perfect Escapes may itself occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions that we have found to be of interest to our Users. If you do not want Perfect Escapes to use the information you provide in order to inform you of products and services that might be of interest, you can make your preference known at [ privacy@perfectescapes.com](mailto:privacy@perfectescapes.com). 


  5. Exceptional Circumstances:  
If Intagio Corporation or its parent company are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the customer database of Perfect Escapes could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction. In such transactions, personal information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained. In the event Intagio Corporation goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. 


  6. Compliance with Legal Orders:  
We also may have to release personally identifying information when it is necessary to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Perfect Escapes or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 



CHOICE AND OPT OUT

You may opt-out of use of your information as set forth above by emailing us at [privacy@perfectescapes.com](mailto:privacy@perfectescapes.com). If you do not wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. You may also email us at [privacy@perfectescapes.com](mailto:privacy@perfectescapes.com). 

ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION

We will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate.
