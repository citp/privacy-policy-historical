If you elect to participate in a survey, we require that you provide complete and accurate information about yourself and your household.<br><br>Computer hardware, software, and other configuration information: Our application may collect certain basic hardware, software, computer configuration and application usage information about the computer on which you install our application, including such data as the speed of the computer processor, its memory capacities and Internet connection speed.  In addition, our application may report on devices connected to your computer, such as the type of printer or router you may be using.<br><br>Internet usage information: Once you install our application, it monitors all of the Internet behavior that occurs on the computer on which you install the application, including both your normal web browsing and the activity that you undertake during secure sessions, such as filling a shopping basket, completing an application form or checking your online accounts, which may include personal financial or health information. We may use the information that we monitor, such as name and address, for the purpose of better understanding your household demographics; however we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers. Inadvertently, we may collect such information about our panelists; and when this happens, we make commercially viable efforts to purge our database of such information.<br><br>This application also tracks the pace and style with which you enter information online (for example, whether you click on links, type in webpage names, or use shortcut keys), the usage of cookies, and statistics about your use of online applications (for example, it may observe that during a given period of use of a computer, the computer downloaded X number of bytes of data using a particular Internet enabled gaming application).<br><br>Please note: Our application does not examine the text of your instant messages or e-mail messages. We may, however, review select e-mail header information from web-based e-mails as a way to verify your contact information and your online usage information.<br><br></div><div><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><br><br></div><a name="Section3"></a><div class="C_H1">How is the information collected?</div><div class="C_TD">This application monitors your Internet usage by transmitting to our servers information about the web pages that you visit and the actions that you take while online. In addition, we may ask for information about you using surveys, for which participation is completely voluntary. We may also combine the information that you provide us with additional information (such as select credit bureau and prescription information) or with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies, credit reporting agencies, and prescription benefits managers) using confidential matching procedures. In these cases, we will: (i) provide the third party data match processor only the personal information necessary to perform a match and, infrequently, to assist us performing statistical analyses; (ii) establish procedures and legal obligations that prohibit use of the information received for any other purpose or disclosure of this information to anyone else; and (iii) require destruction of the received information after completion of the match. The information that we obtain from other sources will not include confidential personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and account numbers. Your information is stored in the United States where our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of other countries may differ from those of the United States.  Your information may be processed outside of the United States, provided that the data protection laws of such processing location affords similar if not more protections than those afforded in the United States for the processed data.<br><br></div><div><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><br><br></div><a name="Section4"></a><div class="C_H1">How is the collected information used?</div><div class="C_TD">Market Research Reports: Applying concepts similar to those used by television-rating services, we use the information collected through our application and your survey responses, combined with information from other sources, to make statistically-based projections about current and future Internet user behavior and, more generally, to extrapolate data about potential economic trends.  For certain commercial customers, we may provide individual-level information. We make this data available so that these customers may enhance their own understanding of Internet usage and online commercial trends.  In all cases, we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers from the data being provided.<br><br>Our customers use our market research reports to: (i) modify online services and offerings; (ii) make more effective use of online data to understand both online and offline commercial behavior; and (iii) discern general economic trends and the business performance of specific entities for a wide range of business purposes including, but not limited to, identifying financial investment opportunities and understanding the value and interest in certain business enterprises.<br><br>By Service Providers: From time to time, we may share your contact information with those third parties who help us deliver this program to you (for example, companies that administer incentive programs). When we do this, we provide only the necessary information for the service provider to perform its assigned function, and we contractually prohibit the use or disclosure of this information to anyone else unless you authorize it.<br><br>As Required by Law: In rare cases, and as is done by any other business, if we are compelled to disclose certain information through a valid legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, or a search warrant, we would do so. However, we would comply by providing only the minimum information necessary.<br><br></div><div><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><br><br></div><a name="Section5"></a><div class="C_H1">How is the information secured?</div><div class="C_TD">Safeguards: We have implemented a variety of safeguards (including physical, digital, and legal protections) focused on ensuring that the information collected through this program is protected from unauthorized use, modification, or disclosure. For example, any secure information collected by our application is encrypted before it is sent to our servers. Moreover, our employees are subjected to periodic evaluation and investigation, are contractually restricted on their use and access to personally identifiable information, and are educated and retrained as needed on internal security policies and procedures.<br><br>If you would like to access, modify, and/or request deletion of the personally identifiable profile information submitted by you as part of this program, you may complete a support form on our website, or e-mail our support staff at the e-mail address provided below.<br><br></div><div><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><br><br></div><a name="Section6"></a><div class="C_H1">Are cookies used by your website or your application?</div><div class="C_TD">We do not use our cookies to store or acquire data about you; however, we do use cookies to identify you as you go through any required registration processes on our site, and to assist us in conducting occasional diagnostic tests to ensure that our system is functioning correctly.
