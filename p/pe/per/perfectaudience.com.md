  * Order ID

#### How do we use the information we collect?

The data that Perfect Audience collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements to individuals across the different websites they visit. Perfect Audience also uses data to predict advertisement responses and to help determine which ads perform best.

If a user voluntarily provides Perfect Audience with personally identifiable information (“PII”) by way of email or by completing an online form, Perfect Audience will only use that PII to contact the user and respond to that user's inquiry.

For more information on how Perfect Audience uses your information, please see Marin Software’s Privacy Policy for Information Collected From Marin Software Sites, Emails and Communications: <http://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/privacy-policy-website>

  


#### Data Collected from our Services.

Users should also be aware that advertisements provided by Perfect Audience may direct users to websites of third party advertisers, and such third party advertisers are not subject to this privacy policy. Users should carefully review the privacy policies of those websites they visit to assess the security of any PII they disclose.

To better customize the online user experience and provide Perfect Audience customers with useful statistics and analysis regarding their websites and advertisements, Perfect Audience may collect certain anonymous information (i.e., information that is not linked to PII), including, but not limited to, usage information, transaction information, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, mouse position, scroll position and time on page. Perfect Audience may use such information to analyze trends, administer its site and provide its services, customize the advertising and content users may see, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Perfect Audience collects data on behalf of its customers that use its software. Under the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (“GDPR”), Perfect Audience is a data “processor” for its customers. That means that Perfect Audience only processes data upon customer direction and pursuant to customer instructions. If you are an EU subject and have a data subject request, please contact us at [ _privacy@marinsoftware.com_](mailto:privacy@marinsoftware.com) and we will work with you to ensure that any data held by us about you is appropriately updated, or deleted. We process all data at our data centers, which are located in the United States.

  


#### What security measures does Perfect Audience use to protect the information that it collects?

Perfect Audience takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unauthorized alteration, disclosure and/or destruction of data. This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use. This also includes, but is not limited to, using encryption. Any data stored on Perfect Audience servers is treated as confidential and is not available to the public. Perfect Audience has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

  


#### What about children's privacy?

Perfect Audience is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy. Perfect Audience and its site and service are not developed for or directed at children. If you believe a child has provided Perfect Audience with PII and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us at: [_privacy@marinsoftware.com_](mailto:privacy@marinsoftware.com) or [_tech@perfectaudience.com_](mailto:tech@perfectaudience.com).

  


#### Does Perfect Audience share the information that it collects with anyone?

Perfect Audience may share anonymized, aggregated information collected with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

Perfect Audience does not rent or sell PII to anyone, and would only share PII with a third-party upon receipt of a user’s express request and consent.

Perfect Audience may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate provision of Perfect Audience’s services, to provide services on our behalf, to perform service-related support (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and service feature improvement) or to help us analyze how customers use Perfect Audience’s services. These third parties may have access to your data but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Perfect Audience may release data when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of Perfect Audience, our employees, users, or others.

If you would like to opt-out from having Perfect Audience partners collect your data, please [click here](http://ib.adnxs.com/optout). When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. This opt-out cookie tells Perfect Audience not to collect your Non-PII to help us tailor customer advertisement campaigns. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Most websites employ "cookies," which may include an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to a user's browser from a website and stored on the user's hard drive. The website placing the cookie on the user's computer can then recognize the computer when the user navigates the website at a later time. For more information, please visit Marin Software’s Cookie Disclosure: [ http://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/cookie-saas](http://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/cookie-saas)

  


#### Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy

Through cookies placed on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you are no longer using Perfect Audience’s services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the services Perfect Audience provides and customize your online experience.

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. Perfect Audience does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the our services and thereafter. Please note that this is Perfect Audience’s Do Not Track policy, and we cannot – and do not – make any promises about how third parties react when you set a “do not track” signal on your browser.
