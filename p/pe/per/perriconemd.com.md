The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. We endeavor to safeguard and protect our end-users’ personal information. When end-users make personal information available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any personal information offline). When our registration process asks end-users to submit sensitive information (such as credit/debit card information), and when we transmit such sensitive information, that sensitive information is encrypted and is protected with transport layer security (“TLS”) encryption software and is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, PCI-DSS 3.1.

Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store personal information in are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.

Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers may circumvent our security measures and gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software constitutes a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your personal information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data done on or through the Site is at your own risk.

Only employees or third party agents who need personal information to perform a specific job function are granted access to our end-users’ personal information. Employees not adhering to our internal privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action.

In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail, where possible, in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. There are various mechanisms to provide you with control over your information, including the following:

  * Tracking Technologies and Advertising: You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, as well as web beacons, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies (including those of third party vendors) when you direct your browser to the Perricone MD® Offerings.

  * Email Communications: To opt out of receiving the Newsletter and/or other e-mail communications from us, you can follow the instructions at the end of the applicable e-mail message, contact us via mail at the address listed in Section 20 “Contact Us,” or call us at (888) 823-7837.

Please note that if you decide to opt out, it may take a few days to process your opt-out request by email and 6–8 weeks to process your postal mail request and that you may continue to receive promotional or marketing materials during this time. Also, please note that opting out will not preclude us from sending you other types of non-promotional messages, such as emails confirming transactions. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

At your request, we will inform you of what personal information we have on file for you. In addition, at your request, and to the greatest extent of our abilities, we will remove personal information that you have provided to us, or that we have collected. You may do so by contacting us via e-mail at: info@perriconemd.com; provided, however, that we ask individuals to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

Please be advised that deleting your personal information will limit our ability to contact you in connection with the Perricone MD® Offerings, which may limit your ability to utilize the Perricone MD® Offerings. If you wish to be contacted by us in connection with the Perricone MD® Offerings, you may not request that the personal information that we have on file for you be deleted.

Please be further advised that, after your personal information is deleted, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
