In order to use full functionality offered by the Sites, a user may be required to provide certain personal information (such as job title and email address) asides from providing information about personal feedback, perceptions, or assessments.  We use this information to score individual or team feedback reports in subjects such as, but not limit to, Communication Skills, Leadership and Management Development, Performance Development, Personality Profiles. Sometimes, it is required for the  user to provide demographic information (such as job level and gender) in some of  our on-line surveys and this practice is necessary so we can provide a more personalized  assessment analysis for the users, or be able to average perceptions or experience  scores for each and all demographic groups. Profiles Information provided by users of the Sites is stored in a user profile in our database.
