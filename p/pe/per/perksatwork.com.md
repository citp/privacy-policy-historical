We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your information. We take reasonable measures to secure your information, including industry standard administrative, physical and technical controls. These controls include encryption, third party audits, access controls and security testing. 

We use cookies to provide you with the best experience while using the Program, to manage your browser sessions and to power the Program's functionality. Cookies allow you to use all of the Program's functions as designed. Disabling cookies will limit functionality of the Program and significantly degrade the user experience. 

Some third parties (e.g., advertisers, tracking utilities) use cookies and Web beacons on their site(s). We do not have access or control over these tracking technologies. We do not share your personal data with these advertisers. 

This Privacy Policy covers Our use of cookies on the Program and the private label subdomains delivered by Us, only. This Privacy Policy notice does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. 

Because We provide the Program worldwide, this may involve Us transferring your information to countries whose data protection laws differ from the laws of the originating country. 

With the exception of pre-registration emails, We do not send you unsolicited emails without your consent. We send pre-registration emails at the request of your organization. You may choose to receive correspondence, including email reminders, newsletters and Program updates using the "My Account" section of the Program. 

All emails sent by Us relating to the Program contain instructions on how to unsubscribe from future correspondence.

Users may also access and edit their personal information in the "My Account" section of the Program.

This Privacy Policy may be reviewed and amended from time to time. You will be notified of changes to this Privacy Policy by a notice posted on the Program login page. The notice will contain a link, whereby the amended privacy policy can be examined in full. In this way you will be made aware of policy changes prior to browsing or shopping on the Program. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check Our website frequently to see recent changes. As always, if you are not amenable to the conditions of a revised privacy policy you may opt out of the Program by the means outlined earlier in the 'Opting Out' section above. 

Many offers on the Program will redirect you to a participating merchant's web site. An interstitial page will be displayed that will inform you that you are being redirected. At this point, you will be on the merchant web site and the merchant's privacy policy will now apply to any information you provide. It is important to read and familiarize yourself with the merchant's privacy policy. 

Although your privacy is of paramount concern to Us, We cannot reasonably be expected to suppress information where the withholding of such information is a violation of law. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information, as required by law and when it is believed that disclosure is necessary to protect Our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
