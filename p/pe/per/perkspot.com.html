				<p><strong>Your Privacy<br>
</strong>We are committed to protecting your privacy. At no time will we trade, sell, or distribute for free organization specific or personal information, including email addresses or other user IDs, to any individual, company, vendor or organization,<br>
in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the site www.perkspot.com and private label sub-domains delivered by 12 Interactive LLC, (i.e. abc.perkspot.com, etc.). Because 12 Interactive LLC wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices.</p>
<p><strong>The Personal Information Collected by PerkSpot</strong><br>
Your first name, last name, valid work email address, and work zip code represent the only pieces of personal information you must submit to access PerkSpot. In certain instances, other demographic data will be collected, but not required. PerkSpot uses this information to provide the benefits/services associated with the program. Additionally, PerkSpot collects click-stream data and other preference information on its users in order to improve the design and vendor selection of the site. Click-stream data represents a page-by-page history of a person’s site usage.</p>
<p>PerkSpot is a portal through which users access discounts redeemable at selected vendors. In most cases, online purchases facilitated by the PerkSpot portal are subject to the privacy policies of the website where that transaction is conducted. In a few cases; however, PerkSpot itself functions as the vendor and must collect additional personal information, described later in this privacy policy, to complete the online transaction.</p>
<p><strong>On the Corporate Sites</strong><br>
First name, last name, employer, number of employees, valid work email address and phone number are the only required pieces of information collected on www.perkspot.com. This is done on a voluntary basis and ensures that 12 Interactive LLC can properly respond to all inquiries submitted through the site.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use This Personal Information</strong><br>
12 Interactive LLC requires your first name, last name, email address, and home and work zip code for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. To provide a point of contact for communicating PerkSpot correspondence, including your personal password, technical issues that may arise and periodic reminders that you may request (on an opt-in basis) as a PerkSpot user.<br>
2. To assign a name to your user id and password.<br>
3. To verify your employment with the organization using PerkSpot.<br>
4. To provide the benefits/services associated with PerkSpot.</p>
<p>Click-stream data can help determine the popularity of vendors, offers and site features with our audience, allowing us to develop a better site. An individual user’s click-stream data is kept in the strictest confidence, and will never be distributed to any party outside of 12 Interactive LLC.</p>
<p><strong>On the Corporate Sites</strong><br>
Information submitted through www.perkspot.com is done so on a voluntary basis by individuals seeking to learn more about 12 Interactive LLC. Personal information is gathered to ensure a prompt and accurate reply by a 12 Interactive LLC representative.</p>
<p><strong>What Information We Share</strong><br>
12 Interactive LLC only shares aggregated data to third party vendors, but it will not disclose information specific to any user or company, including email address. This information represents a generic overview of our users’ collective viewing habits and allows vendors to modify their discounts based on user traffic. Additionally, some participating corporations have requested monthly reports of traffic on PerkSpot. These reports will reveal only the aggregated viewing habits of PerkSpot visitors for your organization. The reports will not disclose the user name, login ID or any other personal information of users, including email address.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. 12 Interactive LLC uses cookies on the site(s). 12 Interactive LLC tracks open rates and click-through rates of email communications using industry-standard technology. 12 Interactive LLC does link the information stored in cookies to personally identifiable information, including email address, you submit while on the site(s).</p>
<p>12 Interactive LLC uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the site(s). A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies are set to store an encrypted link to your account information, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable 12 Interactive LLC to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the site(s). If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>
<p>Some business partners (e.g., advertisers, tracking utilities) use cookies on the site(s). 12 Interactive LLC has no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.perkspot.com and private label subdomains delivered by 12 Interactive LLC only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Emails</strong><br>
12 Interactive LLC will not send unsolicited emails to registered users of PerkSpot without consent. Additionally, users may choose to receive PerkSpot correspondence, including email reminders of specific vendor offers and PerkSpot newsletters. The “my account” channel on the site displays the correspondence you’ve elected to receive, and provides the option to unsubscribe from future PerkSpot related emails.</p>
<p>All emails sent by PerkSpot contain directions on how to unsubscribe from future correspondence. At any time, users may opt out of PerkSpot related correspondence by sending an email to cs@perkspot.com. Users may also access their personal information, including email address to make edits in the “My Account” section of the website.</p>
<p>In addition, a registered user who wishes that their personal information, including email address to be completely removed from the PerkSpot database should email help@perkspot.com. We will respond to your request within thirty [30] business days. An employee’s complete removal of his or her personal information from the database negates that employee’s ability to login to PerkSpot.</p>
<p><strong>Notification Of Changes To Privacy Policy</strong><br>
Users will be notified of changes or revisions to this privacy policy, including our email practices, by a notice posted on the login page of PerkSpot. The notice will contain a link, whereby the privacy policy can be examined in full. In this way registered users are made aware of policy changes prior to shopping or browsing the website. As always, a user who is not amenable to the conditions of a revised privacy policy may opt out of PerkSpot by the means outlined earlier in this document.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing Items Directly Through PerkSpot</strong><br>
<strong>Agents</strong><br>
12 Interactive LLC uses an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
12 Interactive LLC uses other third parties to process credit card transactions on the site(s). When you sign up for programs directly related to PerkSpot, 12 Interactive LLC will share first name, last name, credit card information and billing address as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 12 Interactive LLC will not share email addresses with those third parties for the purpose of processing credit card transactions. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information, including email address, for any other purpose. PerkSpot is a portal that provides access to exclusive discounts redeemable at the point of purchase at a certain vendor’s online or offline location. In rare cases, PerkSpot may serve as both vendor and portal, and will collect certain information necessary to complete an online purchase. Like every online purchase, you will be required to submit the following information to buy an item where PerkSpot is the vendor:<br>
• Shipping or billing address or both<br>
• Credit card information<br>
• Day time phone number<br>
• Email address</p>
<p>In all cases, any transaction conducted through PerkSpot is secured and encrypted. Hence, you may submit any sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) to this site with the assurance that it will remain protected.</p>
<p>Licensees shall provide commercially seasonable measures to protect the security and integrity of any systems. Commercially reasonable efforts shall be made to prevent open proxies, open relays and the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, or Trojans on the licensee’s network and any IP addresses over which Email Messages are sent by Licensee.</p>
<p>Again, PerkSpot will never compromise your personal privacy. Information, including email address, submitted to carry out a transaction where 12 Interactive LLC is the vendor is kept in the highest confidentiality, and is absolutely never shared with outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor’s Privacy</strong><br>
PerkSpot is a portal that enables users to purchase discounted products on the websites of participating vendors. Each vendor maintains its’ own privacy policy that you should be familiar with before you submit your personal information. Our privacy policy is not applicable on any of the vendor sites. Therefore, it is important for a potential buyer to familiarize himself with the privacy policies of each vendor.</p>
<p>12 Interactive LLC will never transmit personal identifiers, including name, email address, or user ids to any participating vendor. Clicking on a vendor site through PerkSpot does not result in the transmission of your personal information to that vendor.</p>
<p><strong>Limits</strong><br>
Although your privacy is of paramount concern to us, 12 Interactive LLC cannot reasonably be expected to suppress information where the withholding of such information represents a violation of federal or state law.</p>
<p>12 Interactive LLC reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information, including email address, as required by law and when it is believed that disclosure is necessary to protect 12 Interactive LLC’s rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the site(s).</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
As a user of PerkSpot, you consent to our collection and storage of your personal information, including email address, (as defined above) in our database, and to our use of aggregated and non-personal information generated by the viewing habits<br>
of our users.</p>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong><br>
12 Interactive LLC is committed to protecting your privacy. 12 Interactive LLC does not sell, trade, give away, or rent personal or company information, including email address, to any outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>12 Interactive LLC uses the information collected on the site to make shopping and promotional activities possible and to enhance your overall experience with PerkSpot.</p>
