<p><em>Perdue
Salisbury Corporate Office</em> </p>
<p><em>Salisbury, Maryland, United States of America</em></p>
<p>Perdue Farms Inc., ("Perdue" or "we") has developed this policy statement
(the "Privacy Policy") to assist end users of the Perdue family of Web sites or
online social media pages ("you" or "user") in understanding the personally
identifiable information gathering and dissemination practices for Perdue's
United States Web sites or Perdue's branded and authorized online social media
pages, such as Perdue's pages found on FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN, YOUTUBE, TWITTER, or
PINTEREST (collectively, the "Site(s)"). &nbsp;Personally identifiable information ("PII")
includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a
name, address, phone number, or email address. Perdue may modify this Privacy
Policy from time to time. &nbsp;If Perdue
makes changes to this Privacy Policy, Perdue will post those changes at this
location and provide notice of any material changes so that you are aware of
what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if
any, we disclose it. &nbsp;Please review this
Privacy Policy on a periodic basis.</p>
<p><strong><span>What Information Does Perdue Collect?</span></strong></p>
<p>The type of PII collected by Perdue will vary with your use of the Site(s).
Perdue gathers most information during the registration processes Perdue utilizes
to allow access to and/or use of certain information. &nbsp;But, Perdue may collect PII at other times,
including, but not limited to, when you report a problem with our Site(s), when
you complete survey forms, when you access the Career area, enter into a transaction
through the Site(s), respond to requests for information or content, and when
you request to receive communications from Perdue. &nbsp;Below, we provide specific examples of the
types of PII Perdue may collect through the Site(s).</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Perdue may request or require contact
information, such as your name, address, phone number, facsimile number, and
email address.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic Information:</strong> Perdue may collect demographic and
profile data at our Site(s) as a part of its surveys, resume collection
features, recipe offerings, advertisements for its products, and/or for
management and monitoring purposes in order to continue to improve the Site(s)
and the quality of Perdue's on-line services.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Information:</strong> &nbsp;Perdue
may collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from all users of our Site(s) as
well as the date and time of access and the Web page(s) accessed. Perdue may
also catalog your log-in information and your computer, browser, or operating
system information and may maintain a database of aggregated information about
the transactions on the Site(s) (<em>e.g</em>.,
tool or feature utilization or recipe selection data).</p>
<p><strong><span>How Does Perdue Use that Information?</span></strong></p>
<p>Most of the Site(s) is informational in nature and publicly available to
all users. Consequently, until you participate in surveys or register for
information from Perdue, you are able to browse the Site(s) without providing
any PII, although your browser may tell us what type of computer and operating
system you are using as well as other kinds of technical information. Below, is
more detail on how Perdue uses your PII.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Perdue may use your name and city and state
address for testimonials or your contact information for many purposes,
including, to advertise its services and the goods and services of third
parties, to create a personalized experience for you, to provide you with news
and information, to contact you regarding a survey, and to get in touch with
you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted through the Site(s),
material changes in our Site(s)'s policies and agreements, new services Perdue
may offer, or otherwise. We may also share your contact information with our
affiliates and business partners, as is necessary to provide our services and
information, to facilitate the collection and use of resumes provided through
the Site(s)'s "CAREER" area, for advertising purposes, and for
internal business purposes. Except for sharing arrangements with Perdue's
affiliates, vendors, and business partners, however, we do not share your
individual contact information with other types of third parties for any other
purpose, except to a court or governmental agency if required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic Information:</strong> Perdue may share demographic data on an
aggregated basis, which will not identify any particular user, with our
business partners, vendors, and affiliates or government regulators and for
advertising purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Results:</strong> Perdue may share survey results collected through
the Site(s) with its business partners, vendors, and affiliates and/or the
general public, the news media, and with the U.S. Government and state
governments, not only for business or marketing purposes or as may be required
by law, but also to participate in government programs and initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Perdue may use technical information to
help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze the Site(s)'s usage trends,
track user movements on the Site(s), and to otherwise manage and monitor our Site(s).</p>
<p><strong>Business Transactions:</strong> In the event that Perdue goes through a
business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition by another company
involving the sale of all or a portion of its assets, please note that the PII
collected and retained by Perdue may be among the assets transferred. In the
event a transaction of this kind occurs that results in the transfer of PII,
Perdue will notify you via email and/or place a prominent notice on the Site(s)
for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control and the possible changes
to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Action:</strong> Perdue may disclose PII when legally required to do
so in accordance with government requests or regulations or legal proceedings.
We may also disclose PII to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site(s)
or as is otherwise required to limit legal liability, protect or defend our
rights, property, or interests, or protect the safety, rights, or property of
our users.</p>
<p><strong><span>What About the Use of Cookies?</span></strong></p>
<p>Perdue may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site(s).
Cookies are pieces of information that Perdue uses for record-keeping purposes,
which the Site(s) transfers to your computer's Web-browser for storage on your
computer's hard drive. Cookies enable Perdue to customize your experience on
the Site(s). Cookies also make Web-surfing easier by automatically performing
certain functions such as saving your personal preferences and by ensuring that
you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly. Many consider the use of
cookies to be an industry standard. Consequently, your Web browser is likely
set to accept cookies. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, however, you
can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse or delete cookies. If you
choose to have your browser refuse or delete cookies, you should understand
that it is possible that some areas of our Site(s) will not function properly
when you view them.</p>
<p><strong><span>What About External or Third Party Web Sites?</span></strong></p>
<p>To the extent hyperlinks or gateways (whether through banner advertisements
or otherwise) are utilized to access external or third party sites or social
media pages, you should be aware that these external or third party sites or
pages may collect PII and are not controlled by Perdue and therefore, are not
subject to this Privacy Policy. Perdue suggests that you check the privacy
policies of these sites or pages to determine how the proprietors of these
third party sites will utilize your PII.</p>
<p><strong><span>What About Security?</span></strong></p>
<p>As is appropriate for the nature of PII collected and stored by Perdue, the
Site(s) has industry standard security measures or safeguards in place to
protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under
Perdue's control. Although Perdue has endeavored to create a secure and
reliable Site(s), however, the confidentiality of any communication or material
cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, you should consider carefully if you want to
submit sensitive information to Perdue. Perdue urges you to take every
precaution to protect your PII when on-line.</p>
<p><strong><span>What About "Opting-Out" of Data Collection and Use?</span></strong></p>
<p>As you are permitted to browse the Site(s) without registering, you can
decide on your own if you wish to provide your PII to Perdue (when requested)
or opt-out of doing so. For example, if Perdue conducts a survey, you do not
have to participate unless you agree to do so. Perdue also provides you with
the opportunity to opt-out of certain Perdue business practices where your PII
may be used. For example, users may opt-out of having Perdue use your PII in
connection with the following activities: (i) inclusion in mailings or (ii)
email communications or newsletters sent by Perdue. </p>
<p><strong><span>What About Correcting, Deleting, or Updating Information?</span></strong></p>
<p>Perdue will retain your PII for as long as necessary to fulfill the
purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. &nbsp;At any time, you may contact Perdue to
correct, modify, or delete the information you provide to Perdue through the
Site(s). Please note, however, that the collection and uses of certain PII is
necessary to provide certain information and services through the Site(s) and
the deletion of such necessary information, <em>e.g.</em>,
an email address, may render a particular service or Perdue's ability to
provide it inoperable.</p>
<p><strong><span>What About Children?</span></strong></p>
<p>Perdue cares about the safety of children on its Site(s) and encourages
parents and guardians to monitor their children's use of the Internet. Although
the Site(s) is suitable for a general audience, the Site(s) is intended for use
only by users who are over 18 years of age or the legal age of majority.
Accordingly, Perdue does not knowingly solicit PII from children or send them
requests for personal information.</p>
<p><strong><span>What About Any Other Questions?</span></strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the information
collection and dissemination practices of the Site(s), or Perdue's use of your
PII, you can contact Perdue and its employee(s) responsible for its Privacy
Policy and related privacy compliance matters by email at <a href="mailto:consumerinfopf@cybercrs.net">consumerinfopf@cybercrs.net</a>, by phone at 1-800-4PERDUE
