###  **2\. Information we collect and how we collect it**

Personal information (or “personal data”) is any information that can identify you, whether directly or indirectly.  We process different types of personal information (for example, your name, company name, email address, home and/or work address, and/or telephone number). 

Most personal information that we process is collected from you **directly** such as:

  * your name and contact information when you subscribe to our mailing lists and company newsletter;
  * information you provide when interacting with our Public Depot, KnowledgeBase, user lists, and weblog or when reporting a problem with the Website

  * information submitted in any testimonial, comment, or other feedback message on a blog or other public-forum hosted on the Website; and

While you are under no obligation to provide such information, we cannot guarantee that we can provide you with our services if you do not provide certain information.  For example, we may be unable to provide customer support in the event that relevant information related to the use of our products or services is withheld. 

We may collect personal information about you **indirectly** , for example through third party public sources such as LinkedIn or the website of your company or the company that you work for.  Also note that personal information that you provide on our Website may be combined with information collected off-line or from third parties. 

We collect data that cannot be used to specifically identify you individually, but that builds up a picture of who is visiting our site.  Examples of this include details of your visits to our Website, such as traffic data, location data, IP address, resources that you access, and other communication data.

We may remove personal information from certain communications with you relating to customer support, and/or information drawn from such communications, for statistical and/or reference and training purposes.

###  **3\. Why we process your personal information**

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it.  These purposes include:

  * Fulfilling orders and requests for products, services, or information;
  * Entering into our End User Agreement with you (whether with you individually or on behalf of the company that you work for) and performing our obligations under it;
  * Identifying you on our Website in order to customize your experience;
  * Ensuring content from our Website is presented in the most effective manner;
  * Providing you with promotional materials and advertising our products and services;

If we need to use your personal information for any other purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.

###  **4\. Sharing your personal information with third parties**

We do not sell, rent, or lease our customer lists to third parties.  We occasionally hire other third parties to provide services on our behalf, such as partners and distributors of our products.  We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information processed by them and they are prohibited from using it for any purpose other than to deliver the services.  

Some of our products and services are co-branded and offered in conjunction with products developed by other third party companies.  This may occur, for example, where software that we develop is sold by a third party in a package with their own software that complements ours.  We may share with those third parties such personal information collected in conjunction with the co-branded products and services.

In addition, we may share your personal information with:

  * Our parent company, Perforce Intermediate Holdings, LLC, and the affiliates and subsidiaries it controls, in order to support our provision of services to you.
  * Companies that Perforce plans to merge with or be acquired by, or, in the event of any bankruptcy, a bankruptcy estate.  Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity, or the acquiring entity, follow this Policy with respect to your personal information.  If your personal information is intended to be used contrary to this Policy, you will receive prior notice and the opportunity to communicate preferences you may have, if applicable.
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties (i) if Perforce is compelled to do so by law, such as under a subpoena or court order, (ii) when it is necessary to do so to comply with applicable laws, (iii) where the disclosure of personal information is reasonably necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, (iv) to report suspected illegal activity, (v) to investigate violations of the Perforce End User License Agreement, or (vi) as otherwise required by law.
