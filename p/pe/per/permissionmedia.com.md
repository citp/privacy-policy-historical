Third Party Information/List Referrals

EmailUniverse has partnered with PostMaster Direct to provide our list owners another venue for revenue generation with their lists.

Under our standard management agreement, we provide you with forms and list infrastructure via our site, and you just direct visitors to the forms. When new subscribers sign up via your form, the names are added to your lists. Your lists become available for rental via our site. We provide marketing, mailing, merge/purge, and subscribe/unsubscribe services.

**End users:** Your name, email address, zipcode and any other identifying information that you give us will not be revealed to any of the direct marketers who rent our lists. When you sign up for the PostMasterDirect.com mailing lists, you will receive commercial email messages only about those topical categories that you have selected. Before any mailing goes out, their staff personally screens each marketer's message to make sure that it's relevant to the list's topic.

Every PostMasterDirect.com message sent out is coded with a special header and footer that allows you to remove your name from all lists automatically by forwarding the message to [deleteall@postmasterdirect.com](mailto:deleteall@postmasterdirect.com).
