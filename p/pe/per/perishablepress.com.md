## Your privacy choices and rights

We collect data from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. Any data that we request that is not required will be specified as voluntary or optional. Here is an overview of your privacy choices and rights.

### You can choose not to provide us with personal data

If you choose to do this, you can continue to use the website and browse its pages, but we will not be able to process transactions without personal data.

### You can turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings

You can block cookies by activating a setting on your browser allowing you to refuse cookies. You can also delete cookies through your browser settings. If you turn off cookies, you can continue to use the website and browse its pages, but certain site features (like logging into the Members Area) will not work properly.

### You can ask us not to use your data for marketing

We will inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for marketing and if third parties are involved. You can opt out from marketing by contacting us (see the "Contact Us" section below).

### How to exercise your rights

You can exercise your rights by contacting us via our contact page (see the "Contact Us" section below).

### You have the right to access information we hold about you

This includes the right to request supplementary information about:

  * The types of data we’re processing
  * The purposes of any relevant data processing
  * How long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period)



If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.

For any such request, we will provide you with the information within 30 days, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others (e.g. another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights). We’ll tell you if we can’t meet your request for that reason.

### You have the right to make us correct any inaccurate personal data about you

At any time and for any reason, you may contact us to correct any inaccurate personal information that we may have about you.

### You can object to us using your data for profiling or making automated decisions

We may use your data to determine whether we should let you know information that might be relevant to you (for example, tailoring emails to you based on your behavior). Otherwise, the only circumstances in which we will do this is to provide the Perishable Press service to you.

### You have the right to port your data to another service

We will give you a copy of your data so that you can provide it to another service. We will not do so to the extent that this involves disclosing data about any other individual.

### You have the right to be “forgotten” by us

You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## How do we protect your information?

We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the data we collect. Every effort is made to ensure that Perishable Press data is safe and secure. Our business literally depends on solid security, so it is taken _very_ seriously.

### We do not share your information

Other than the third-party vendors listed below, or in situations where we have obtained your consent, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any personally identifiable information to outside parties. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. Note that you can find the privacy policy for each of our trusted third-party vendors below, in the section “Third parties who process your data”.

### Steps we take to help secure your data

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you submit a request, place an order, or access your personal information. These security measures include, but are not limited to:

  * Password protected directories and databases
  * SSL technology for encrypted data transmission
  * Proprietary security measures that actively protect our servers from threats and malicious activity



We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted to our third-party payment processors via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway provider's database, only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your billing information (credit card numbers, etc.) will NOT be stored on our servers.

### And please remember:

  * You are responsible of your username and password: keep them secret and safe
  * If you believe your privacy has been breached, please contact us immediately
  * You provide personal data at your own risk: unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure



## Where do we store your data?

The data we collect is stored on secure servers in California, US, and may be processed in our office in Washington State, US. Also, data may be collected and stored in any data processing facilities operated by the third parties identified below. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing by us.

## How long do we store your data?

We will archive and stop actively using any personal identifiable information about you within 6 months from the last time you used Perishable Press. We will delete your personal data from our archives no later than 6 years from the last time you used Perishable Press or as agreed with you in a separate contract.
