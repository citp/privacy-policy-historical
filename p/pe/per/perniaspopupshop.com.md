The website uses cookies that are a harmless piece of data used to measure anonymous traffic on the website for the continuous improvement of the user experience. For instance, the website will load faster when you visit the website again. By using our website, you accept the use of cookies.

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other devices when you visit a website. This information is then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device.

There are two types of cookies that can be used:

**Persistent cookies**  \- these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
