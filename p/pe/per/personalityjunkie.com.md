# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Personality Junkie®. In using this site, you are accepting the practices described in this policy. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted and will only apply to activities on a going forward, not retroactive basis.

**Email Newsletters**

To help protect privacy and guard against unwarranted use, we use a double opt-in subscription method. Once you have confirmed your subscription in your email, you can expect to receive periodic emails from Personality Junkie. We include an unsubscribe link in the footer of each of our emails, allowing you to unsubscribe at any time.

We will not sell or distribute your email address to any third-parties. Your email is securely stored on our servers and accessed only by authorized users in our organization. We may collect data on open rates, clicks, and subscription date for all subscribers.

**Cookies**

Our website may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and tracking technology are useful for gathering information, such as how visitors use our site. Cookies can also help us customize our site for visitors.

Like millions of other websites, we use Google Analytics to collect data. This data allows us to better understand the kind of people who are using our site and the content they’re reading. It helps us make better decisions about design and content. All of our activity falls within the bounds of the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html).

In response to the **GDPR** , we have opted to no longer collect data on site visits from the 28 countries in the European Union. Namely, we have applied a site-wide filter in Google Analytics that prevents data collection from these countries.

**Distribution of Information**

We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place. The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.  
**  
Commitment to Data Security**

Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information. All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings.
