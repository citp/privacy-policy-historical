<br><br>
As an Information Service, the purpose of PERSONAFILE.com is to use technology to enable businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized ways, without forfeiting the privacy of the user. Therefore privacy is at the core of PERSONAFILE™. 
<br><br>
We do not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any identifiable personal information regarding our members to any third party, with the exception of third-party contractors and service providers who work with PERSONAFILE to provide the personal venues and other services, and who are strictly prohibited from later use of the information that they may have access to. We will disclose personal information to local, state, or federal law enforcement officials when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy provides both members of the PERSONAFILE service and visitors to the PERSONAFILE.com website with information about what information we collect, to what uses that information is put, and to whom that information may be given. If you become a member of PERSONAFILE™, the membership agreement encompasses the provisions that are explained by this document. If you are only a visitor to our website, this Privacy Policy is our promise to you about how information about your visit will be handled. 
<br><br>
This document is a "work in progress," insofar as certain portions may be updated from time to time as the programs and services we offer to our members change. However the principles upon which this document is based will not change, nor will our fundamental commitment to protecting the privacy of our members. We also welcome your continuing input into this policy. Please give us your feedback at <a class="policy" href="mailto:privacy@PERSONAFILE.com">privacy@PERSONAFILE.com</a>. 
<br><br>
PERSONAFILE™'s Privacy Policy and our information practices are based upon the eight principles of Fair Information Practices first issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 1980. These guidelines continue to be the touchstone of all modern privacy laws and regulations, and the concepts set forth in them remain at the heart of privacy protection principles that guide all responsible businesses today. More information about the OECD's "Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data" may be found at: <a class="policy" href="http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,2340,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html" target="_blank">http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,2340,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html</a>. 
<br><br>
<u> <b>Collection Limitation Principle</b></u> 
<br><br>
<b><i>PERSONAFILE.com adheres to the principle that the collection of personal information should be limited to that obtained through fair and lawful means and only with the knowledge and consent of the data subject.</i></b> 
<br><br>
<b>How we deliver:</b> PERSONAFILE makes very clear our policies regarding our data gathering processes and seeks consent before obtaining personally identifiable data from the individual. 
<br><br>
<b>Information We Collect from Visitors</b> 
<br><br>
For visitors to our website, we gather only aggregate, non-personally identifying data about your visit to our website. If you visit PERSONAFILE's website (whether you are using PERSONAFILE's personal venue software or not), PERSONAFILE's web servers log a number of basic pieces of information, including the following: 

<ul type="square">
	<li>The URL (address) of the page(s) requested; </li>
	<li>The time and date of the request(s) and the duration of your visit; </li>
	<li>The "User Agent" (the make and model of the web browser being used, including the name and version of the operating system upon which that web browser is running); </li>
	<li>The "Referrer" (the address of the site whose link you followed to get to our website); </li>
	<li>The IP address and domain name of the computer to which we are sending pages for display by your web browser. </li>
</ul>
<br>
For information about why we gather and how we use this information, see the Purpose Specification and Use Limitation sections of this Privacy Policy. 
<br><br>
<b>Information We Collect from Members</b> 
<br><br>
In our online registration form for new members of the service, we require you to provide us with your full name, full mailing address, email address and a password. In addition, we require your gender, birth date, and a password question with its corresponding answer, so that we may identify you if you ever lose your password. 
<br><br>
Certain information such as your name, address, email address, and birth date constitute "Personal Data" because that information can be used to directly or indirectly identify you. This information is collected and used according to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In the future, we may offer additional services that will have their own usage agreements and/or privacy policies. At the time those services are offered, you will be given an opportunity to review and accept those documents. 
<br><br>
For information about why we gather and how we use this information, see the Purpose Specification and Use Limitation sections of this Privacy Policy. 
<br><br>
<b>Other Data We May Request from Members </b> 
<br><br>
We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by PERSONAFILE.com and/or when you report a problem with any of our services. Any data collected at those times will be used in accordance with this policy, unless otherwise explicitly stated at the time of collection. Many of those sweepstakes, contests, or promotions will have terms of service agreements associated with them and those agreements may differ from provisions of this policy. Therefore, it is important that you read and understand those agreements as the nature of those offerings may require different data privacy provisions that may supercede this Privacy Policy. 
<br><br>

Cookies received in this way are monitored by our ad-serving company, and we do not have access to this information. However, we have contractual arrangements that restrict our partners, including the ad-serving company, from using these cookies for anything other than fulfilling their service to PERSONAFILE.com.

<br><br>
You are always free to decline our cookies, if your browser permits, or to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion.

<b>A Special Note About Children </b> 
<br><br>
PERSONAFILE.com wants to help parents protect the privacy of children and takes steps to obtain parental permission before children may join PERSONAFILE.

<b><i>PERSONAFILE.com adheres to the principle that the purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified at or prior to the time of collection, and that any subsequent use should be limited to the fulfillment of purposes not inconsistent with those purposes previously specified. </i></b> 
<br><br>
<b>How we deliver:</b> We clearly specify the purposes for which we collect personal information from our members and restrict our usage of that data to purposes reasonably related to those described. Prior to any new data usage that may be beyond the scope of previously disclosed purposes, we will disclose such new uses and obtain the data subject's permission. 
<br><br>
<b>Visitors to Our website </b> 
<br><br>
We use information gathered from visitors to our website in an aggregate form to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and to help us better design and organize our website. Although an IP address doesn't necessarily identify a visitor personally, it can sometimes suggest a connection to a particular individual or their computer, therefore we do not disclose the information contained in those logs to third parties unless compelled to by law. Information contained in our web server logs may be used in the course of fraud investigations. 
<br><br>
<b>Members of Our Service </b>
