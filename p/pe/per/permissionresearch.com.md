An elite research community

Our online market research community has millions of participants who are interested in voicing their opinions through surveys and allowing their passively-tracked online browsing and purchasing behavior (including the content of web pages visited) to be used as part of anonymous market research reports that help shape the future of the Internet. The information that you contribute is used by comScore, Inc., a U.S.-based market research company that is a nationally-recognized authority on Internet and general economic trends, whose data are routinely cited by major media outlets such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and CNBC, and is extensively used by the largest Internet services companies and scores of Fortune 500 companies.

Be assured that protection of your privacy is one of our top priorities. While participation in our program will allow us to send you periodic surveys and track information about your online activities such as where you surf and the transactions that you make, the personally identifiable information you provide to us will NOT be used by us, or anyone with whom we do business, to advertise or market products or services to you!

PRIVACY POLICY & USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Before joining our program, enjoying the benefits of this program, and installing our application, you must review and agree to the terms and conditions below and provide and obtain consent to this agreement from anyone who will be using the computers on which you install this application. By installing our application, you agree to be bound by this privacy policy & user license agreement, including the storage of the market research information provided by you on our computer systems in the United States.

Requirements for participation

In order to participate in this program, you must:

  * Be at least 18 years of age and capable of entering into a binding agreement;
  * Be the parent or legal guardian of anyone under 18 having access to such computer;
  * Own or control the computers that you allow to be configured to use this system; and 
  * Not be employed or related to an individual employed by an unaffiliated market research company.



Please note: many companies restrict the installation of software onto work computers. Before you install this software onto a work computer, please check your company’s software installation policy. 

What information is collected?

Basic Demographic Information: When you sign up for this program, we may obtain your contact information and some basic demographic information about you using a questionnaire, information from companies through which you obtained or inquired about this program, or the application that you install onto your computer and allow to track your Internet usage.

Survey response information: Once you agree to participate in this program, we may notify you of survey opportunities through e-mail, pop-ups, toast windows, U.S. mail, and other means. If you elect to participate in a survey, we require that you provide complete and accurate information about yourself and your household.

Computer hardware, software, and other configuration information: Our application may collect certain basic hardware, software, computer configuration and application usage information about the computer on which you install our application, including such data as the speed of the computer processor, its memory capacities and Internet connection speed. In addition, our application may report on devices connected to your computer, such as the type of printer or router you may be using.

Internet usage information: Once you install our application, it monitors all of the Internet behavior that occurs on the computer on which you install the application, including both your normal web browsing and the activity that you undertake during secure sessions, such as filling a shopping basket, completing an application form or checking your online accounts, which may include personal financial or health information. We may use the information that we monitor, such as name and address, for the purpose of better understanding your household demographics; however we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers. Inadvertently, we may collect such information about our panelists; and when this happens, we make commercially viable efforts to purge our database of such information.

This application also tracks the pace and style with which you enter information online (for example, whether you click on links, type in webpage names, or use shortcut keys), the usage of cookies, and statistics about your use of online applications (for example, it may observe that during a given period of use of a computer, the computer downloaded X number of bytes of data using a particular Internet enabled gaming application).

Please note: Our application does not examine the text of your instant messages or e-mail messages. We may, however, review select e-mail header information from web-based e-mails as a way to verify your contact information and your online usage information.

How is the information collected?

This application monitors your Internet usage by transmitting to our servers information about the web pages that you visit and the actions that you take while online. In addition, we may ask for information about you using surveys, for which participation is completely voluntary. We may also combine the information that you provide us with additional information (such as select credit bureau and prescription information) or with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies, credit reporting agencies, and prescription benefits managers) using confidential matching procedures. In these cases, we will: (i) provide the third party data match processor only the personal information necessary to perform a match and, infrequently, to assist us performing statistical analyses; (ii) establish procedures and legal obligations that prohibit use of the information received for any other purpose or disclosure of this information to anyone else; and (iii) require destruction of the received information after completion of the match. The information that we obtain from other sources will not include confidential personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and account numbers. Your information is stored in the United States where our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of other countries may differ from those of the United States. Your information may be processed outside of the United States, provided that the data protection laws of such processing location affords similar if not more protections than those afforded in the United States for the processed data.

How is the collected information used?

Market Research Reports: Applying concepts similar to those used by television-rating services, we use the information collected through our application and your survey responses, combined with information from other sources, to make statistically-based projections about current and future Internet user behavior and, more generally, to extrapolate data about potential economic trends. For certain commercial customers, we may provide individual-level information. We make this data available so that these customers may enhance their own understanding of Internet usage and online commercial trends. In all cases, we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers from the data being provided.

Our customers use our market research reports to: (i) modify online services and offerings; (ii) make more effective use of online data to understand both online and offline commercial behavior; and (iii) discern general economic trends and the business performance of specific entities for a wide range of business purposes including, but not limited to, identifying financial investment opportunities and understanding the value and interest in certain business enterprises.

By Service Providers: From time to time, we may share your contact information with those third parties who help us deliver this program to you (for example, companies that administer incentive programs). When we do this, we provide only the necessary information for the service provider to perform its assigned function, and we contractually prohibit the use or disclosure of this information to anyone else unless you authorize it.

As Required by Law: In rare cases, and as is done by any other business, if we are compelled to disclose certain information through a valid legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, or a search warrant, we would do so. However, we would comply by providing only the minimum information necessary.

How is the information secured?

Safeguards: We have implemented a variety of safeguards (including physical, digital, and legal protections) focused on ensuring that the information collected through this program is protected from unauthorized use, modification, or disclosure. For example, any secure information collected by our application is encrypted before it is sent to our servers. Moreover, our employees are subjected to periodic evaluation and investigation, are contractually restricted on their use and access to personally identifiable information, and are educated and retrained as needed on internal security policies and procedures.

If you would like to access, modify, and/or request deletion of the personally identifiable profile information submitted by you as part of this program, you may complete a support form on our website, or e-mail our support staff at the e-mail address provided below.

Are cookies used by your website or your application?

We do not use our cookies to store or acquire data about you; however, we do use cookies to identify you as you go through any required registration processes on our site, and to assist us in conducting occasional diagnostic tests to ensure that our system is functioning correctly. Our cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information about you. Please note that if you configure your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to complete our registration process and enjoy the benefits of being a program participant.

What privacy commitments do you make relating to specific participant benefits?

Please refer to our program’s web site, which lays out the privacy commitments that we make for the various participant benefits we offer. The terms of these commitments are incorporated into this agreement. Please note that each incentive program may have its own set of rules applicable to that particular offering; these rules are made available to you before you choose to participate.

What if I wish to stop participating in this program?

Resignation: You may resign at any time by contacting us at the support address listed below or by selecting the “[Terminate all PermissionResearch Services](https://web.archive.org/web/20080616110115id_/http%3A//www.permissionresearch.com/Remove.aspx?terminate_services=y)” link from the Members section on your panel’s web page (where applicable). 

Removing our Application: You may remove our application using the Windows Add/Remove Programs function (known as “Programs and Features” in Vista). Alternatively, you may e-mail our support staff at the e-mail address provided below and request removal instructions. Please be sure to follow this same removal procedure on all of the computers from which you wish to remove this application. Removing the application will stop tracking of your online browsing and purchasing behavior, but unless you resign from the panel in accordance with the procedure stated above, you still may be contacted for administrative purposes or for special participant opportunities. After you remove our application from a computer, all settings we have made to your computer will be deactivated; however, some inactive elements may remain on your machine such as registry entries or DLL files, which is not at all unusual for many types of online services and software.

Use of Third Party Programs to Remove our Software: Please note that use of third party programs to remove this application may cause instability in your system and to your Internet connection. We reserve the right to repair any of its settings that are partially removed, to minimize potential instability. Should you wish to resign, we ask that you use the instructions provided above.

Stop Participating in Surveys: You may contact us at the support address listed below to alter how you receive, or to completely stop receiving, surveys, or you can edit your survey preferences at the Members section on your panel’s web page (where applicable).

Please note: we may continue to use information collected prior to resignation, but all such information remains fully subject to, and governed by, the agreement effective at the time of your resignation.

What is the policy regarding children?

All persons installing this application must be at least 18 years old and must be the parent or legal guardian of any minor that may use a computer with this application installed. However, all household Internet behavior may be used by us in developing the statistical projections. This program complies with all applicable U.S. data gathering rules, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

How will I be notified of changes to this Agreement?

If we change our practices in how we handle personally identifiable information, or if we materially change other aspects of our program, including but not limited to any changes to the scope or nature of incentives provided, we will post these changes on our website, and the changes will be effective immediately upon such posting.
