                        Perfume2Order.com ("Perfume2Order") respects the privacy of the users of our Internet
                        site. Perfume2Order is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.
                        We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from
                        what is disclosed in this statement. Perfume2Order collects information from our
                        users at several different points on our website. This website takes every precaution
                        to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the
                        website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We also do
                        everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
                        information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in
                        our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
                        example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access
                        to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected
                        screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their
                        password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept
                        up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any
                        time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the
                        importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information
                        is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information
                        on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
