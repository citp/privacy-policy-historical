# Privacy Policy | Perficient, Inc

This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 25, 2018 and applies to any Perficient website regardless of how you access or use such site.  Please note that this policy may be updated, without notice to you, reflecting any changes in the way we handle your personal data or any changes in applicable laws.

Perficient is committed to protecting the privacy of your information and implementing technology that gives you a rewarding and safe online experience. We want you to feel secure when visiting our site and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so.

## **1. What Information We Gather and How We Use It**

Information on Perficient.com and other Perficient websites is gathered in two ways: directly and indirectly. Perficient will at times ask you to directly provide information that personally identifies you (registering for an event, downloading a file, signing up for an email list, etc.). It is our policy to keep personal information only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected.

We do not generally seek to collect sensitive or personal information through this site or in general.  In cases where such data is collected, we do so in accordance with data privacy laws and requirements, and/or ask for your consent. 

We may collect personal data of our employees, potential employees, clients, suppliers, business contacts, shareholders and website users: 

1.1 Information gathered from website users.  Perficient may collect personal information in two ways: (a) directly (e.g., you provide personal data to sign up for events, newsletters or to request information), or (b) indirectly (such as what is gathered through our website’s technology).  Perficient does not require that you provide your personal data in order to receive information about our Services and offerings, but to the extent you have provided such information we may keep a record of that correspondence for continued marketing contact, or for survey or research purposes.  Our website may collect personal data about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration, traffic filtering, statistical reporting or troubleshooting of errors within our systems.  Please see the Cookies section below for more information with regard to how we handle information indirectly collected. 

Perficient may use your personal data to: (i) process online job applications, (ii) fulfill your requests for continued receipt of white papers, articles, newsletters or other content, (iii) for surveys or research questionnaires you have agreed to take part in, (iv) contact you for marketing purposes when you have agreed to this action, and (v) personalize or improve your experience at our website when feedback is provided by you. 

Retention and use of your personal information for the purposes mentioned above is solely based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws. 

1.2 Information used for marketing purposes:  The bulk of personal information Perficient collects and uses for marketing purposes relates to individual employees of our clients and other companies with which we have existing business relationships.  We may also obtain and maintain contact information from other sources, including content made public at social media websites, to make an initial contact with a relevant individual at a potential client or other company.  We may also combine data from publicly-available sources, as well as from our email, website and personal interactions with you to better assess your experience with Perficient. 

Perficient does use customer relationship management database (CRM) technology to manage and track these marketing efforts, which may include personal information belonging to the individuals mentioned above, which could include contact data, publicly available information, your responses to targeted email, website activity of registered users of our website and other business information included by Perficient employees regarding any contact they may have with you. 

If you wish to be excluded from our CRM database, please contact us at [datasecurity@perficient.com](mailto:datasecurity@perficient.com).  Also, you can exercise your rights to refuse any marketing communications by utilizing opt-out mechanisms in emails we send to you.  In such cases, we will retain minimum personal data to note your request(s) in order to avoid contacting you again.

## **2. Information Retention/Destruction**

Perficient may retain your personal information only for as long as necessary, and has policies and processes in place so that such information is deleted after a reasonable period of time according to applicable law.  Such data is retained for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you or for as long as needed to provide services to you, and for as long as needed in order to comply with our global legal and contractual obligations. 

## **3. Cookies and IP Data **

When you visit Perficient.com, your Internet Protocol (IP) address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Your IP address is used to help diagnose any technical problems, analyze site trends, administer the site, track movement within the site, and gather broad demographic information about site use that can eventually be used to make improvements that enhance your user experience on Perficient.com.

Web beacons, conversion pixels and other technologies for similar purposes may be included on these sites, in marketing emails or our newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and links clicked on.  Web beacons do not place information on your device but may work together with cookies to monitor website activity.  The information provided in this Section 3 also applies to this technology.  “Conversion pixels” are small codes located on web page which may be triggered when someone visits a page resulting in an increase in the conversion count. 

Perficient may analyze your IP and browser information to determine what is most effective about our website, to help us identify ways to improve it and, eventually, to determine who we can make improvements to provide a better user experience.
