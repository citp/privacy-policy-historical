**The Software & Services are not intended for minors in any jurisdiction and you hereby represent that you are not a minor according to you relevant jurisdiction. For example, users under the age of 13 in the United States and users under the age of 16 in the European Union are not permitted to use the Software & Services. We do not knowingly collect, use, share or disclose any personal information from minors. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage, so that we can verify that minors are not using the Software & Services.

We advise parents and guardians to regularly monitor their children’s use of email and other online communications and activities. Control tools that create a safer online environment for children are available from third party online services and software providers.

In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a minor is using the Software & Services, we will prohibit and block such a user from accessing the Software & Services and will make all efforts to promptly delete any PII with regard to such user, as applicable.

If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her PII without your consent, please contact us as provided in this Privacy Policy and we will take the necessary steps to remove that information from our database.

**Your Rights.  
**You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through your use of the Software & Services or through your communications with us, and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of this Privacy Policy.

You may also object to further processing of the PII we hold about you or request that we suspend further processing of such PII. You may also withdraw your consent to this Privacy Policy and our processing of your PII at any time noting that such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the withdrawal of your consent. Please note that any objection, suspension or withdrawal of your consent to our processing of PII may affect our ability to continue to provide you with the Software & Services or address your questions, requests or complaints.

In addition, you may request to receive the PII we hold about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and transmit that PII to any third party you wish. Where technically feasible, we can also transmit your PII to such third party upon your written request.

In all such cases, we may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity and any third party recipients of your PII based on your written request.

**Information Obtained from Other Companies.  
**We may license and otherwise obtain various information about you, including PII from various other companies, including research companies, data aggregation companies and other third party companies. Data sets may include information about you or your demographic segment and cross device identifiers associated with the devices that you use. To the extent the information is PII, we process this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including, amongst others, in relation to the stated purposes of processing (which may include the use of automated decision-making algorithms and processes), data retention, cross border transfers, your rights to the data and the right to lodge complaints.

**Data Retention.  
**We retain the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as necessary to fulfill our business and/or operational purposes or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize parts of the information we collect so that it can no longer be identifiable or attributable to any person if we want to keep it for longer periods of time.

**Transfer of Data Outside Your Territory** **.  
**The Software & Services work over the Internet and we may store and process information in various locations throughout the globe. If you are a resident of a European Union Member State or another jurisdiction where transfer of your PII to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you hereby provide us with your express consent to such transfer of your data. In addition, for residents of the European Union, the third parties that receive your PII as described in this Privacy Policy and which are located outside of the European Economic Area are transferred on the basis set forth under applicable law in the European Union.

**Information Security** **.  
**We implement measures to secure your PII that we collect in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute information security. Therefore, although we make efforts to secure your PII, we cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that the Software & Services and its databases are immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions, access or other kinds of abuse and misuse.

**Do Not Track.  
**Do Not Track is a privacy preference that can be configured in certain web browsers (the “ **DNT Feature** “); the DNT Feature, when enabled on a web browser, signals the websites you visit that you do not want certain information about your visit collected. As the Internet industry is in the process of defining how to interpret signals sent by the DNT Features, Perion does not currently respond or recognize DNT Feature signals.

**Complaints.**  
If you have any complaints on our processing of your PII or if you believe that we have breached our own privacy policies or applicable law, we encourage you to contact us. However, please note that applicable EU data protection laws provide you with a right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority as well.

**Notice to Californian Residents – Your California Privacy Rights.  
**California residents who provide us with certain types of personal information (as defined under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as California’s “Shine the Light” law)) are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the personal information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing use.

Prior to any material change to this Privacy Policy, Perion will present you with a detailed notification (e.g. a pop-up notification or other reasonable means) of such change including information on how you may uninstall the Software & Services (to the extent applicable). Other changes, including amendments made to the Policy to comply with legal requirements, will become effective immediately upon their initial posting. Perion will also update the “Last updated” date at the end of this Privacy Policy.
