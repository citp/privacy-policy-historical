We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and log files to track non-personal information about visitors to our Website in the aggregate. We may also share non-personal information with third parties such as advertisers and partners.

We may also release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, court order, or legal process; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, or to protect the rights and/or property of Peacock Gap Golf Club. Additionally, in the unlikely event that the entirety of our business is sold, liquidated, merged, or transferred to a third party, we may transfer all personal and non-personal information to the party purchasing or merging with us.

#### DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY

Occasionally we may invite you to be contacted by third parties whose goods or services may be of interest to you. We will only share your Personal Information with these third parties if you grant us permission to do so. If you opt-in to such sharing, we may also share your Personal Information with licensors of golf products, and/or health-related programs offered on or through our Website.

We may provide third parties with non-personal information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website.

#### DISCLOSURE TO OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to our Website, including but not limited to maintaining an email suppression list as required by state and/or federal law, providing credit card processing and shipping fulfillment, fraud screening, testing and implementation of special services such as those for contacting members, and developing applications for our Website and email services. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personal Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personal Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us.

#### DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTY SELLERS

Through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to obtain more information) regarding certain content, products or services which are sold through a person or company other than us or our Affiliates (collectively, "Third Party Sellers"). In addition, if you purchase a product or service through one of our co-branded stores (rather than through our Online Store), you will likely be purchasing the product through a Third Party Seller, not from us. We will attempt to notify you when you are dealing with a Third Party Seller by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website. For example, if you see a phrase such as "powered by" or "brought to you by" followed by the name of a person or company other than Peacock Gap Golf Club, then you are likely on, or about to enter, a website hosted or operated by a person or company other than us. Third Party Sellers may request that you submit certain Personal Information (e.g., name and address for shipment purposes) to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them. Alternatively, we may offer the products or services of these Third Party Sellers elsewhere on our Website. If you should make a purchase of these products or services, we will transmit your purchase data and your Personal Information to the Third Party Seller so that the transaction can be processed.

If you do not wish for a Third Party Seller to have access to your Personal Information, please do not make a purchase in our Online Store (or elsewhere on our Website). By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third Party Seller. This information is used by the Third Party Seller and may be subject to a different privacy policy. We do not otherwise share or disclose your Personal Information to Third Party Sellers unless you give us permission to do so.

#### DISCLOSURE TO LINKED SITES

In addition to the third party websites that you may access as described above, for your convenience there may be links to websites operated by companies other than Peacock Gap Golf Club ("Third Party Websites") that are not contractors who provide content or services through our Website. These links may be found in advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of sponsors. Peacock Gap Golf Club does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Websites without obtaining your consent. In addition, Peacock Gap Golf Club does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these websites. If you choose to link to one of these Third party Websites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that Third Party Website collects and uses your Personal Information.

#### OTHER DISCLOSURES

We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, liquidation, merger, or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Peacock Gap Golf Club. We will endeavor, in good faith, to gain the third party's agreement and adherence to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In addition, we will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our Website and through email.

#### HOW PEACOCK GAP GOLF CLUB HANDLES SECURITY

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
