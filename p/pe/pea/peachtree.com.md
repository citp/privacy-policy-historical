#### Business Information Collected By Peachtree

Peachtree collects the Business Information necessary to enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services and to send you information regarding our products and services from time to time. Since most of the users of our products and Sites are doing so in their capacity as employees or companies, most Business Information we collect will be in that capacity (rather than information about personal tastes, etc.). For these purposes, we have defined "Business Information" as any information that identifies or may identify a specific individual or a company or that allows others to contact a specific individual or a company.

**Peachtree.com.** When you visit Peachtree.com, you may be asked to submit information via Peachtree Passport such as e-mail address, company name, address and phone, and your product interest areas. This information is collected to help us process your requests for information.

**Product Registration.** You may be asked, on behalf of your company, to complete registration form(s) on our Sites with contact information for use by Peachtree. Registration information may include name of company, product purchased, product serial number, customer ID, and other relevant information. We may use this information in order to identify you easily within our systems, or to display information that we maintain about your company via our accounting applications.

We may display your company information in our accounting applications via the My Peachtree Account feature as a service to you so you have a record of your account with Peachtree (such as the products and services you have purchased.)

**Ask A Question.** If you submit a question via the Ask A Question function in our accounting products, information about your network, operating system, printer, data and program path, product type, version, customer ID, the product's technical support information sheet and product serial number will be passed to a form that will be pre-populated for you. Information you submit on this form will give our customer support representatives the background data on your Peachtree setup so they can be prepared to answer your question.

**Peachtree Today.** With respect to the Peachtree Today component of our desktop application products ("Peachtree Today"), Peachtree allows customers to download updates to their desktop Peachtree solution as they become available. Peachtree Today also allows a level of customization when accessing various components. When you download such updates or access these components, we assign you a unique identifier and collect certain information necessary to enable us to provide you with the appropriate update or customized information. This information includes product serial number, product type, and product version. 

**My Peachtree.** The My Peachtree section of Peachtree Today allows you to access and monitor your relationship with Peachtree by viewing your support plan status, service subscriptions and registrations, and order history. We collect various information such as product serial number, customer ID, and Passport information to correctly identify you and give you access to your account information.

**ePeachtree and Peachtree Web Accounting.** Upon registering and using the ePeachtree Accounting and the Peachtree Web Accounting services, we collect various information (in addition to the information collected on the Registration form) which includes IP Address, Browser, Connection Speed, Domain, Referring URL and other environment related information. This information is used to 1) provide a secure environment for the use of these services and 2) compute statistical information about the customers using these services in aggregate form. Where applicable, we also collect credit card and billing information to enable us to bill you for these services.

**Peachtree WebsiteCreator, Peachtree WebsiteCreator Pro, and Peachtree WebsiteTrader.** Upon subscribing to the Peachtree WebsiteCreator, Peachtree WebsiteCreator Pro, and WebsiteTrader services, we collect certain information that includes e-mail address, business name, and number of employees. We use this information to set up your Peachtree WebsiteCreator account. Where applicable we also collect credit card and billing information to enable us to bill you for these services.

**Peachtree Online Backup.** Our Peachtree Online Backup Service partner collects information from you such as business name and address, e-mail address, credit card information, and customer ID in order to set up your service. This information is passed back to Peachtree on a regular basis so that we can bill you for the service. In addition, Peachtree maintains access to this information so that we can support you technically on the service.

**Peachtree Direct Deposit.** Peachtree collects the information needed to successfully route your direct deposit transactions or verify your credit history. This information may include federal ID number, bank account, aggregate payroll, credit card information, and contact information for your business.

**Newsletters.** When you subscribe or sign up to receive newsletters published or offered by Peachtree we will ask you for information necessary to enable us to process your request or to send you information regarding our products and services.

**Cookies.** We also use Cookies to enhance the user experience, deliver personalized content and collect information about the use of our site.

### ARTICLE 3

#### How Peachtree Protects Your Privacy Internally

**Peachtree.com.** Peachtree wants your business information to remain as secure as reasonably possible. We combine industry-standard technical safeguards with a code of conduct for those employees that are permitted to access our customers' business information. When you purchase a product or service online, Peachtree uses SSL encryption to encrypt your credit card information before it is sent to us, in order to ensure the integrity and privacy of credit card information that you provide to us via the Internet.

ePeachtree, Peachtree Web Accounting and Peachtree Direct Deposit are hosted on servers that are CO-located at a 3rd party facility, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures. For example, your Accounting Data will be submitted via SSL encryption and stored on a separate server equipped with industry standard firewalls. Your Accounting Data is maintained in a separate database that is stored separately from the information of other customers. In addition, the hosting facility provides 24 X 7 security guards, camera surveillance, biometric scanning and locked cage areas.

On the employee side, every Peachtree employee is trained on our privacy and security procedures. Only authorized Peachtree employees, agents or independent contractors are permitted to access your Business Information or Accounting Data, and all such employees, agents or independent contractors must agree in writing to abide by our Privacy Statement. Those employees that violate our Privacy Statement are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Despite these security measures, Peachtree does not represent or warrant that Business Information will be protected against loss, misuse, attacks, or alteration by third parties.
