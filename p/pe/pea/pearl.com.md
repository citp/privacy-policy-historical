Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement will have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Service.

**Principle 1: Information We Collect**

You may browse the Pearl.com site without providing any PII. If you choose to provide us with your PII, you are agreeing to the processing and storage of your information in the United States and countries outside of the United States which may have data protection laws that differ from laws in your country.

Pearl.com explicitly asks when it needs PII. To help facilitate the question and response process, and the payment of Professionals via PayPal™, Pearl.com requires basic data such as email address. To obtain payments from Customers, Pearl.com asks for either credit card information or PayPal™ email address, at the Customer's election. Professional applicants and/or referral participants may be asked for additional information, such as full names, addresses, telephone numbers, professional license and certification information, and payment-related information. Professionals who win prizes on the site may be required to provide shipment addresses. If you choose to have Pearl.com notify you of responses to your questions via text message, you will be asked for your cellular phone number and cellular phone company. Other PII may be requested in certain circumstances or collected on a voluntary basis such as on users' profile or signature pages. If you are a referral participant and elect to receive payments via check, we will receive all information necessary to distribute a check to you, such as your name and mailing address. ****

**As explained in the Pearl.com Terms of Service, information provided by you in the content of your questions, answers, and other posts on the Site, in Professional profiles describing your experiences and qualifications, and in signatures attached to postings on the Site ("Posts") is not private or confidential. This is an Internet-based forum (akin to a modern version of a radio call-in program) and information submitted in Posts may be read, collected, and used by others, and Pearl.com is not responsible for it.   For example, search engines may index your questions, answers, and other Posts to allow them to appear in search engine results (e.g. if someone does a search on google.com, your questions, answers, and other Posts on Pearl.com that relate to the search may appear in the google.com search results list). Protect your anonymity by not including your real name or any PII in your questions, answers, and other Posts on the Site.**

In some cases, Pearl.com supplements portions of the PII you provide with other data received from third parties, or data sent to us from your web browser including (depending on its settings) your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data ("Usage Statistics").

To enhance and individualize your experience with Pearl.com, we use a web browser feature called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior user and, if you wish, retrieve your username and password so you do not need to enter them again. Cookies are not used to store other personal information. Pearl.com also uses cookies to maintain state. That is, each time you logon, our system issues your browser a unique, randomly generated number by which it can identify itself. In that way, your data gets sent to you and not someone else. You must activate cookies to logon to Pearl.com.

The use of cookies by any partners, affiliates, or other service providers (“Third Parties”) is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These Third Parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to Customer PII.

  * serves to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of Pearl.com, its users, or others;
  * to any other third party with your consent to do so; or
  * enforces the Pearl.com Terms of Service or related Agreements.

All PII is password protected. All passwords use 160 bit encryption.

Pearl.com uses 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL) technology and digital certificates to encrypt and authenticate transactions (credit card and other payments). SSL creates a secured connection between our web servers and your browser, which protects against unauthorized access to transmitted data and supports data being sent only to intended recipients.

Our database logs important changes so that unauthorized transactions can be quickly reversed.

Our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading provider of Internet access to enterprises with mission-critical Internet application requirements. Access to the host environment is highly secure. Biometric scanning, 24/7 onsite staff monitoring, and other safeguards are utilized. In addition, back-up servers that are stripped of email addresses, passwords, and credit card information are located in an office that is locked outside of normal business hours.

We retain your account information and the information provided by you in the form of Posts until such time that we determine it has no further commercial significance, at which time we may delete and/or aggregate and store it in aggregate form indefinitely.
