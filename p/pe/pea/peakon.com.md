**DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We may share your personal data with other companies in our group, where necessary or desirable to do so in the course of the provision of services to you or your employer or in the course of undertaking marketing activities. 

We may also share your personal data with selected third parties in accordance with this policy, including:

  * service providers, for example of IT services, business partners, suppliers and/or sub-contractors, for the performance of any contract that we enter into with your employer (such as the Employer Agreement) or in the course of undertaking marketing activities, including the following:


  *     * Amazon Web Services, Inc and Heroku, Inc; who provide cloud hosted infrastructure and services used by us to operate the Platform as a hosted solution;


  *     * Google LLC, Delighted, Inc, Intercom, Inc. and Nexmo, Inc, who provide product tools and functionality used by us in delivery of the Platform and associated services; and


  *     * Salesforce and Marketo, who provide marketing and CRM management and delivery services.


  * analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our marketing activities and the analysis of data supplied via the Platform for contact enrichment and lead generation purposes, including Google Analytics, LinkedIn, Facebook and Clearbit; and


  * government or other law enforcement agencies, in connection with the investigation of unlawful activities or for other legal reasons (this may include your location information).



We require all our third party service providers and all other companies within our group to take appropriate and stringent security measures to protect your personal data in line with our policies. We do not allow our third party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes in accordance with our instructions.

We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties in the following circumstances:

  * if we sell or buy any business assets or receive investment into our business, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective or actual buyer, seller or investee of such business or assets;


  * if Peakon ApS or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us, including your data and data about our customers, suppliers and correspondents will be one of the transferred assets; 


  * we may disclose your personal data to our legal advisers if they need to have access to this information in order to advise us on our legal rights and obligations; and


  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other contracts between us and you or your employer; or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers or others. 



If you are a Survey Recipient please note that:

  * feedback and comments provided by you during engagement surveys are collated and conveyed to your employer in an aggregated or otherwise anonymised form.  As such, your anonymity as a Survey Recipient is protected by default. Please also note that we merely report the feedback and comments and do not undertake any investigation or assessment into their veracity or legality; 


  * the Platform may include an automated keyword flagging function, using a list of keywords which are pre-agreed by your employer.  Any word in comments contained in an engagement survey which matches a keyword is automatically reported to your employer, without revealing your identity. We do not, however, notify you when any keywords originating from you are reported to your employer. This keyword flagging function operates automatically and we do not carry out any manual checks or otherwise monitor, supervise or exercise any discretion over the transmission of keywords to your employer. We do not assume any responsibility to you (in your capacity as a Survey Recipient) in respect of the keyword flagging function, and we expressly disclaim, to the fullest extent permissible by law, any and all responsibility and liability in respect of (a) any failure or delay by us in reporting keywords, and (b) any acts or omissions of your employer as a consequence of or in connection with the reporting of such keywords;


  * from time to time we may receive a request from your employer to disclose your identity or we may consider it appropriate to disclosure your identity in the absence of such a request.  We will consider this in accordance with our internal policy on revealing anonymity.  Your identity will in general only be disclosed to your employer where it is necessary to do so for reasons of substantial public interest.  This is only likely to occur in exceptional circumstances.  For example, we may consider (based on your or others’ comments) that you or another person identified is experiencing or at risk of physical, mental or emotional harm (including self-harm) and requires support, and that there is a need to protect the well-being of you or another person, and furthermore that we cannot reasonably obtain your consent (for instance if you are away from your workplace and therefore not contactable for a period of time) or where seeking your consent would prejudice the purpose of the disclosure.  By way of further example, we may consider (based on your or others’ comments) that disclosure of your identity to your employer is necessary to prevent or detect an unlawful act (such as fraud or other criminal act), and that we cannot request your consent since this would prejudice the purpose of the disclosure.



Except as explained above, we will not disclose your personal data to any third parties for any other purpose unless we have a legal right or obligation to do so.

**INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**

A number of our service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”), predominantly in the United States.  We may transfer your personal data to those services providers in the United States or other countries outside the EEA in order to provide our services via the Platform or (in respect of Marketing Contacts) in order to undertake marketing activities.

We have put in place appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data are treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU laws on data protection:, including verifying that the recipient is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, or in putting in place written contractual agreements to meet EU-approved data protection obligations.  If you require further information about these protective measures, please contact us at privacy@peakon.com.

**SECURITY OF INFORMATION**

You will not ordinarily require a username or password to gain access to or complete a survey or otherwise provide us with information via the Platform. Where we have given you a username, password and/or security information which enables you to access particular features of the Platform (for example, as an administrator or senior manager of your employer), you are responsible for keeping these access credentials confidential. You must not share these details with anyone, or store them in a way that may allow a third party to access them. Please see the Terms of Use for more details on not sharing your access credential with third parties and how doing so may affect your ability to use the Platform: <https://peakon.com/terms-of-use/>.

We maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that an appropriate level of security in respect of all personal data we process. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Platform and you acknowledge that any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features which are appropriate to the type of personal data you have provided to try to prevent unauthorised access or inadvertent disclosure, which may include two factor authentication and end-to-end encryption.

**YOUR CONSENT**

Where consent is required for our use of your personal data, by ticking the appropriate consent box or otherwise communicating your consent to us (whether by phone, email or other means), you consent to our use of that personal data as set out in this policy. If you disclose someone else's personal data to us, you confirm that you have their consent to disclose this to us and for us to use and disclose it in accordance with this policy.

**RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION**

We will not store your personal data for longer than is reasonably necessary to use it in accordance with this policy or with our legal rights and obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, aggregated and anonymised data and any information other than personal data can be stored indefinitely.

In particular:

  * For Survey Recipients and Client Users: we will retain your personal data for a period of 5 years or until six months after our relationship with your employer has ended (whichever is sooner). After this period, your personal data will be anonymised or deleted. 


  * For Marketing Contacts: we will retain your personal data for a period for so long as necessary to continue to provide you with updates or other marketing emails or other communications in circumstances in which you have consented (where necessary) or else not unsubscribed to receiving such communications and in which we have a continued legitimate interest in undertaking that marketing.



**YOUR RIGHTS   **

You have the following rights in regards to your personal information:

  * **Access.** You have the right to access information about the personal data we hold about you. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee in response to unreasonable or repetitive requests, or requests for further copies of the same information.


  * **Right to object to processing.**   You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is being undertaken by us on the basis of our (or a third party’s) legitimate interest.  In such a case we are required to cease processing your data unless we can demonstrate compelling grounds which override your objection.  You also have the right to object at any time to the processing by us of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.


  * **Rectification.** You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate personal data that we hold about you.


  * **Erasure.**   You have the right to request that we erase any personal data that we hold about you, based on one of a number of grounds, including the withdrawal of your consent (where our processing of that data is undertaken on the basis of your consent), or if your object to our continued processing (as mentioned above).  This right does not extend to information which is not personal data. Please also note that it is likely to be necessary for us to retain your personal data for the purposes of assessing and verifying data that is submitted and/or held on the Platform, and your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly. We also reserve the right to retain your personal data in an anonymised form for statistical and benchmarking purposes.


  * **Request to restriction of processing.** This enables you to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.


  * **Portability.** You have the right to obtain copies of your personal data to enable you to reuse your personal data across different services and with different companies. You may also request that your personal data is transmitted directly to another organisation where this is technically feasible using our data processing systems.


  * **Change of preferences.** You can change your data processing preferences at any time. For example, if you have given your consent to direct marketing, but have changed your mind, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications by emailing us at [support@peakon.com](mailto:support@peakon.com) or clicking the relevant link in any communication you receive.



You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Please note that if you exercise any of the above rights to require us to restrict or cease processing or to delete personal data, and this type of processing is required in order to facilitate your use of the Platform, you will no longer be able to use the Platform following the date on which we action your request.  This does not include your right to object to direct marketing which can be exercised at any time without restriction. **Please allow at least 5 working days for your request to be actioned.**

Save as set out above, your rights detailed above can be exercised free of charge in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please contact your employer directly if you would like to exercise any of these rights (other than a change to your marketing preferences, which should be notified directly to us as described above).

If for any reason you are not happy with the way that we have handled your personal data, you also have the right to make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority in your country.  In the UK, the relevant authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office.
