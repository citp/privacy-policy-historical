What this Policy covers
    

The data controller is Peacocks Stores Ltd (referred to in this policy as “we” or “us”). 

We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data. That’s why this privacy and cookies policy (“Policy”) has been developed, which:

  * sets out the types of personal data that we collect
  * explains how and why we collect and use your personal data
  * explains when and why we will share personal data within and with other organisations; and
  * explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data

Our Websites may contain links to other websites operated by other organisations that have their own privacy policies. Please make sure you read the terms and conditions and privacy policy carefully before providing any personal data on a website as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for websites of other organisations.

Sharing personal data within the EWM Group
    

This section explains how and why we share personal data with other companies within the EWM Group.

We may share the personal data we collect with other companies in the EWM Group. For example, we share personal data within our Group for order fulfillment, fraud prevention and group reporting.

## Sharing personal data with Retail Partners and Service Providers

This section explains how and why we share personal data with Retail Partners and Service Providers.

When we share personal data with these companies we require them to keep it safe, and they must not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.

### Retail partners

We work with a number of Retail Partners who –

  * sell products through our Services, for example Yodel; or
  * offer products, services and/or discounts.



We only share personal data that enable our Retail Partners to provide their services. For example, when you place an order with Peacocks Stores, we will give the relevant Retail Partner, for example Yodel, your name and contact details so that they can deliver your items.

### Service Providers

We work with carefully selected Service Providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. These include, for example, companies that help us with technology services, storing and combining data, processing payments and delivering orders. We only share personal data that enable our Service Providers to provide their services.

Some of the Service Providers we work with operate online media channels, and they place relevant online advertising for our products and services, on those online media channels on our behalf. For example, you may see an advert for our products and services as you use a particular social media site or watch television through your pay TV account.

Sharing personal data with other organisations
    

This section explains how and why we share personal data with other organisations.

We may share personal data with other organisations in the following circumstances:

  * if the law or a public authority says we must share the personal data;
  * if we need to share personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (this includes providing personal data to others for the purposes of preventing fraud and reducing credit risk);
  * to an organisation we sell or transfer (or enter into negotiations to sell or transfer) any of our businesses or any of our rights or obligations under any agreement we may have with you to. If the transfer or sale goes ahead, the organisation receiving your personal data can use your personal data in the same way as us; or
  * to any other successors in title to our business.



How we protect personal data
    

We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data. This section sets out some of the measures we have in place.

We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, and we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files to keep this data safe. We only authorise access to employees who need it to carry out their job responsibilities.

  * We protect the security of your information while it is being transmitted by encrypting it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
  * We enforce physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal data. We may occasionally ask for proof of identity before we share your personal data with you.
  * We will reveal only the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order.



However, whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data that you transfer over the internet to us.

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by companies operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. We will put in place appropriate protection to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected and is treated in line with this Policy.

Marketing and market research
    

This section explains the choices you have when it comes to receiving marketing communications and taking part in market research.

We will send you relevant offers and news about our products and services in a number of ways including by email, but only if you have previously agreed to receive these marketing communications. When you register with us we will ask if you would like to receive marketing communications, and you can change your marketing choices online, over the phone or in writing at any time.

We also like to hear your views to help us to improve our Services, so we may contact you for market research purposes. You always have the choice about whether to take part in our market research.

Your Rights
    

## Your rights in connection with personal information

We want to make sure that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up to date. If any of the details are incorrect, please let us know and we will amend them.

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

  * Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request" or "SAR"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Complete the form below; 
  * Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
  * Request the erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to stop processing personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
  * Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * Request the transfer of your personal information to another party. 



If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact;

## No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive, repetitive or vexatious. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

## What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

## Right to withdraw consent

In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact [online-customer-services@peacocks.co.uk](mailto:online-customer-services@peacocks.co.uk). Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.
