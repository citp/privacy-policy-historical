This notice is describes our privacy policy. <b>By visiting peakdesign.com and/or peakdesignltd.com, you are accepting the practices described within.</b></p>
<div class="linesmall"></div>
<h2>What information do we collect, and how do you opt out?</h2>

When you purchase Capture<sup>®</sup> through our website, we collect your name and shipping address, as well as phone number and email address. All of these pieces of information are necessary to have in order to ship your order. We do not share any of your contact information with anybody other than our 3rd party order fulfillment vendors (see “Do we disclose any information to outside parties?” below). Although you may submit credit card information at the time you make a purchase, Peak Design does not collect or store that information. All credit card transactions are entirely handled by Paypal.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong><br>
We use Google Analytics to track the volume and type of traffic that comes to our website. When you access this website Google may collect information such as cookies, IP address, search keywords, session length, browser type, page views and number of visits. None of this information is personally identifiable, and is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy.&nbsp;You have the option to opt out of our Google Analytics by opting out in your <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Control Panel</a> or in the global <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">ad network privacy</a>. You can also install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on</a> in your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Remarketing via Adroll</strong><br>
We use a service called Adroll (www.adroll.com) to create online ads for our products. As you browse peakdesignltd.com, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what products you are interested in.&nbsp; Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with peakdesignltd.com.

<div class="linesmall"></div>
<h2>How does Google Analytics work?</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is Google’s web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how their visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics collects information anonymously, and much like examining footprints in sand, it reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. The cookie is used to store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. A different cookie is used for each website, and visitors are not tracked across multiple sites. Analytics requires that all websites that use it must update their privacy policy to include a notice that fully discloses the use of Analytics. To disable this type of cookie, some browsers will indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis. In addition to declining cookies, you can also install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on</a> in your browser, which prevents Google Analytics from collecting information about your website visits.</p>
<div class="linesmall"></div>
