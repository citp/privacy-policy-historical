</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Except as explained above, we will not disclose your personal data to any third parties for any other purpose unless we have a legal right or obligation to do so.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You will not ordinarily require a username or password to gain access to or complete a survey or otherwise provide us with information via the Platform. Where we have given you a username, password and/or security information which enables you to access particular features of the Platform (for example, as an administrator or senior manager of your employer), you are responsible for keeping these access credentials confidential. You must not share these details with anyone, or store them in a way that may allow a third party to access them. Please see the Terms of Use for more details on not sharing your access credential with third parties and how doing so may affect your ability to use the Platform: <a href="https://peakon.com/terms-of-use/">https://peakon.com/terms-of-use/</a>.</span></p>

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features which are appropriate to the type of personal data you have provided to try to prevent unauthorised access or inadvertent disclosure, which may include two factor authentication and end-to-end encryption.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>YOUR CONSENT</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where consent is required for our use of your personal data, by ticking the appropriate consent box or otherwise communicating your consent to us (whether by phone, email or other means), you consent to our use of that personal data as set out in this policy. If you disclose someone else's personal data to us, you confirm that you have their consent to disclose this to us and for us to use and disclose it in accordance with this policy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will not store your personal data for longer than is reasonably necessary to use it in accordance with this policy or with our legal rights and obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, aggregated and anonymised data and any information other than personal data can be stored indefinitely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In particular:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1">For Survey Recipients and Client Users: we will retain your personal data for a period of 5 years or until six months after our relationship with your employer has ended (whichever is sooner). After this period, your personal data will be anonymised or deleted. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1">For Marketing Contacts: we will retain your personal data for a period for so long as necessary to continue to provide you with updates or other marketing emails or other communications in circumstances in which you have consented (where necessary) or else not unsubscribed to receiving such communications and in which we have a continued legitimate interest in undertaking that marketing.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>YOUR RIGHTS&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have the following rights in regards to your personal information:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Access.</b> You have the right to access information about the personal data we hold about you. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee in response to unreasonable or repetitive requests, or requests for further copies of the same information.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li7"><span class="s1"><b>Right to object to processing.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is being undertaken by us on the basis of our (or a third party’s) legitimate interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In such a case we are required to cease processing your data unless we can demonstrate compelling grounds which override your objection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You also have the right to object at any time to the processing by us of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Rectification. </b>You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate personal data that we hold about you.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Erasure.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You have the right to request that we erase any personal data that we hold about you, based on one of a number of grounds, including the withdrawal of your consent (where our processing of that data is undertaken on the basis of your consent), or if your object to our continued processing (as mentioned above).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This right does not extend to information which is not personal data. Please also note that it is likely to be necessary for us to retain your personal data for the purposes of assessing and verifying data that is submitted and/or held on the Platform, and your rights under applicable law to request erasure may be limited accordingly. We also reserve the right to retain your personal data in an anonymised form for statistical and benchmarking purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Request to restriction of processing.</b> This enables you to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Portability.</b> You have the right to obtain copies of your personal data to enable you to reuse your personal data across different services and with different companies. You may also request that your personal data is transmitted directly to another organisation where this is technically feasible using our data processing systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Change of preferences.</b> You can change your data processing preferences at any time. For example, if you have given your consent to direct marketing, but have changed your mind, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@peakon.com">support@peakon.com</a> or clicking the relevant link in any communication you receive.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please note that if you exercise any of the above rights to require us to restrict or cease processing or to delete personal data, and this type of processing is required in order to facilitate your use of the Platform, you will no longer be able to use the Platform following the date on which we action your request.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This does not include your right to object to direct marketing which can be exercised at any time without restriction. <b>Please allow at least 5 working days for your request to be actioned.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Save as set out above, your rights detailed above can be exercised free of charge in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please contact your employer directly if you would like to exercise any of these rights (other than a change to your marketing preferences, which should be notified directly to us as described above).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If for any reason you are not happy with the way that we have handled your personal data, you also have the right to make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority in your country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the UK, the relevant authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office.</span></p>
