### What We Gather

Users access the Peanut Labs platform via third-party partner websites (“Partners”), where users have already completed the Partner’s registration process.  Any personal information the Partner may have collected as part of the Partner registration process is not shared with Peanut Labs.  We do, however, obtain some personal information directly from Users on the Peanut Labs platform during the Peanut Labs registration process that helps to identify the types of studies most in line with a person’s buying habits, interests, or product usage. In order to participate in surveys that are relevant to them, participants need to fill out general consumer information and limited personal information. For instance; if we are looking to conduct a survey among coffee drinkers, we would only choose those persons who indicated in their registration that they drink coffee products. We also ask demographic information (e.g., gender, birth date, household income, and zip or country code). We may require a user’s email address in order to contact the user with reward details upon completing surveys. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which aclient has engaged Peanut Labs, and in some instances, to contact users with reward details.  We may share individual User information collected during the Peanut Labs registration process with the Partner from whose site the User is accessing the Peanut Labs platform.

When publishers visit the site [www.peanutlabs.com](http://www.peanutlabs.com/), we collect personal information from them including but not limited to name, email address, bank account number and social security number.
