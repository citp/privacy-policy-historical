** Privacy Policy  
**

**1\. Introduction  
**

Language Testing (LT), a division of Pearson Education Ltd (Company Number 872828), of 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, a Pearson company, (“we”, “us”) has adopted the following Privacy Policy applicable to personal information that it may collect, store and use in the context of the provision of services related to language tests.

This Privacy Policy is accessible from [www.pearsonpte.com](https://web.archive.org/) and [www.pearsonvue.com/pte](http://www.pearsonvue.com/pte). When the Privacy Policy refers to “this website” it means either of the websites referred to above, depending on which one you accessed the Privacy Policy from, unless otherwise stated. We mainly collect or receive personal information to communicate with users about our services and to provide these services. Users can either be test takers signing up for our tests or individuals at institutions/organizations that recognize Pearson Tests of English qualifications. Both these types of users access this Privacy Policy from <http://www.pearsonvue.com/pte>. Users can also be visitors of [www.pearsonpte.com](https://web.archive.org/), where they will provide their personal data to LT when they sign up to the services offered from the website (i.e. sending inquiries, participating in discussion forums, etc). This Privacy Policy applies equally to the personal data of test takers, individuals at institutions/organizations and visitors, unless otherwise stated. 

The personal data we collect is limited to the information that we require to provide the services that you sign up for and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We will handle and process all personal information collected and received by us from this website in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with UK Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998.

2\. Type of information collected

If you are a test taker

**We will only collect and process your personal data for the purposes that we describe in this Privacy Policy, providing personal data is voluntary. However, on occasions, there will be a minimum data that we need to collect from you for the services that you sign up to. We will let you know what data we require, if you wish to use our services, by indicating in the relevant fields of the webforms.

When you register with us and when you book the time to sit a test, we will ask some questions about your personal, academic and professional background and your habits. This is so that we can continue to improve our tests and send you information that may be of interest to you in the future. The request of accommodations to take the test (e.g. wheelchair access, computer screen magnifier, etc.) may require the collection of sensitive data to support the application. 

On the day of the test, we will collect your photograph, and finger print (or, alternatively, the palm vein pattern) so that we can be satisfied that it is you who is sitting the test and for fraud detection purposes. This is a usual practice in the sector of test providers and the data will only be kept for the period for which your score is valid (i.e. two years) or perhaps less as local regulations may require. 

We will also collect a spoken personal introduction from you on the day of the test so that institutions can use it as an element to assess your level of spoken English. 

In addition, the test centers will use CCTV recording to monitor any possible infringement of the Test Taker Handbook and Test Taker’s Rules, address future claims regarding the test and for the purposes of managing the security of the building. **
