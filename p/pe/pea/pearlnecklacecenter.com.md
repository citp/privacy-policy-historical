  5. We may occasionally contact you by email with information about other products and/or Web Sites we feel may be of interest to you, based upon the purchases you have previously made from us.

If you wish to delete such cookies after visiting the site, go to your browser’s tools menu and select the ‘clear cookies’ option.  

  8. In order to ensure our Web Site is of as much value to as many people as possible, we use a range of analytics tools.
