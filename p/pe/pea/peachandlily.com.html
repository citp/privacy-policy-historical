<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Thank you for
visiting the Peach and Lily website. Peach and Lily, Inc. (“Peach and
Lily,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is
committed to protecting your privacy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We
at Peach and Lily created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we
know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and
shared.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy relates to
the information collection and use practices of Peach and Lily in connection
with our website located at <b><a href="http://www.peachandlily.com/">www.peachandlily.com</a>
</b>(the “Site”), and the Service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By visiting our Site and/or using
our Service, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the
accompanying Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy
shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>Information We Collect</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>We do not collect any personal information from you unless
you voluntarily provide it to us. The
information that we may collect on the Site allows us to improve your shopping
experience by catering to your personal preferences. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you sign up to become a
Registered User, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal
information, such as your name, email address, postal address, credit card and
other payment related information. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of
this information as “Personal Information.” </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Like most web sites, we use automatic data
collection technology when you visit our Site to record information that
identifies your computer, to track your use of our Site, and to collect certain
basic information about you and your surfing habits. This information includes
information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and
language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of
time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and
similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Service (the “Usage
Information”).&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>We may collect this Usage Information
by using cookies. Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on
your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information
about your visit. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided
in your Internet provider’s “help” file.&nbsp;
If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able
to use some areas of the Site and/or the Service. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>We do not collect personally identifying information
in this way, but if you’ve provided us with personally identifying information
we may associate that information with the information that is collected
automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our
services providers.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>How We Use Your Information</u></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>

<p><span>We may use your
Personal Information and the Usage Information in a manner that is consistent
with this Privacy Policy and the context of our relationship with you. We will
use the personally identifying information collected on this Site for the
following purposes:</span></p>

<ol>
  <li>To respond to your
requests and to provide you with the Service;</li>
  <li>To respond to your
inquiries and contact you about changes to this Site;</li>
  <li>To send you notices
(for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like) regarding
products or services you are receiving, and for billing and collection
purposes;</li>
  <li>For any other
purposes disclosed at the time the information is collected or to which you consent;
and</li>
  <li>As otherwise
specifically described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
</ul>









<p><span>We
may also use your information to improve our Site, and may use cookies and
other information to enable us to customize your user experience.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>We may also share
personal information, demographic information, and purchase history that you
provide to Peach and Lily with our strategic partners, such as suppliers and
distributors, in order to select the best products for you and our customers. Any
strategic partners that are given access to your personal information is
contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information
shared with them and to strictly use the information to perform the services
that we ask them to provide to us and you. </p>

<p>We may provide aggregate statistics,
which do not include personal information, about our customers, sales, traffic
patterns and related Site information to reputable third party vendors.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We, like many
businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related
functions.&nbsp; Examples include mailing
information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing
payments.&nbsp; When we employ another company
