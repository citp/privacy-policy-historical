We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) about you.

By using the Sites, you expressly accept and agree to be bound and abide by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the Sites.

  2. **Changes to This Policy**



Buyouts Insider may at any time change this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes in our practices, service offerings, or market regulations. If the policy is updated, we will update the Effective Date at the top of the policy. Your continued use of Buyouts Insider after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

  3. **Information We Collect About You**



Buyouts Insider gathers information about its users mainly to enhance their experience on the Sites. This information is used to bring you content that is relevant to your interests. Additionally, Buyouts Insider, along with our advertising partners, may collect information about you anonymously to provide you with targeted advertising messages that are catered to your location, interests, and the Sites behaviors. You can opt out of information gathering for advertising purposes with certain of our third-party partners below. This collected information includes 1) personal information you provide to us and 2) non-personal information we automatically collect through technology.

A) Personal Information You Provide To Buyouts Insider

When using the Sites, you may provide Buyouts Insider with PII, including but not limited to:

  * User names (including social media user names)
  * Correspondence with Buyouts Insider staff
  * Billing Information (for paid Buyouts Insider products)
  * Contact information for Buyouts Insider event tickets



You may also provide information to be published or displayed on public areas of the Sites (“User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted on the Sites at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Sites who view your User Contributions or with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

If you are a Registered User and under the age of 18 years old, Buyouts Insider allows you to request removal of your User Contributions. For more information on the removal of User Contributions, see our Terms of Use.

You are not required to provide Buyouts Insider with any PII in order to use the Sites. Certain PII you provide to us can be updated through the account settings of registered users. PII that is collected is the sole property of Buyouts Insider, and that information is not distributed to third parties unless required by law.

B) Non-Personal Information We Automatically Collect About You

This type of information is collected anonymously through the use of technology, such as third-party cookies, web beacons, and other similar methods. No PII is collected through these methods. Non-personal information we automatically collect may include, but is not limited to:

C) Information Third-Parties Collect About You

None of the information collected by these sources contains any PII. Information third parties collect about you includes but is not limited to:

  * Demographic information (gender, age, HHI, job title, interests, etc.)
  * Advertising information (clicks, interactions, post-impression performance data)
  * Social networking information (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
  * Research information (data collected from partners such as Nielsen, Comscore, Quantcast, etc.)

Sites Analysis: Buyouts Insider uses the information collected through third-party sources to learn and analyze how the Sites are used. We use this information to enhance the Sites by making improvements based on the data collected.

  5. **How We Share Information Collected**



There are very few specific circumstances when your information is shared outside of the company. These circumstances include but are not limited to:

  * If you post User Contributions or use social media applications in conjunction with the Sites, the information you submit (including your social media user name) is viewable to the public.
  * Buyouts Insider may need to disclose PII to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or any other legal process.
  * We employ third-party services to distribute email newsletters, and these third-parties have access to specific information only for the purposes of fulfilling contracts on our behalf.
  * In the event Buyouts Insider goes through a Buyouts transaction, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users’ PII will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.


  6. **Email Policy**



Buyouts Insider is committed to complying with all U.S. privacy laws, such as the CAN-SPAM Act, and all other applicable privacy laws, such as Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, and it is our intention that our email communications be pursuant to such laws.

With the exceptions noted above, Buyouts Insider does not allow any third-party company to use your email address for commercial purposes without your expressed permission. We will send you newsletter communications, partner sponsorship messages, account alerts, and any other emails you have requested to receive.
