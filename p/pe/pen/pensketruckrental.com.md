Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. and its subsidiaries (“Penske”) are sensitive to privacy on the Internet. Use of any information gathered from or about you through the Sites shall be governed by the Sites' Terms of Use (http://www.pensketruckrental.com) and this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy in full to learn how we treat personal information obtained while visiting our Sites, and we encourage you to check back regularly for any updates. Use of the Sites indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Sites' Terms of Use, and Penske's use of your information as described below. 

### Collection of personal information

We collect personal information in various ways to better serve you. Such information may be used to allow you to order or schedule services, receive support for the services we provide, to allow us to contact you to provide those services, to complete delivery of products and services, and to protect Penske from fraudulent transactions. We also use the information we collect to tailor and improve your experience while using the Sites. 

Once you access the Sites, we may collect personally identifiable information through your use of the Sites. Such personally identifiable information may include e-mail addresses, domain names, addresses and routing information; your name and phone number; your mailing and/or billing addresses; and other relevant data that will better allow us to provide information and/or services related to your needs. 

Social Security Numbers: we strive to protect the confidentiality and security of Social Security numbers (“SSNs”) in our possession, custody or control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to: (i) restrict employee access to and use of SSNs; (ii) prevent unauthorized third party access to the SSNs, and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs. 

### Collection of aggregate information

In addition to the personally identifiable information described above, we also collect Aggregate Information from many users about use of the Sites, such as number of visits and pages visited on the Sites, and the overall duration of time spent on the Sites. The information we collect depends in large part upon the needs of your account and what services and features you use on the Sites. We do not disclose this information to third parties. 

### Cookie technology

When you enter information or otherwise navigate through the Sites, the Sites use temporary “cookies” during the request process. A “cookie” is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser for storage by your hard drive that allows us to provide you with tailored information and services by recognizing your hard drive when you return to the Sites. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Currently, we use cookies to keep track of selections you make for information from our Sites. If you choose to do so, you may opt out of the use of cookies through your browser's options. Refusing “cookies,” though, may make certain features of the Sites unavailable to you. 

### Right to monitor use

Penske reserves the right, without any obligation, to monitor your use of the Sites for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Sites' Terms of Use. Penske further reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or content which it deems in its discretion to be harmful, abusive, offensive or hateful to Penske, its affiliates, or to any of Penske's customers and/or users of the Sites, or that may violate the law. 

### How we disclose personal information

We do not sell information to unaffiliated third parties that identifies you personally or makes it possible for unaffiliated third parties to contact you directly without your consent. 

We may distribute the personally identifiable information that you submit to us, both internally within our company and to our agents and affiliates as necessary for purposes related to our products and services. While we endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of all material submitted that is identified as confidential by the submitter, we cannot accept, and hereby expressly disclaim, any liability from losses relating to the unauthorized disclosure or interception via the Internet of any information that you submit. 

Penske also may provide personally identifiable information to certain third parties that have entered into contracts with us to provide certain services. We may also use this information to help us manage programs and services that may be of interest to you. 

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may disclose information about you, in our sole discretion, if we believe that disclosure is necessary (a) to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request or to respond to a subpoena; (b) to operate this website; (c) to protect the safety, rights or property of Penske or users of this Site or any of Penske's websites; and (d) or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy. 

In the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business and assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with that transaction. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains protected. 

### How we protect personal information

Penske takes physical, electronic and managerial precautions in our efforts to prevent unauthorized access and use of any data you send us. We recommend that when you access the Site, you do so from a secure browser. We also recommend that when passwords are requested/required to be used to access the Site be a unique combination of letters and numbers in order to protect your information. 

### Third Parties

We cannot be responsible for maintaining your privacy once you leave our Sites. When you click on any links or banners on our Site that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement of any and every site you visit, whether you are linking from one of our Sites or browsing on your own.
