For each visitor to our website, we may collect information concerning the usage of our website by that visitor, including the visitor’s Internet domain and/or IP address, information concerning the visitor’s browser, and other access-related information. We also may assemble aggregate information (i.e., information obtained by compiling information from many different visitors) as to usage of our Web site. This information is used to analyze our website's utility and to enhance the areas and functionality within our site that appear to be of interest to various users.

Also, we may use "cookies" or similar tools, which are typically small pieces of information that are delivered by our web servers and stored by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. The information stored and transmitted by these tools may be used to facilitate the functionality of our website, to learn about your preferences and internet session information, to provide a more relevant online experience, to study the efficacy of marketing campaigns, and for other legitimate website operation and marketing purposes. For more information about the use of cookies and other similar technology, please visit a not-for-profit information site such as: http://www.networkadvertising.org.

We receive and collect personally identifiable information – such as name, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and/or postal addresses – from visitors to our website when they (i) submit inquiries or requests to us, (ii) become registered users of our websites, (iii) sign up to receive newsletters or bulletins from us, (iv) respond to (or post) Shopper advertisements, (v) participate in our research activities, (vi) purchase or download our research products, or (vii) choose to provide information to us for some other reason. Any personally identifiable information you provide will be used by us or our service providers in connection with providing services to you and in order to process any requests or inquiries that you initiate. While you can choose not to provide your personal information, that decision may limit our ability to contact you and our ability to provide services or products to you. Also, please note that if you have provided us with a postal address, an e-mail address, or a telephone number, a Harte-Hanks representative may contact you unless you have requested that we put you on one of our do-not-contact lists.

We may obtain personally identifiable and other information about you from our parent, sister, and subsidiary companies and/or business partners and add it to information that you have previously provided to us in order to serve you better. From time to time, we may compare our contact lists to lists received from our parent, sister, and subsidiary companies or third party service providers to try to avoid sending you unwanted, unnecessary or duplicative messages. We may also utilize and incorporate information from other sources to update and supplement information concerning you. All such combined, updated, and supplemented information will be handled consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Please note that some Harte-Hanks websites may use ad serving companies to place banner ads from other firms on our sites. As with similar online advertising techniques, your interaction with these advertisements may generate information associated with you, your computer, or the information related to the content present you were viewing. For more information about these marketing techniques and technologies, please visit a not-for-profit information site such as http://www.networkadvertising.org Please note that while portions of the investor relations section of our website are managed by our vendors, neither Harte-Hanks nor these vendors, when acting on our behalf, collect or receive personally identifiable information within the investor relations section of our website, other than for the purposes of satisfying or responding to information requests.

If you place an ad using our Shoppers services you will be asked to provide contact information to be placed in the ad such that respondents can contact you regarding your ad. If you respond to a Shoppers service ad through our website, you will also be asked to provide contact information. In either instance, Harte-Hanks may share the contact information you provide us with third parties. If you do not want us to provide your contact information to third parties do not use the Shoppers service.

Some Harte-Hanks websites conduct business research activities and/or sell research products. Harte-Hanks wants you, and your company, to welcome our attempts to contact you regarding your business and your participation in our business research efforts is completely voluntary. You have a choice to request that you not be contacted for these activities, that we reschedule our research activities or contact you in a different manner. If you choose to participate in our business research activities or purchase our research products, Harte-Hanks may offer third parties the opportunity to purchase your information obtained via our business research efforts or share your personal information with our research sponsors. If you do not want us to provide your information to third parties do not participate in our research activities or receive our research products.

In general, the information provided by website visitors at our site will not be sold, transferred, or traded to any third parties for the marketing of third parties’ goods or services without a visitor’s consent. Some Harte-Hanks websites give you the opportunity to “opt-in” for data sharing with third parties and other Harte-Hanks websites give you the opportunity to “opt out” for sharing data with third parties. We will only share your data consistent with your “opt-in” or “opt out” preferences (and, if you “opt-in”, you can subsequently “opt-out” using the contact methods set forth below).

However, as noted above, information we collect regarding you or your company in connection with your use of our Shoppers service and our research activities, may be shared with other parties so that they may contact you regarding products or services that they think may be of interest to you. If you do not want your information shared do not use the Shoppers service or participate in our business research.

As our privacy policy provides you with information on how you may “opt- in” or “opt-out” from our information sharing activities and direct marketing services, we do not maintain or disclose a list of parties which may have received your personal information. If you wish to request additional information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, contact us using one of contact methods listed below.

In order to operate our website and provide services to you, we may provide personally identifiable, aggregate, and other information associated with our website to third parties that provide services for us, including services such as shipping, payment processing, database management, and Internet services. We endeavor to require such third-party service providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with this Privacy Policy. On occasion, we may also share personally identifiable and other information concerning you with our affiliates (such as a parent or sister company, or a subsidiary of our company) in furtherance of our operations (and those of our affiliates) as well as any requests that you may make (such as responding to advertisements or do-not-contact requests).

In the event of a merger or acquisition of our company, the sale of substantially all of its assets related to the operation of our website, or other change of corporate control or in any line of business sale, all information concerning website visitors and registered website users may be transferred to or controlled by the surviving or successor entity. In such a case, such information would remain subject to our Privacy Policy as in effect from time to time.

We also will transfer personal and non-personal information when we believe the transfer is necessary to comply with the law, to protect or enforce our rights and our safety, or to protect the rights and safety of anyone else. In addition, we may provide personally identifiable information to credit bureaus or collection agencies if we are permitted or required to do so by law.

Harte-Hanks has training and other policies and procedures in place that are intended to cover and address the logical and physical security of our workplaces and the integrity and protection of electronic records stored in our systems and on our premises.

Unfortunately, no data security methodology is 100% safe, and we cannot guarantee information security. It is also important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your information. Be sure to take simple steps, such as signing off and logging out after each use of a shared computer, keeping your passwords in a secure location, and not sharing your passwords with any third parties.
