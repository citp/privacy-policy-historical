### Penn Medicine Online Privacy Principles

  1. Penn Medicine will not send you email newsletters or other electronic communications about services, programs or website features unless you ask to receive them.
  2. Penn Medicine will tell you if the information you provide is being submitted through a secure or unsecured transfer.
  3. Sending email directly to an email address found on a Penn Medicine website is not secure. Penn does not recommend using unsecure email to communicate sensitive personal health information to anyone.
  4. Penn Medicine provides links to other websites that may have privacy statements that are different from Penn Medicine's.
  5. This website is intended for use by people age 13 or older.



**1\. Penn Medicine will not send you email newsletters or other electronic communications about services, programs or website features unless you ask to receive them.**  
You can choose whether or not to receive email communications from Penn Medicine. We will not send you email unless you've requested it. On every email message we send, we include instructions on how to unsubscribe from our email list. Please use our [Contact Us](https://www.pennmedicine.org/submit-question/) form if you'd like to be removed from an email list.

**2\. Penn Medicine will tell you if any information you provide is being submitted through secure or unsecured transfer.**  
To help you use or learn more about Penn Medicine's services and programs, various contact forms have been posted throughout Penn Medicine's websites. To use these forms to contact Penn or ask Penn to contact you, you will need to complete the fields of information requested. The information you provide is transferred electronically to the person or people who can assist you with your request.

If Penn Medicine offers secure technology, such as encryption, for you to transfer requested information to Penn Medicine, it will say so on the page.

If Penn Medicine does not offer encryption or a secure transmission for a particular request form, it will say so. Be aware that unsecured information transferred over the Internet is similar to a postcard being sent through the mail. It is recommended that you do not send sensitive personal health information to Penn Medicine or anyone else using unsecured means. Should you choose to supply confidential information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.

Information received through a contact form is only shared with people who can assist in answering your questions or resolving your concerns.

**3\. Sending email directly to an email address found on a Penn Medicine website is not secure.**  
Again, unsecured information transferred over the Internet is similar to a postcard being sent through the mail. It is recommended that you do not send sensitive personal health information to Penn Medicine or anyone else using unsecured means. Should you choose to supply confidential information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.

**4\. Penn Medicine provides links to other websites that may have privacy statements that are different from Penn Medicine's.**  
Penn Medicine's websites contain links to third party websites that are not affiliated with Penn Medicine. Penn Medicine is not responsible for the content or privacy statements of those websites. If you are asked to supply personal information to those websites, we suggest you read carefully through the privacy statements of those websites.

**5\. This website is intended for use by people age 13 or older.**  
If you are younger than 13, you should get permission from your parents or guardians to use this website. And, if you are under 13, you should not submit information to this website. Instead, ask your parent or guardian to submit information on your behalf.
