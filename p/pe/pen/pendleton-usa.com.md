#### This Policy was last updated on: March 18, 2019  
Your privacy and security are important to us, and we appreciate the trust you place in us when you shop with us. This Privacy & Security Policy (“Policy”) describes how we handle your information. By using our website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, so please review this page and the Policy regularly.

**Information We Collect**  
We collect the following categories of information about you: Postal Address If you purchase from us or request a Pendleton catalog by mail, we will need a postal address, and we will add your name to our mailing list. Occasionally, we may also share your name with select companies whose services or products may interest you. If you do not want to receive our catalog by mail or do not want your name shared with other companies, just let us know by calling 800-649-1512 or email us at 

[_pendletoncatalog@penwool.com_](mailto:pendletoncatalog@penwool.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy). You may also write to us at Pendleton Woolen Mills Customer Service, PO Box 3030, Portland, OR 97208.

Phone Number  
We ask for your phone number in case we need to contact you regarding your order. We will not otherwise call you, and we will not share your phone number with any other companies.

All payment information is encrypted and securely transmitted to our payment processor. Payment information is never stored within any Pendleton system.

Cookies  
Pendleton may also use “cookies” or other means to passively collect information about your use of our website. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer that lets your web browser talk with Pendleton's web server. For example, cookies save you from retyping your user name and password every time you use our secure checkout. If you are shopping on the Pendleton site and are having difficulty completing your order, please check the privacy settings in your browser. If you have your settings set to not accept cookies, you will not be able to purchase from the Pendleton site. Pendleton may also use “cookies” provided by an agent, third party agency, or other provider or other means to passively collect information about your use of our website. 

**Do Not Track**  
Pendleton honors the do-not-track settings of their customers.

How We Share Information:  
We use your information to provide you with the best possible service experience related to your order, including order fulfillment. Your information may also be used for data analytics, research, and marketing.

**Third Party Vendors**  
We may also from time to time contract with third-party vendors to serve ads to our customers on our behalf across the Internet or to send mailings to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. To do this, the vendors will collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our products and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie or pixel tag—industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. Our vendors may also pool the anonymous information that they collect with other sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving a catalog. If you do not wish for cookies or pixel tags to be placed on your computer, most commercially available web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place.

**Children**  
The Pendleton website is intended only for those aged 18 and older. If you are under 18, you may not register or submit personally identifiable information on, to or through the site. Pendleton does not collect personally identifiable information from any person Pendleton knows to be under 18.

**Security**  
If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please call and place your order by phone at 800-649-1512. To protect the security of your information during all communications with our website, we use HTTPS (secure/encrypted HTTP using Transport Layer Security (TLS)) protocols and software, which encrypts information you input and that we return to you. The presence of a “closed lock” icon in your browser indicates encryption is being used on the webpage you are viewing. In addition, an internet address that begins with “https://...” indicates the page you are viewing uses encryption. The “s” stands for “secured.”
