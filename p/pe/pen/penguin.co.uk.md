# Penguin UK - Privacy Policy

This web site is owned and operated by Penguin Books Limited.

If you have any questions about this web site or our privacy policy, please contact us by writing to Online Marketing, Penguin Group (UK), 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL or telephoning 020 7010 3000.

We want people who visit our web site to be able to take part fully in the activities and offers we provide. We also want to make sure that when we collect information from you we do so in a way that does not infringe your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy is designed to give you useful information about your rights and the way we collect and use personal information.

We do not ask you to disclose any more information than is reasonably necessary to enable you to participate in an activity on our web site and to improve the web site.

We do not generally disclose personal information we have collected from you through this web site to third parties. We may do so sometimes, in which case we will say so when the information is collected and you will be able to inform us that you do not want us to do this. This will not stop you enjoying the site, you can simply tell us that you are happy for us to have the information so you can take part in the activities we offer, but that you do not want us to pass that information on.

Besides what we describe in this Privacy Policy, we do not maintain any personal information obtained from users through this web site in a retrievable form. 

When you want to participate in activities on our web site, this is the sort of information we ask for and how we use it:

  * When you enter competitions, we ask you for your name and email. If you win, we ask you for your residential address. This is so that we can let you know if you have won anything, send you your prize and let other people (such as other users of our web site, the public and our own employees) know about our competitions and their winners.
  * When you send e-postcards, we will ask you for your name and email address so we can let whoever receives the postcard know who sent it and so we can make sure you get a copy (by email) too.
  * If you register to be sent information about our authors, books and so forth either on the Hear From Us page or in any of the following areas of the web site: the Press Office, Author's Lounge, Academics pages or Booksellers pages, we will ask you for your name, contact and demographic details. We use this information to identify you, to contact you about your interest in Penguin, including sending out information you have requested, and for internal market research purposes.



We only keep the personal information you submit for these purposes until we have made use of it in these ways. 

We use cookies on this web site. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. They enable us to recognize your web browser. In effect, cookies tell us when you have visited our site and where you have been, but they do not identify you personally - just the presence of your browser. We use cookies to see how often people visit our site and what they look at. This helps us to know what parts of the site are popular - what people are interested in - so we can make sure we have more interesting material on the site in future. If you don't want us to be able to do this, your browser's help section should be able to tell you how you can disable or filter cookies and how to arrange for your browser to tell you when you've been sent a new cookie.
