This website ("website") is operated by the business identified under the copyright notice at the bottom of the home page of this website ("Company") whose general contact details are on the website and specific contact information as it relates to this Privacy Statement is set forth in the section below entitled "Feedback".

The terms "Company", "we", "us", "our" and "ours" when used in this Privacy Statement mean the Company, and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches, or affiliates.

The terms "you", "your" and "yours" when used in this Privacy Statement mean any user of this website. IMPORTANT NOTICE: BY USING OUR WEBSITE YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA (AS HEREAFTER DEFINED) THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED BELOW.

Scope of Privacy Statement

We are committed to the privacy and confidentiality of information provided by you to us. This Privacy Statement describes our current policies and practices with regard to Personal Data collected by us from you directly and/or through the website to the extent that such Personal Data is protected by applicable United States and European data protection laws. The term "Personal Data" refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, job description, health or financial related data, birthday, e-mail address or mailing address.

Notification of changes to Privacy Statement

We are continually improving our methods of communication and adding new functionality and features to this website and to our existing services. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law and the changing nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change, we will notify you and the local data authority where required by law of the changes through information posted at the website on this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to check this Privacy Statement frequently.

Collection of Personal Data including e-mail addresses

You may choose to buy products from us or receive additional information or services from us. When you purchase our products or request additional information, we request personal information about you such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number and payment details. We may also ask for demographic information to enable us to provide a personalized service to you. The information you provide is either manually or electronically stored in our databases. We may process or store your Personal Data in our databases located in any country in which we do business. We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate postal or zip codes are received, we may use third party software to fix them.

Use of Personal Data

We will use your Personal Data to fulfill your requests and we will ask only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. We may store information collected through the above-mentioned means to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your Personal Data and your purchasing history to information in the profile. When we send you information for any purpose, it may be sent by e-mail or mail. _We_ _may use your personal data to process your  application when you apply for a career with us._

When we ask you for Personal Data it may include the following purposes:

·         We may contact you occasionally to inform you of new products and services we will be providing; 

·         We may send you regular updates on issues we think will be of interest to you; 

·         We may send you requested information on our products and services; 

·         We may use your Personal Data for marketing purposes and market research; and 

·         We may use your Personal Data internally to administer this website and help us improve our services.

We hope you will be delighted with our products and services. However, if you do not wish to receive e-mails from us and want to be removed from our electronic mailing list, please e-mail us at the e-mail address given in the section below entitled "Feedback" with "Email Unsubscribe" in the subject heading.

If you also wish to be removed from our regular mail marketing database, please let us know by e-mailing us at the e-mail address given in the section below entitled "Feedback" with "Regular Mail Unsubscribe" in the subject heading or writing to us at the address given below.

Anonymous data collected through this website

In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, our web server automatically logs which pages of our website our visitors view, their IP addresses and which web browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website.

Our website contains hyperlinks to other pages on our website. We may use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages on our website our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally - it simply enables us to compile statistics about the use of these hyperlinks.

Cookies

The use of "cookies" is a common practice. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. For example, if you allow a website to remember your login name or password, the website places a cookie on your computer. We may use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary session ID cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you do not have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance your experience on the Website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. If you block cookies, you may not be able to use certain features or functions of our website, or the website may not operate in an optimal mode.

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.

We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.

Disclosure of your Personal Data

We do not share, sell license, trade, rent or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third parties, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Statement and under these limited circumstances:

·         In order to provide you with the information or products which you have requested, Personal Data may occasionally be transferred or shared with other companies within our group of companies or third party intermediaries who act for us for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to support our information technology or to handle mailings on our behalf. As such, we may share information with third party intermediaries (e.g., United Parcel Service, Federal Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express) for shipping and billing purposes only. Only the information necessary to provide these services will be shared with the third party intermediaries; these companies do not retain personal information or share it with other parties. The third party intermediaries are further prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We are the sole owner of the information collection on the website. 

·         We will keep your contact details on our database and may, from time to time, e-mail or mail you information to make you aware of our other similar products and services which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mails or mail from us for these purposes, please let us know by following the "unsubscribe" procedure set out above. 

·         Where you have consented, we may also share your Personal Data with other companies within our group of companies or disclose your Personal Data to other businesses who may contact you about their products or services that may interest you. 

·         We may share, transfer or disclose the information in our databases and server logs to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, interacting with anti-fraud databases, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this website, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of our sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. We will inform you of any such transfer or disclosure as required by law. 

Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data and to comply with applicable law.

Data access and corrections

Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your Personal Data, we will disclose to you the Personal Data we hold about you, for which we may make a charge up to the maximum as allowed by applicable law. We will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Data that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. To change or remove any Personal Data, please contact us using the contact information given below under the section entitled "Feedback". Please be aware, however, even if we update your Personal Data, or we remove such information, it may still be stored in other databases (including those kept for archival purposes) and may be used to compile aggregated or demographic information for third parties in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

Requests to delete Personal Data are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on us.

Links to other websites

This website may contain hyperlinks to websites that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party websites or any association with their operators. We do not control these websites and are not responsible for their data or privacy practices. We urge you to review any privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any Personal Data about yourself.

Transfer of data abroad

If you are visiting this website from a country other than the country in which our servers are located (currently the USA), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.

By visiting this website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Statement, including its transfer across international boundaries and to subjecting yourself to applicable law in those countries in which the servers used for the transfer of such information are located.

Surveys or Contests

From time to time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys from our website. If you elect to participate, we will request certain Personal Data from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and you, therefore, have a choice whether or not to disclose the information requested.

Personal Data collected may be used to notify contest winners, award prizes, monitor website traffic, to personalize the website, and in any manner described in the Use of Personal Data section.

Newsletters and Service-Related Announcements

If you wish to subscribe to a newsletter to the extent one is provided, please contact us using the contact information provided in the section below entitled "Feedback".

We will also send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an e-mail. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

Privacy Protections for Children

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Our website is not designed to attract or interact with children 13 years and under. We do not collect information from those we actually know are under 13.

Security

The security of your Personal Data, which includes information about you and your company, is important to us. We want your information to remain secure and strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. Specifically, we have implemented a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure. For example, the servers are located in controlled, secured environments and protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Employee access is restricted to those employees that we consider need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or to do their jobs. All our employees must abide by this Privacy Statement and are subject to disciplinary action if a violation of the Privacy Statement occurs.

Notwithstanding the above commitments and measures taken to secure your information, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that third parties may find a way to thwart the security systems and protective mechanisms that we have enacted to protect your information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we continually strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us. Transmission of information to us is at your own risk.

If you have any questions about the security of our Website, please contact us using the contact information identified in the section below entitled "Feedback".

Transfer of Information Upon Sale of the Company or an Affiliated Entity

The Company may assign, sell, license or transfer any information you provide, including Personal Data, to a third party directly involved in an assignment, sale, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of some or all of the assets of the Company or one or more of its affiliated entities.
