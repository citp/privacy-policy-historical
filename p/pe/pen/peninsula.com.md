## 2\. How we use Personal Data

2.1 We may use your Personal Data in the following ways.

 Please note that use of Personal Data under EU data protection laws must be justified under one of a number of legal “grounds” and we are required to set out the grounds in respect of each use in this Privacy Policy. An explanation of the scope of the grounds available can be found below.

In respect of hotel-related services, such pre-arrival message will include other information about the hotel, the area and the weather.

This also applies when we have reason to believe that disclosing the Personal Data is necessary to obtain legal advice, to identify, investigate, protect, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our guests, visitors, associates, rights or properties, or to others, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

We will ensure that no more of your Personal Data is transferred than is necessary.

**Use Justification** : contract performance, legitimate interests (to allow us to run and manage our business).

3.2 This Privacy Policy does not apply to our processing of personal information on behalf of, or at the direction of, third party providers (for example, airlines, car rental companies, table booking websites) who may collect personal information from you and provide it to us. In this situation, we would merely act as a data processor and thus advise you to review applicable the third party provider’s privacy policy before submitting your personal information.

## 4\. How we transmit, protect and store Personal Data

**Security of communications**  

4.1 It is important to note that no security system or system of transmitting information over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. There is a risk inherent in the submission of information online, use of e-mail and facsimile. Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending forms to us online or by e-mail or facsimile, for example, from the “Contact Us” section. We recommend that you do not include any sensitive information including credit card details when submitting information online, using e-mail, facsimile or when using any public computers/public WIFI.

**Security controls**

4.2 We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal data we maintain against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  Despite such efforts, however, please note that no company can fully eliminate risks or guarantee the security of personal information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of information about you at any time, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal information or other data arising in connection with theft of the information or other malicious actions

4.3 We store certain customer information and reservation details in our Customer Information System and Reservation System on our subcontractor’s secure servers. Our server resides behind firewalls to protect Personal Data collected from you against unauthorised or accidental access. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.

**Personal  Data transmission across international borders **

4.4 As a global company, we endeavour to provide you with the same outstanding service in Hong Kong, as you would find in New York or Tokyo. To achieve this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties, offices, global customer service centers, data centers, trusted service providers, and trained associates around the globe. The nature of our business and our operations require us to transfer your Personal Data to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own* for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, the HSH Group will take appropriate measures, including contractual clauses, to secure the transfer of your Personal Data to recipients (which may be internal or external to the HSH group) located in a country with a level of protection different from the one existing in the country in which your Personal Data is collected.  
_*Currently, guest data may be transferred to our headquarters in Hong Kong as well as other countries where we are present, including China, Japan, Vietnam, United Kingdom, United States of America, Thailand, the Philippines and France. We also use third party service providers which are located in countries such as United States of America and Australia to process mailing, certain online bookings and purchases of gift cards._

4.5 Your Personal Data may be accessed by staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the European Economic Area (EEA) including to countries which may have a lower level of data protection than under EU data protection law. We must comply with specific rules when we transfer Personal Data from inside the EEA to outside the EEA. When we do this, we will use appropriate safeguards to protect any Personal Data being transferred.  Where required, we will transfer your Personal Data subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose different data protection obligations directly on the recipient. Please contact us as set out in Section 6 below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards we apply to the export of your Personal Data.

4.6 Your Personal Data will be stored for the period of time required or permitted by law in the jurisdiction of the operation holding the information (for example certain transaction details and correspondence may be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the transaction has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data). So if information is used for two purposes we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires; but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period once that period expires.

4.7 Our retention periods are based on business needs and your Personal Data that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymised (and the anonymised information may be retained) or securely destroyed.

## 5\. Your rights
