**How Secure is the Data?**

To maintain the accuracy of the Data, as well as preventing from unauthorized access and ensuring the correct use of the Data, we have carried out appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure the Data we collect online.

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet, to protect the Data. When you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.

The website has a firewall in place, which should protect the Data collected from you against unauthorized or accidental access. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet, and privacy cannot be assured in your communications to us. You acknowledge that personal information is disclosed at your own risk, and may be subject to unauthorized use by others. This may result in you receiving unsolicited messages from other parties. We are not responsible in any manner for direct, indirect, special or consequential damages, howsoever caused arising out of the communication of information to us.

**What About Cookies and Log Files?**

A cookie is a piece of information about the user that a website can send to your web browser, which may then store it on your computer system. With the use of cookies, we can better serve you when you return to our site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future.

We may collect information regarding your IP address, browser type, domain name and access time. This information is used for our own research and analysis purposes and is separate from the Data. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information. In rare instances, IP addresses may be used to assist in deterring and/or preventing abusive or criminal activity on the website.

**Data Transfers Across International Borders**

As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same outstanding service in Hong Kong, as you would find in New York or Beijing. To achieve this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties, offices, data centers, trusted marketing partners, service providers, customer contact centers, and trained associates around the globe. The nature of our business and our operations required us to transfer your information, including personally identifiable information (PII), to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own. Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, The Peninsula Hotels will take appropriate steps to ensure that your PII is protected and handled as described in this privacy statement.
