### Cookies 

Pennyauctionscanada.COM, the "Web Site", uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your billing information every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate and enhance your Web Site experience.

We may also link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Policy. 

### Links to Other Web Sites 

Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another Web Site or internet resource.

However, in the normal course of business we may share some of your personal information within our corporate family and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by law. Some of these operations may result in personal information collected by Penny Auctions Canada being stored or processed outside of Canada and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these foreign jurisdictions.

### Disclosure to Service Providers 

Penny Auctions Canada may use third parties to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share personal information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: fulfilling online orders, processing non-cash payments, sending marketing communications, servicing products, conducting research surveys, verifying and validating information that you have provided to us, delivering products, and providing customer support services. Penny Auctions Canada has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our Web Site.

If you do not wish us to provide your personal information to those service providers, we may be unable to process your transaction.

### Legal Disclosure 

Penny Auctions Canada may disclose your information as permitted or required to by law; for example:

  * to a government institution or other person or entity that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information; 
  * where we have reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity; 
  * to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or entity with jurisdiction to compel the production of information;

### How does Penny Auctions Canada Protect My Information? 

The security of your personal information is a high priority for Penny Auctions Canada. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. Although we cannot take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; we employ technological tools like firewalls and passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of personal information.

### Choosing a Password

When you create an online account on our Web Site, you need to select a personal password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose at least 6 characters including a combination of both letters and numbers.

To learn more about Phishing and email fraud, please read below: 

#### Learn about E-mail Fraud

Phishing (also referred to as brand spoofing) is a type of scheme that uses fraudulent e-mail and web pages to gather personal, financial and sensitive information for the purpose of identity theft. Most commonly, users receive spam e-mail (mass e-mail messaging) and pop-up windows that appear to come from legitimate businesses. People have been tricked by these deceptive solicitations into sharing passwords and credit card, social security and bank account numbers. As an online user, you should always continue to take precautions including querying the origination of e-mails, the URLs that those e-mails purport to take you to, and paying close attention to the secure padlock icon on your Internet Browser. Additionally, you should always navigate the web using authentic Internet security software. The ONLY time Penny Auctions Canada collects your credit card information is when you are making an online purchase on our secure web site. If you think you were the recipient of a phishing e-mail where you provided some information, please contact your credit card company immediately to determine what recourse you have available to you. Penny Auctions Canada is committed to protecting and ensuring your personal information remains private. If you have any questions for Penny Auctions Canada, please contact us at [privacy@pennyauctionscanada.com](mailto:privacy@pennyauctionscanada.com).

Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, and provided we can authenticate your identity, you will be given reasonable access to your personal information, and will be entitled to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and to have it amended as appropriate. You may also ask us to change your preferences regarding how we use or disclose your information, or let us know that you do not wish to receive any further communication from us.

### When is Your Information Removed?

We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and to meet any legal requirements. We have retention standards that meet these parameters. We destroy your information when it is no longer needed, or we remove your personally identifiable information to render it anonymous.
