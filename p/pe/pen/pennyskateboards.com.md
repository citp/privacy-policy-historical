We recognize the utmost importance of the need to protect the personal information of children. For this reason, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years old. Features on our sites which may collect personal information are age-gated so they are not available to children under 13 years old. If we do collect personal information from a child under 13 years old, we may maintain that information only as long as it is reasonably necessary as required by law, or to fulfill a request with parental consent. If we discover we possess information from a child under 13 in a manner inconsistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act's requirements, or other relevant laws, we will seek to delete the information immediately.

We are committed to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information. We have physical, administrative, electronic, and technical security measures which are designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized viewing, access, disclosure, use, and modification. We periodically review all security procedures to consider appropriate new measures which become available to us.

Despite all efforts, however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill any requests, and will strive to dispose of all personal information in a secure manner when the information is no longer reasonably necessary.

* ### Data Transfers, Storage and Processing Globally.

We operate globally and may transfer your personal information among Absolute, its parent company, or third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Wherever and whenever your personal information is transferred, stored, or processed by us, we will strive to safeguard the privacy of your personal information.

* ### Changes to this Privacy Policy.

We may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, adjust to new industry practices, or to abide by regulatory requirements. Changes are generally intended to provide greater protections of your personal information, or for other purposes. When we materially change this privacy policy, we will provide notice to you, where required by applicable law. Your continued use of the product or service, including use of any company website, after the effective date of the change will constitute acceptance of the change. We may provide such notice by email, by posting the notice on our sites, or by other means consistent with applicable law.

California Civil Code section 1798.83 allows you to request information regarding any disclosure of your personal information by Absolute to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
