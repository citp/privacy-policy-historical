Be aware, however, that third parties, including its partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through its Site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit the Egghead Site you may link to, or view as part of a frame of content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.

If you select the "remember me" option when logging in for instance, the Egghead Site will set a cookie so that you do not have to login again the next time you visit PennyStockEgghead.com. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this Site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p> </section> <section><h4>Newsletters:</h4><p>If you wish to subscribe to the PennyStockEgghead.com newsletter(s), Egghead will use your email address to send the newsletter to you.</p> </section> <section><h4>Choice/Opt-Out:</h4><p>Egghead will provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving its newsletter, in which case your email address is permanently removed from its database.
