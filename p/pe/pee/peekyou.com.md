#### 2\. Information Collection.

##### A. Information You Provide.

We collect information about you when you use the Service or interact with us offline, including information you provide when you search for people, usernames or phone numbers on [www.peekyou.com](https://web.archive.org/), access our content, submit a request, or contact our customer support. The categories of information we collect and have collected in the last 12 months, include:

  * **Contact Data** , including your name, email address, postal address, and phone number.
  * **Demographic Data** , including your age, gender, and country.
  * **Search Data** , including the people, usernames or phone numbers you search and the results of those searches.
  * **Content** , including the content within messages you send to us such as questions to our customer support.



You may choose to voluntarily provide other information to us that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information. 

##### B. Information Collected Automatically.

In addition, we automatically collect information when you use the Service. The categories of information we automatically collect, including in the last 12 months, includes:

  * **Service Use Data** , including data about the features you use, the pages you visit, the searches you make and view, the links you click, the time of day you browse, and your referring and exiting pages.
  * **Device Connectivity and Configuration Data** , including data about the type of device or browser you use, device operating software, internet service provider, device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as IP address and Ad Id.
  * **Location Data** , including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level) and, with your consent, precise location data (such as latitude/longitude data).



We use various current – and later – developed tracking technologies to automatically collect information when you use the Service, including the following:

  * **Log Files** , which are files that record events that occur in connection with your use of the Service.
  * **Cookies** , which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, supporting security features, and allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.
  * **Pixels** (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us to track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account. 



For further information on how we use tracking technologies for analytics and advertising, and your rights and choices regarding them, see the “Analytics and Advertising” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections below.

We share information we collect in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The categories of entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes, including in the last 12 months, includes: 

  * **Service Providers**. We share information with entities that process the information on our behalf. Service providers assist us with services such as data analytics, marketing and advertising, website hosting, and technical support. We contractually prohibit our service providers from retaining, using, or disclosing information about you for any purpose other than performing the services for us, although we may permit them to use information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated or de-identified) for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law.

#### 5\. Social Media and Technology Integrations.

We offer parts of our Service through websites, platforms, and services operated or controlled by separate entities. In addition, we integrate technologies operated or controlled by separate entities into parts of our Service. Some examples include:

  * **Links**. Our Service includes links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. PeekYou indexes websites available on the public Internet. The search results displayed on PeekYou’s Service may contain links to unaffiliated websites not controlled or operated by us. 
  * **Brand Pages**. We may offer our content through social media. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Service on social media (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with PeekYou in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.



Please note that when you interact with other entities, including when you click on a search result link, you are leaving our Service and entering a website belonging to a separate entity. The unaffiliated entities controlling those websites may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by those entities remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and platforms, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

#### 6\. Analytics and Advertising.

We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads for our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services. 

As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“ **Interest-based Advertising** ”).

For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the Service and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, please see the “Information Collected Automatically” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections.

#### 7\. Your Rights and Choices.

##### A. Removing Search Results About You.

PeekYou is a search engine that indexes information from unaffiliated websites on the public Internet. You may remove information from www.peekyou.com by filling out the web form available at <https://www.peekyou.com/about/contact/optout/index.php>. Removing information from our Service does not constitute removal from the Internet. As such, you understand that your information may resurface on www.peekyou.com if you do not take additional steps to limit your privacy settings or remove your information on unaffiliated websites that are the original sources of information. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity prior to removal. Please note that we will retain and use information about you as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Californians have additional rights as set out in the “Additional Disclosures for California Residents” section below.

##### B. Tracking Technology Choices.

  * **Cookies and Pixels**. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
  * **Do Not Track**. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. There is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/). 



Please be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly. 

##### C. Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.

Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at [google.com/settings/ads.com](https://google.com/settings/ads.com). 

Companies and vendors that provide targeted ads to you are required to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ **DAA** ”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“ **NAI** ”). To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, <https://www.aboutads.info/choices>; and (ii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, <https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).

Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any PeekYou statements regarding their opt out options or programs. 

##### D. E-mail Communications.

You can opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us at any time by following the instructions as provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or emailing us at the email address set out in the “Contact Us” section below with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field of the email. Please note that you cannot opt out of non-promotional emails, such as those about transactions, servicing, or PeekYou’s ongoing business relations. Please note that your opt out is limited to the email address, device, and phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. 

#### 8\. Children.

The Service is intended for a general audience, and is not directed at children under (13) years of age. 

We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or “COPPA”) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section below. We will remove the data to the extent required by applicable laws.

If you are a California resident under 18 years old and you have registered with a Service, you can ask us to remove content or information you have posted to a Service. Email us at the email address provided in the “Contact Us” section with “California Under 18 Content Removal Request” in the subject line, and tell us what you want removed. 

#### 9\. Data Security.

We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.

#### 10\. International Transfer.

We are based in the U.S. and U.S. law governs the information we collect. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of information about you in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as set out in this Privacy Policy.

#### 11\. Changes to this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy.

#### 13\. Additional Disclosures for Nevada Residents. 

Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section below.

#### 14\. Additional Disclosures for California Residents.

These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California.
