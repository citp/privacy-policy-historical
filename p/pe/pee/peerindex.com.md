# » Privacy Policy PeerIndex

Our service allows users to measure their social influence on the web. Providing this service requires us to collect information about your interests and preferences, while shielding personal information from risks of misuse. Our privacy policy is reviewed at regular intervals to ensure it meets the current statutory requirements and covers all PeerIndex websites (including www.peerindex.com, www.peerperks.com, groups.peerindex.com, labs.peerindex.com) as well as the software and services made available through the PeerIndex API. By using PeerIndex services you are agreeing to this privacy policy.

Our cookie policy is detailed [here.](http://about.peerindex.com/cookies/)

## Principles

Our privacy policy is driven by these privacy principles:

  * Users are in control of their personally identifiable information and its association to other data,
  * Respecting this control, we want users to gain the greatest benefit from their data
  * Our focus is on data, derived information and community metrics that in themselves are not personally identifiable information
  * We won’t provide partners with personally identifiable unless a user has previously agreed to it through terms and conditions of the service or is required for fulfilment of the services offered by PeerIndex and its partners that the user has signed up to (e.g. by participating in a PeerPerk)



For the purpose of this policy personally identifiable information is:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Telephone



## Policy

**We collect the following data from public sources, 3rd parties and directly:**

  * Personal information provided by you while using PeerIndex services which includes include name, email address, photo and postal address
  * Publicly accessible information from 3rd parties such as Twitter and Facebook
  * Private information from 3rd parties such as Twitter and Facebook with your permission
  * Analytic and login cookies as well as server log files
  * Data for 3rd party metric services



**We use the information collected to provide and enhance the services offered by PeerIndex, for the following:**

  1. Calculation of metrics for individual users for example PeerIndex and Topical PeerIndex 
  2. Calculation of metrics for communities of users for example average PeerIndex of a group 
  3. Production of a public profile for users that is available on the PeerIndex web apps and via the PeerIndex APIs 
  4. Production of reports for partners and clients that do not include personally identifiable information (save as described in point 9) 
  5. Fulfilment of PeerIndex services such as PeerPerks 
  6. Enhancement and improvement of the PeerIndex web apps and services in order to provide a better user experience 
  7. Monitoring and reporting for internal business purposes 
  8. Let users know about offers, promotions, new products and updates to PeerIndex services based on their preferences

**We will NOT:**

  9. We will NOT share personally identifiable information with 3rd parties that is not already publicly available except: 
    * where you have given us permission to (e.g. by participating in a PeerPerk),
    * the 3rd party already has that information, or
    * as required by law.



**Users are in control of their data. We provide the control in the following ways:**

  1. Users can update their privacy settings on 3rd party services (e.g. Twitter and Facebook) to reduce publicly available information
  2. Users can select what personally identifiable information is shown on the public profile (e.g. connect Twitter and Facebook but only show Twitter on the public profile) via the privacy settings on PeerIndex
  3. Users can set their public profile to private to avoid sharing the information with other users via the privacy settings on PeerIndex
  4. Users can delete their profile via the privacy settings page on PeerIndex



While we respect users control users participation publicly on the web puts users activity into the public domain and forms part of the data we collect on other users. We endeavour to avoid displaying that information tied to personally identifiable information.

**We take the security of data seriously. We practice a risk management strategy and follow industry standard practices including:**

  1. Our servers are firewalled and require encrypted logins to access
  2. Servers and software is regularly updated to latest versions to fix security vulnerabilities
  3. High risk vulnerabilities are patched as soon as identified and the patch is available
  4. Any passwords we collect are stored encrypted



However, no security measure is completely effective and PeerIndex cannot guarantee the complete security of users personally identifiable information.

## Change of Ownership or other Business Transaction

In the event PeerIndex enters into a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or the sale of all or part of its assets (a “Business Transition”), users data (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information associated with the PeerIndex services) will likely be part of the assets transferred.

In this event, we will notify you of any Business Transition. We will also notify you of any subsequent material changes to this Privacy Policy as a result of a Business Transaction and give you the opportunity to opt-out for information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a new Privacy Policy containing material changes takes effect.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

PeerIndex reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time consistent with applicable privacy laws. When we do change it, we will make a copy of the updated Privacy Policy available to you before it takes effect. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will also notify you by e-mail. In the event of material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out for information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a new Privacy Policy containing material changes takes effect.

You understand and agree that if you use the PeerIndex services after the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy, PeerIndex will consider your use as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
