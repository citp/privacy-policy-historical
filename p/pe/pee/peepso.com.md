We may share general information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with PeepSo under confidentiality agreements. General information may be used to help PeepSo communicate offers to you from PeepSo and our marketing partners. Our partners do not have any independent right to share this general information and any offers will include a URL and email address that you can use to unsubscribe from future mailings.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
