# Privacy Policy of Pure Energy Systems

We take your privacy seriously. PES Network, Inc. (PES) has created this policy in order to demonstrate our concern and commitment to your privacy. PES does not sell any private information it collects.

### PES GATHERING AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

**COOKIES**

At this time, PES collects no user-specific data on visitors to our site. We do not use cookies. However, we do anticipate a change in this policy to enhance the user experience. Such changes will be posted in this privacy statement when they are made.

**Registration for PESWiki**

We request that you use your real name on your profile page, and we recommend that you also include your email.  You can cloak your email from spambots by formatting it something like this: <emailname {at} domain.com>.  Presently we are manually setting up user accounts, due to previously problems with spam submissions.  In applying for a user account, you will be given an option as to what additional information you wish to include in your profile page.  Information you wish to be kept private will be kept private.  We request this information so that we can contact you in the case of any issues that may arise with content you post/modify at PESWiki.

**Registration for Email Lists**

PES presently uses Yahoo Groups for specific project e-mail lists.  Yahoo Groups requires users to provide contact and other information.  PES does not have access to the private portions of this information, such as address and password.  That is administered by Yahoo Groups.

PES sets up and moderates password protected lists using Yahoo Groups at this time. However, in some rare cases, protected lists may become public. Participants will be informed when the list is to be made public and have the option to request that Pure Energy Systems remove any information they do not want made public.

**PUBLIC Lists**

PES sets up and moderates public lists using Yahoo Groups. Information disclosed on public lists is considered public information and may appear on the website as well as in the list archives. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.

**Changes to this Policy**

This Privacy Policy may change over time. Data collected can and will be used in accordance with the posted Privacy Policy at the time of collection. Changes to this policy are not retroactive. Pure Energy Systems reserves the right to modify the policy at any time. Please check this page periodically to see if any changes have been made.
