# Privacy Policy - PESI

### PESI PRIVACY POLICY 

#### Privacy Policy

PESI, LLC has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. We highly value the trust and confidence our customers have developed in PESI throughout the past twenty-five years of business. In short, we would do nothing to jeopardize these relationships. To illustrate our intent, the following discloses our information collection, utilization, and protection practices for this website: [http://www.pesi.com/](https://web.archive.org/).

#### Information Collection

Beyond what information visitors to our Web site freely and knowingly provide through customer-initiated contact, our server automatically logs IP addresses along with their corresponding arrival times, departure times, files accessed, browsers used, and operating systems used.  Our utilization of this information is detailed below. 

#### Information Utilization

In an effort to administer our Web site, your IP address and corresponding information will be temporarily stored in a log that allows us to monitor the amount of traffic on our server as well as the accessibility of our web site to our customers.  In return, we hope to be able to avoid any potential download and transmission problems you may experience.

Our e-commerce software requires visitors to accept a cookie when browsing or shopping.  The cookie is merely used to facilitate your navigation through our site as you select items and place them in your shopping cart.  This cookie is not used for any reason after the session in which it was issued.  Rather, a new cookie is issued upon subsequent visits. 

Although you may request to be added to our house file at any time, placement of an order or registration will add you and your contact information automatically.  We will use this information to make any necessary clarifications to your order/registration, to confirm receipt of payment, and to inform you of any significant changes in product ship date, seminar outline or seminar location that may affect you.  You may also receive further communication regarding comparable products and upcoming seminars.  Inquiries and other direct contact that does not pertain to a request to be added to our house file or placement of an order/registration will not result in the capture and storage of your contact information.

Although we do not sell e-mail addresses, we may, upon occasion, sell the names, physical addresses, and possibly phone numbers from our house file to an agency of an appropriate and related purpose.  By supplying your contact information and allowing yourself to be added to our house list, it is assumed that you agree to this practice unless you specifically indicate otherwise.  

If at anytime you wish to update your contact information or be removed entirely from our house file, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) and specify the appropriate changes.  If you would like to remain on our house list but would like to discontinue a specific form of communication (i.e. fax or e-mail), please contact us and let us know what type of communication you would no longer like to receive.

#### Information Protection

All orders and registrations placed are sent through 128-bit SSL encryption.  Rest assured that the data you transmit in the course of placing an order or registration -- including, but not limited to your credit card number -- will not be intercepted by a third party. 

#### Changes

In the future, all customers will be notified via email if any changes are made to this policy. 

#### Questions?

If you have any questions about this policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/).
