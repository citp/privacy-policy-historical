# Privacy Policy

We're serious about the privacy and security of the information you entrust us with. This privacy statement explains how we use any personally identifiable information collected from you if you shop at our online store. If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, you should contact Customer Care at 888-PEP-BOYS.

Information Collection and Use: We are the sole owner of the information collected at our online store. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information from our users at several different locations in our online store.

 **Registration:** In order to get the most out of our online store, users are encouraged to first complete a registration form. During registration a guest is required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to create a personal account for the guest and to contact the user about Pep Boys' products and services. It is useful also as they can receive updates via e-mail regarding the status of their orders as they flow through the delivery process.

 **Order:** We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. The contact information may also be used to contact the user about Pep Boys' products and services.

 **Cookies:** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log-in with a password more than once per visit, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. For registered users, we are using encrypted cookies that will expire after 3 months. If a site guest rejects the cookies, when they traverse our site and click into an area that requires a log-in, we request they enter their password. If a guest elects to reject the use of cookies, they will have to complete a full log-in here. The only drawback to this is that the user rejecting cookies will be limited in their access to some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience each time they visit our online store.

 **Log Files:** We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the online store, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **Sharing:** We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We also partner with other third parties to provide specific services. The user is not required to sign up for these services, but if they do, we may share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

We do not authorize these third parties or the shipping company to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services and ship orders. However, we have no control over the disclosure and use policies and practices of any of these third parties.

 **Links:** Our online store contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected at our online store.

 **Surveys and Contests:** From time-to-time our online store requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with our online store and for contacting users about Pep Boys' products and services.

E-mail a Friend: If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our online store, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site.

 **Security:** Your online store takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing." To [learn more about SSL, follow this link](http://www.ssl.com/).

If you have any questions about the security at our online store, you can contact us at 888-PEP-BOYS.

 **Supplementation of Information:** In order for us to properly fulfill our obligations to our online customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. This information is limited to information about products to be presented as part of our electronic catalog and other information that allows us to sell and ship products to consumers. Guest profiles or other sensitive user information is not shared as part of this interaction.

Special Offers: Upon registration, our system sends all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information about Pep Boys' products and services.

 **Site and Service Updates:** We also send the user service announcement updates about our online store. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.

 **Correction/Updating Personal Information:** If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done on the Update Profile page accessed via the account page or by calling our Customer Care team at 888-PEP-BOYS.

 **Notification of Changes:** Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
