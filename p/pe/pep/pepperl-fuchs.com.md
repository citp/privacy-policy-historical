# Data protection information regarding use of the Pepperl+Fuchs website

For the purpose of pursuing our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our website in line with article 6, paragraph 1, clause F of the GDPR), we use a number of different **methods** to analyze your usage patterns. All methods have in common that data will only be collected, processed, and used in an **anonymous or pseudonymous** manner. While anonymous data is impossible to match with a specific person, pseudonymous data could theoretically be matched to you personally with some effort. Regardless of this, no procedure will assign any data to a specific person or combine that data with other data held by Pepperl+Fuchs without your explicit consent. More detailed information on **the analytical services we employ** and your options for revoking consent for them can be found below:

**Google Analytics**

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies," text files that are stored on your computer and enable your use of the website to be analyzed. The information generated by the cookie relating to your use of this website is generally sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Google is certified under the **Privacy Shield framework** and thus guarantees that European data protection laws will be upheld [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).

Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate use of this website by visitors, to compile reports on **website activity** , and to provide us with other services in connection with website and Internet usage.

We only use **Google Analytics** with **IP-anonymization active** , meaning that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google within the Member States of the European Union and other Contracting States that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

The IP address transferred from your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data by Google. You may decline cookies by changing a corresponding setting in your browser software. However, we would like to make clear that this may prevent you from using all functions of this website to their fullest extent. You may also prevent Google from using the cookie to collect and process data (incl. your IP address) relating to your use of the website. To do so, click on the following link ([http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)) to download and install the **browser plugin** , or click on the following link to set an **opt-out cookie** : Deactivate tracking by Google Analytics.
