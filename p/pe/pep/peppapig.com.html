We are committed to protecting your privacy. &nbsp;This privacy policy explains our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifying information of yours and/or personally identifying information of your children (collectively, “your PII”) that you may provide to us through the Peppa Pig&nbsp;Site and/or Peppa Pig mobile applications (collectively, “Peppa Pig Online Service”). &nbsp;It also provides you with details about your rights to control your PII.&nbsp;<br><br>Our legal status is that of a "data controller" and in this capacity we will securely store and process your/your children’s personal information which you/your children have provided to us. &nbsp;Data controller is a legal term used in EU legislation to signify the person who controls what to do with any given personal information. &nbsp;We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office (registration number Z9919769).&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is eOne?</h2><p>eOne is a company registered in England and Wales (registration number 02989602), whose registered office is at 45 Warren Street, London, W1T 6AG.<br><br>We respect your right to privacy and will only process PII that you provide to us in accordance with the applicable privacy laws, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). &nbsp;To learn more about COPPA, you may consult this simple one-page information guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where is PII collected on the Peppa Pig Online Service?</h2><p>The Peppa Pig Online Service may contain websites and mobile apps directed to children, including young children between the ages of 2 and 5. &nbsp;It contains a children’s section (the “Children’s Area”) and a parents’ section (the “Grown-Up Area”). &nbsp;In the Children’s Area, children mainly participate only by playing games, reading e-books and watching videos. We generally do not offer any place in the Children’s Area where a child can sign up or enter PII. Typically, the only part of the Peppa PIg Online Service where anyone can enter information is the Grown-Up Area.&nbsp;<br><br>Accordingly, in most cases, we do not anticipate that we will be collecting PII directly from any children. &nbsp;We anticipate and assume that we will be collecting PII only from parents. If we do learn that a child under the age of 18 has provided PII on the Peppa Pig&nbsp;Online Service, we will not process any PII of that child without the prior consent of that child’s parent or guardian in accordance with COPPA.</p><h2>What PII do we collect on the PJ Masks Online Service?</h2><p>Actively, meaning, you knowingly provide it to us:<br><br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;When you sign up for the Peppa Pig Online Service from the Grown-Up Area, we may ask you for your first and last name, e-mail address, and country, and for your child’s first name, birthday, and gender. &nbsp;<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;When you sign up your child for a competition on the <span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig</span>&nbsp;Online Service, we may ask you to provide your child’s first name, birthday and gender, and whatever other information that particular competition requests.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you make a purchase or sign up for a subscription on the<span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig&nbsp;</span> Online Service, which may require that you provide certain credit card or financial information to us or the payment provider processing the transaction on our behalf.&nbsp;<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Passively, through cookies and other tracking technology (see our Cookies policy below).<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If you access the <span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig</span>&nbsp;Online Service through a computer or mobile device, we may be able to identify the country in which you are located.

We ensure that our organisation treats information lawfully and correctly. To this end we fully endorse and adhere to UK data protection legislation and in particular to the principles set out in the General Data Protection Regulation. In particular, without your consent or first amending this Privacy Policy to reflect any change in our usage of personal information:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;we will not use your/your children’s information for any purpose that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy;<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;we will only collect sufficient information for the uses set out above;<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;we will endeavour to keep your/your children’s information up-to-date;<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;we will not retain your/your children’s information longer than necessary unless required to do so by law;<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;we will operate appropriate technical and organisational processes to protect your/your children’s information against unauthorised or unlawful access or processing and against accidental loss or destruction. The detailed measures we take are described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy; and<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;we will not transfer your/your children’s information to any country unless safeguards are in place to protect your/your children’s information to the standards that apply within the EU.</p><h2>How do we use cookies?</h2><p>A cookie is a small data file that a website transfers to a user's hard drive when a user visits the website. &nbsp;A cookie file can contain information such as a unique ID that the site uses to track the pages visited, and is a standard method of saving website user preferences. &nbsp;These preferences are stored in a file on your computer's hard disk drive. &nbsp;<br><br>We use “analytical” cookies to recognize and count the number of visitors to the <span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig</span>&nbsp;Online Service and to see how visitors move around the <span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig</span>&nbsp;Online Service when they’re using it. &nbsp;This helps us improve the way the <span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig</span>&nbsp;Online Service works, for example, by making sure users find what they need easily.<br><br>The <span style="color: rgb(0, 98, 153); font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Peppa Pig&nbsp;</span>Online Service may also use local shared objects, also known as flash cookies.
