# About Pella Windows and Doors – Privacy Policy | Pella

_Pella Insynctive Products_  
_Connecting Pella Products with Third Party Products:_ If you are using certain Pella products, such as those featuring Pella’s Insynctive technology, these products can communicate directly or indirectly through third party devices and software (“Affiliate Devices”). Our technology acts as a bridge between our products and Affiliate Devices. Through our Insynctive products, Affiliate Devices may collect certain personal and non-personal information, including, product usage data, and general location based information. These third parties may share information they collect about you with us but we are not responsible for their data collection practices. We urge you to review their privacy policies to better understand their processing of your data. Data collected through our App by third parties help us and our partners better understand how our consumers are using our products and how to improve our products.

**Interest Based Advertising**

We may ourselves, or with third party vendors, use non-personal information in connection with our own or vendor information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit other websites or our Site. Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies described above may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called “behavioral advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any personal information. As a result, we and our vendor know your interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under “Your Choices.”

**Your Choices**

We will include an “opt out” link in each electronic newsletter or promotional email we send you, so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future. You may also contact us at privacy@pella.com.

To be clear, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device.
