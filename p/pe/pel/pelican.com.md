Cookies. When you visit our Site we send one or more "cookies" to your computer or other device. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, tracking user trends and providing relevant advertising to you. 

HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION  
To Provide Products, Services, and Information. As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide you with information and support that you request from us. We use your personal information to contact you about your requests. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders, and to fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us.

We may use third parties to help host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service. We use demographic information to better understand our customers, and improve our products and services.

Your Consent. In addition to sharing for reasons as described elsewhere in this Policy, we will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of the Pelican when we have your consent to do so. 

Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm. We will share personal information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of Pelican if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:   
Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request.   
Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations.   
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.   
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Pelican, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.

Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently. 

ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION AND CHOICES  
If you have questions about personal information we have about you or need to update your information, you can [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20130410083335id_/http%3A//support/contact.php) or call us at (800) 473-5422. You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from Pelican by sending us an email saying "Please remove," or using the opt-out or unsubscribe feature contained in the e-mails. 

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION  
In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on our Site is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as a social security number) is protected by encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and our Site. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails and other communications you send to us through our Site are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. 

INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY PRACTICES   
Pelican's websites, including websites directed to residents in countries and jurisdictions outside of the United States, are operated and managed on servers located and operated within the United States. By using and accessing our Sites, residents and citizens of countries and jurisdictions outside of the United States agree and consent to the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located in the United States, and that the protection of such information may be different than required under the laws of your residence or location.

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY  
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent in accordance with applicable law. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
