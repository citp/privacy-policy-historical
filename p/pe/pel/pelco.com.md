#### Pelco Privacy Policy

Updated: July 1, 2004

Pelco is committed to protecting your privacy. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement does not apply to Pelco products or services. Please read the complete Pelco.com privacy statement.

Personal information collected by Pelco often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed. For example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.

**Use of your Personal Information**  
We use your personal information for the following purposes:  
• To deliver services, such as newsletters or events.  
• To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Pelco, if you so request.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Pelco may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Pelco or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Pelco and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Pelco employees, users of Pelco products or services, or members of the public.

When you give us personal information, Pelco will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.

**Use of Cookies**  
When someone visits the site, a cookie may be placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. One use of cookies is to assist in the collection of the site visitation statistics described above.

**Enforcement of this Privacy Statement**  
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact Pelco by e-mail. Pelco will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. For material changes to this statement, Pelco will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site.
