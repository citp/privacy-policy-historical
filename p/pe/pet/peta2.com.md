# peta2 Privacy Policy | About peta2 | peta2.com

We at peta2 strongly believe in protecting the privacy of any personal information gathered from our Street Teamers and visitors to peta2.com. Since the protection of your privacy is important to us, we have created this privacy policy to let you know our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that can be linked to an individual, such as a name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other information provided to us by our members and Web site visitors.

**_Note:_  If you’re under 18, please make sure that your parent or guardian has read and agreed to these terms before you use this site. ‘Cause we don’t want to get yelled at. That would suck.**

  * Sending personalized e-mail messages when participating in action alerts
  * Registering for peta2′s Street Team

We use your information to send you details about our campaigns, events, activities, Street Team missions, and alerts.

We also use the information gathered via our Web site to improve your peta2 Web experience. We perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas on our Web sites and to use such information to improve our Web sites’ ability to serve you better.

**Does peta2 use cookies on its Web sites?**

peta2 uses “cookies” (the Web kind, not the delicious kind) on some Web pages. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a visitor’s hard drive but that does not itself contain any personal information. Cookies enhance a visitor’s experience by saving the visitor from having to log in or provide information each time he or she revisits peta2.com and by customizing content based on a visitor’s interests. Visitors can configure their browsers to be alerted when a site is attempting to send a cookie and refuse the cookie.

We also use cookies to administer the Web site, track visitor movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**How is information used in peta2   _E-News_?**

If you provide peta2 with your e-mail address, you will be signed up to start receiving the bi-weekly peta2 E-News, and you may receive other e-mails regarding PETA events, campaigns and other news. You can unsubscribe from any or all PETA e-mail lists at any time by following the instructions included in each e-mail, or by e-mailing [peta2@peta2.com](mailto:peta2@peta2.com). The information that we gather from subscribers to our e-news lists (including e-mail addresses) is not shared with other non-PETA-affiliated organizations or companies. From time to time, we may send out e-mail messages that include information about these like-minded organizations and companies, but we do not provide them with access to any personal information that you have provided. If you live outside the United States and provide us with your contact information, we may share it with PETA’s international affiliates in order to keep you aware of developments in animal protection activities in your part of the world. If you don’t want your information to be given to PETA’s international affiliates, please e-mail [peta2@peta2.com](mailto:peta2@peta2.com).

In order to provide you with better and more relevant information, we compile information about e-mail response and Web site usage. This information helps us better understand site usage patterns as well as what types of content and information may help improve your user experience on peta2′s Web site.

All e-mail messages sent to e-mail newsletter subscribers contain a link to unsubscribe or modify your profile. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to any e-news or e-mail communication from peta2 at any time.

If you have any questions about peta2 e-news, please e-mail [peta2@peta2.com](mailto:peta2@peta2.com).
