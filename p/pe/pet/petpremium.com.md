3\. With whom the information may be shared;  
4\. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; and

### **1\. What information do we collect?  **

**We collect several different types of information from you:**

##### **A. Information collected at registration**

We collect personal information when you register with us and when you use our Services. We may combine this information about you with information we obtain from our business partners or other companies. During registration for some of our services, we may require users to give us basic contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail addresses, and mobile phone number). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked “required” is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. If you are between the ages of 16-18 you must have your parent’s approval to register. If we learn that a user is under the age of eighteen without valid parental approval, we will terminate the account and delete the user’s information. We will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this policy.

##### **B. Information collected through use of the Site and Services**

In addition to the specific questions you answer when you register for our Services, we may also collect information from winners of our contests, such as their street address, phone number, and date of birth so that we can comply with various state and federal reporting requirements.

We collect system information such as IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes.

We also may use cookies, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our Services and Site to your preferences. For example, we may use this cookie to identify you as a registered user of our Services. If you do not allow your browser to accept cookies, please understand that some of the areas or functionality within our Site may be limited.

The use of cookies by our partners is covered by our privacy policy. We do not have always access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc. 

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

Provider allows the user the possibility to interrupt the flow of information received per email. Information received and available can be interrupted by sending an email to [ **info@petpremium.com**](mailto:info@petpremium.com) or call our 1-800-491-7025.

  * We may disclose the name of winners of our contests as may be required by law on our Site and in winner’s lists.

  * We may also disclose information about you as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with laws such as to comply with a subpoena, regulations, court or administrative orders, or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to yourself or others.

  * We may disclose your personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business that this privacy policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization.

We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing personal information to third parties.

### **7\. Security**

Your privacy is important to us and we take reasonable measures to protect the security of the personal information we collect. Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use standard security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

When you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

The Provider makes no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy, currency, completeness, or adequacy of the contents of this Web site and expressly disclaims liability for errors and omissions in its contents. No warranty of any kind, implied, express or statutory, including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and freedom from computer virus, is given with respect to this Web site, the Services or its links to other Internet resources.

### **9\. Endorsement Disclaimer**

When visiting our Web sites, your Web browser may produce pop-up advertisements. These advertisements were most likely produced by other Web sites you visited or by third-party software installed on your computer. The Provider does not endorse or recommend products or services which you may view when you receive a pop-up advertisement on your computer screen while visiting our site.

If we make any change in how we use your personal information we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
