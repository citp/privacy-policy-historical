# Privacy Policy | Pets4Homes

Please note that the privacy of our visitors at 'Pets4Homes' is very important to us.

At 'Pets4Homes', we recognise that the privacy of your personal information is very important. Here is some information on the types of personal information we or third-parties may receive and collect when you use and visit our site, and how we safeguard your information. Please note that we never sell your personal information to third parties.

## Log Files

As with most websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or BT Internet), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), the time you visited and spent on our site and which pages you visited on our site.

## Contacting Advertisers

When using our website to contact and respond to advertisers using our contact forms, your contact details entered including your ip address are stored on our systems and passed on directly to the advertiser so that they can respond directly to your enquiry rather than through our servers. This is so we can monitor suspicious activities and contact you if necessary.

## Registering on Pets4Homes

When registering on our website to place an advertisement, we store the contact details you enter including your IP address and ISP on our systems. As well as using this information on your account and display of your adverts, we use it to monitor suspicious activities and contact you if necessary. We do not pass any of your details on to other companies for marketing purposes. We may however pass your details on to authorities including the police, trading standards and local councils if they provide us with an official request for information to help them in their investigations.

## Cookies Usage

The Pets4Homes website using cookies for various reasons as follows :

  * The Pets4Homes website stores cookies on your computer which is used during the registration process and to make sure you stay logged in to your account, along with storing preferences related to using our website.
  * We also use third party advertisements to support our site from both Adsense and Criteo. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information about your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (i.e. showing Manchester adverts to someone who live in Manchester) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
