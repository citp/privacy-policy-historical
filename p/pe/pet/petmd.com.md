This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications or online platforms and any other online products and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

### Social Sharing Features and Surveys

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take or articles you enjoy on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.

You may also be asked to participate in surveys about your experience(s) with the Services. These surveys may be conducted by our third-party partners. The collection, use and storage of any data associated with surveys conducted by such third parties is governed by such partner’s privacy policy.

### Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and in applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the PetMD web properties and Services and those of our affiliates, and other websites and applications. The information these entities may collect includes your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and information about actions you took when you saw or clicked on an ad. This information may be used by PetMD, our affiliates, and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services, our affiliates’ services, and other websites and services and better understand your online activity. Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Neither PetMD nor its third party providers have a systematic method for ensuring that browser “Do Not Track” requests are consistently honored. However, you may learn more about online advertising and opt out of the use of your web browsing activity to serve targeted ads by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also disable cookies in your browser, as described below.

We may also work with other websites or platforms (such as Facebook) to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign, unless you notify us that you prefer not to have information about you used in this way. To opt out, [click here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

If you are under 13, do not provide any information through the Services, make any purchases through the Services, or use any of the interactive or public comment features of the Services.
