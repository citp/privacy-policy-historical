##  Data Usage

RSC’s primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience and to assist with purchasing, ordering, and support.  This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs and to improve your experience.

RSC only processes personal data that a user voluntarily consents to provide to RSC. This information may include your name, date of birth, gender, address, IP addresses, product details, equipment or device, GPS coordinates or location data, additional usage and device data may be collected through the use of "Smart Products” and "Mobile Apps".

We may require you to create an “Account” or "Smart Product Account" prior to using services, purchasing items through the website, registering your product, registering or accessing warranty information, registering for any contest, or other content submission.

We ask that you provide us with certain information during the registration process. While you are not required to do so, if you are unable or unwilling to do so, you will not be able to complete the registration process, and therefore you will not be able to access and use certain information, material and services.

Additionally, we will use personal data and communication preferences to determine the best method to communicate with you in regard to your account or services.

Personal data may be used in investigations related to violations of policy, terms and service agreements, acceptable usage, and unauthorized or attempted unauthorized access.

##  Children's Privacy

We take children's privacy seriously. This Website is not directed to children. We do not seek to collect personal information about children through our Website. We ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. If we learn that someone under the age of 18 has submitted information to us through any part of our Website, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that can be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and removed the information, we will honor that request.

##  Acquisitions and Other Reorganizations

Information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Protected Personal Information, may be disclosed to one or more third parties in connection with any change of ownership or control in RSC’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), and any such information may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Equally, information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Information, may be disclosed to one or more third parties in connection with any acquisition or merger carried out by RSC of such third parties.

In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the terms in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. In the unlikely event that RSC or substantially all its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
