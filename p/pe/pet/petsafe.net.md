##  Privacy Policy

_This document was last updated February 23, 2009._

Thank you for visiting www.petsafe.net ("Website" or "Site").  The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of information Radio Systems Corporation ("Radio Systems," "we," "us" or "our") gathers about you when you visit this Website, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.  By your use of this Website, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229192410id_/http%3A//www.petsafe.net/Customer-Care/Policies/Terms-of-Use).  By your use of this Site following posted changes to either the Privacy Policy or [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229192410id_/http%3A//www.petsafe.net/Customer-Care/Policies/Terms-of-Use), you signify your assent to those changes.  Other Radio Systems' websites may operate under their own and different Privacy Policies and we encourage you to review them.

**1.          Children's Privacy:** We take children's privacy seriously.  This Website is not directed to children.  We do not seek to collect personal information about children through our Website.  We ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us.  If we learn that someone under the age of 18 has submitted information to us through any part of our Website, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.  Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that can be reviewed or deleted.  If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and removed the information, we will of course honor that request.

**2.          Personal Information We Collect:** Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using our Website.  This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs and to customize our services to make your experience easier and quicker.

You can browse part of this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  However, we will gather and store certain information from your visit automatically including:

·         **Your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address.**

·         **The domain from which you access the internet.**

·         **The kind of browser or computer you use.**

·         **The address of the internet site, banner or email from which you selected or entered a link that brought you to this Website.**

·         **The number of links you click within this Website.**

·         **The state or country from which you accessed this Website.**

·         **The date and time of your visit and how long you spent visiting the Website.**

·         **The pages you viewed on the Website.**

·         **Your computer’s operating system.**

We require you to create an account prior to purchasing items through the Website register your product for warranty purposes, to register for any contest or other content submission.  We ask that you provide us with certain information during the registration process. If you cannot do so, you will not be able to complete the registration process, and therefore you will not be able to access and use certain information, material and services.

**3.          How We Use the Information:** We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for information, our products, programs and services, to respond to your inquiries, to communicate with you, and to offer you other products, advertisements, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design content of the Website.  We may also use this information in the aggregate to analyze website usage, as well as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229192410id_/http%3A//www.petsafe.net/Customer-Care/Policies/Terms-of-Use). 

To accomplish the above, we may share your information with third parties including third party affiliates, our sales representatives and business partners.  We may also reveal customer data to these third parties to invoice for goods or services purchased through this Website or to ship orders.  These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose.  We do not sell information about you to third parties.

**4.          Use of Cookies:** A cookie is a small data file which we use to collect information about how our Website is used.  A cookie file can contain information such as a session ID that the website uses to track the pages you visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.  A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your e-mail address.  We only use cookies to gather information indicated in this Privacy Policy and do not use cookies to gather personal identifying information about you without your consent.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence.  You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to access or use this entire Website.

**5.          Legal Requests:**  Radio Systems cooperates with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights.  In response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or other alleged improper or illegal activity, we may disclose information relevant to the investigation including, but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, IP address, user history and complaints.

Without limiting the above, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other third parties, except as specifically outlined in this Privacy Policy, without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of this information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.  In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merge with another company.

**6.          Security:** Perfect security does not exist on the internet and we cannot guarantee anyone complete security.  Although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private and would never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.  You understand that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collected from this Website.

**7.          How You Can Access or Correct Information:** In order to ensure the accuracy of the personal information you have provided when creating an account with us or registering a product, you may change such information at any time by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229192410id_/http%3A//www.petsafe.net/Register-Product).  To the extent this information is stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such correction or deletion will reach the other databases, but we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or is correct in our records.

**8.     **     **Links:** This Website may contain links to other sites.  Please be aware that Radio Systems is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on this Website.
