At Intelligent Content Corp., the creators of PetPlace.com, we are committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our site and the security of the information they provide to us. 

The only “personal information” (i.e. information that identifies an individual, such as a user’s full name or email address) that Intelligent Content Corp. will collect, through its PetPlace.com site, about our users is information that is voluntarily submitted by a user. 

Intelligent Content Corp. shall not disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent. **NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECEDING STATEMENT, INTELLIGENT CONTENT CORPORATION MAY, AT ITS OPTION, SHARE YOUR FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, AND E-MAIL ADDRESS WITH OUR PARTNERS AND SPONSORS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO SUCH USE IS SIGNIFIED BY YOUR USE OF OUR WEB SITE OR BY YOUR CLICKING ON “I Agree” BELOW.**

In connection with these offerings, Intelligent Content Corp. may request that you provide personal and other information. We will identify what personal information is required to provide you with the service or promotion and how that information will be used. By participating in such offerings, you consent to the identified uses of your personal and other information. Such information will not otherwise be disclosed without your consent. 

Intelligent Content Corp. may provide non-personal statistical information and data related to our users and their pets (for example, statistics related to product purchases by species or breed categories) to our partners, sponsors, suppliers, vendors and other third party affiliates. 

PetPlace.com is a password protected site, and we have taken great care to protect against the loss and misuse of information within our control. We employ a secure database and send personal information only via an encrypted transmission channel. 

PetPlace.com may contain various links to third party Web sites. Although these links provide greater services and resources to visitors to our site and they may even contain PetPlace.com trademarks and branding, we exert no authority over these linked sites. When you access a link from the PetPlace.com site to a third party site, you exit PetPlace.com and enter a third party’s site. Intelligent Content Corp. has no control over the privacy standards of such third party sites and assumes no responsibility or liability for the privacy and data collection policies or actions of any linked sites. Intelligent Content Corp. recommends you review the policies of third-party sites before providing personal information to any third party sites.

Such information is used in the aggregate to help us understand how visitors make use of our site and the services and other resources we provide. While most browsers are set to receive cookies, you can alter your browser setting to refuse cookies or provide an alert when cookies are being sent. 

**PetPlace.com employs an “opt-out” methodology.** When you register on PetPlace.com you implicitly “opt-in” to receiving e-mail, marketing and/or promotional materials from our site or from our partners. This methodology provides that users will have the opportunity to receive at least one (1) e-mail, marketing, and/or other promotional piece from our site or from our partners. Upon receipt of any e-mail, marketing, or other promotional material, you will have the ability to “unsubscribe” or to “opt-out” of receiving future electronic notifications.

If you are under the age of 13, you can access the offerings on PetPlace.com requiring input of information only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.**

Any individual information voluntarily supplied by you that we have within our database will be available to you upon written request and proof of identification to Intelligent Content Corp., 20283 State Road 7, Suite 400, Boca Raton, Florida 33498. Intelligent Content Corp. will correct any errors in your personal information upon your request.
