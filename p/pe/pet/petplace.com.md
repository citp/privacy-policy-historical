## The Information We Collect and Its Use

At Embrace Pet Insurance, we gather information about you to process and service your insurance policy, settle your claims, offer you additional products and services that we think may be of interest to you, and as directed by you with your consent. Some of the areas on the site where we collect this information is when you subscribe to our newsletter, contact us, apply to the partner program, purchase pet insurance, or give us feedback. Some of this may be nonpublic, personal information (information not available to the general public) that is provided by you, that we gather from transactions and communications with you, through services performed for you, that we obtain from third parties, or that we obtain through other means.

If you use our blog which is hosted by Typepad on this web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you chose to submit in the blog.

## Service Providers

We use third parties to provide our credit card processing services and an e-mail service provider to handle our email services. We will share your billing information and email address as necessary for these third parties to provide their service.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.

## Information We Disclose

Information about our customers, former customers, and consumers who do not purchase products from us will be disclosed only as permitted or required by law, or as directed by the customer or consumer.

We may disclose information to affiliated and nonaffiliated insurance companies, insurance agents, reinsurance companies, consumer reporting agencies, government entities, and claims administrators. We may also disclose information to non-affiliated third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf including the marketing of our products or services. However, as previously disclosed, these non-affiliated third parties may not use your personally identifiable information for their own marketing purposes.

The following are examples of situations in which we may disclose information:

## You Don't Need to Opt-Out

Some companies allow access to your nonpublic, personal information by nonaffiliated third parties so they can market their products and services to you. Several laws give you the option of "opting-out" of this type of information sharing. However, at Embrace Pet Insurance we do not share your information with nonaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes, unless you specifically direct us to do so. Therefore you don't need to "opt-out."
