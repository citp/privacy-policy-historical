**Privacy Policy**

**PETsMART Values Your Trust.**  
We value your trust -- So we have taken great care to inform you in this Policy what we do and do not do with information that you provide us in the course of using our website, purchasing our products or using our services. 

**Your Privacy is Important.**  
We use our best efforts to maintain the personal information you give to us in a secure, safe and responsible manner within the PETsMART Family. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the personal information we collect will not be sold, rented or leased and will only be shared within the PETsMART Family, which consists of divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates of PETsMART, Inc. (such as PETsMART of Canada, State Line Tack stores and/or catalog, PETsMART.com, PETsMART pet catalogs and PETsHOTEL), as well as PETsMART Charities, and those service providers that are in PETsMART stores, such as the veterinary (Banfield, The Pet Hospital) and grooming services, and adoption agencies. We may combine the information you provide us from these different sources. 

**Customer Value and Satisfaction.**  
The PETsMART Family seeks to be the most trusted, caring, complete, exciting and value oriented source for all your pet’s needs throughout its life – a Total Lifetime of Care. To accomplish this, we offer wonderful products and services and occasionally team up with our suppliers to provide other offers of value to you. 

**Your Choice.**  
It is up to you whether you provide us with your personal information by participating in any of the activities mentioned in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to participate, your personal information will be carefully handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**Personal Information.**  
When you purchase our products and/or services in our stores, through our catalogs, over the phone and on-line, as well as when you participate in our surveys, occasional sweepstakes or promotions and/or PetPerks program, you provide us with information. Depending upon what information you provide to us and whether, and where, you purchase products and/or services, the information we receive may include your name, mailing, billing and/or shipping address, telephone number, driver’s license number, birth date, form of payment, e-mail address, pet information, product and service preferences, what you purchased and where (i.e., store location, catalog and/or website). If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, the information we receive will include your account number and your form of payment. The PETsMART Family uses the information you provide to service your account, to ship an order to you, to provide warranty service on products and/or services you purchased, and to personalize your experience with the PETsMART Family to provide a Total Lifetime of Care for your pet(s). 

**Security of Your Transactions.**  
The PETsMART Family has policies and procedures in place to ensure that information you share with us is handled in a safe, secure and responsible manner. We use encryption and other types of technology to reasonably protect and safeguard your personal information and transactions, whether your purchases are on-line, through our catalogs, in our stores and/or from our service providers. We never display your full credit card information. 

**Product and Service Preferences.**  
You have the option within the website, catalog or store, or when ordering by phone, to provide us with information about your product and/or service preferences, pet information or other interests. You may also provide us with product and service preference information when you participate in the PetPerks program, sweepstakes, surveys and questionnaires of various members of the PETsMART Family. We use this information within the PETsMART Family to improve the level of customization in our stores, catalogs, services and website and to provide better recommendations for you and your pet. 

**E-mail and Direct Mail Offers.**  
To offer you a customized Total Lifetime of Care for your pet, we may also use your mailing, shipping and/or billing address or e-mail address you have provided us to send you special offers from time to time that would be of interest to you. 

**Surveys.**  
From time to time, we may randomly contact customers about participating in a survey about our products, services and/or website. Your feedback helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve and/or develop new products and services for you and your pet. These surveys are always voluntary. 

**PETsMART Family Contests, Promotions, Advertisements and Other Opportunities.**  
If you enter a PETsMART Family contest and/or sweepstakes, we will ask for your name, mailing address, e-mail address and any other information relevant to the particular offer. Unless otherwise noted on the offer, the information you provide us will be kept within the PETsMART Family. 

**Contests, Promotions, Advertisements and Other Opportunities Provided With Select Third Parties.**  
PETsMART may run contests, sweepstakes, advertisements and other promotional offers with select companies outside of the PETsMART Family on our website, by e-mail, in our stores, through our catalogs or by direct mail. When you choose to participate in these contests, sweepstakes or promotional offers, you may be asked to give the third parties your personal information. These businesses operate independently from the PETsMART Family. Any personal information that is given to them is at your option and is not controlled by our Privacy Policy. To avoid confusion, we will identify these businesses as independent from the PETsMART Family. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these businesses if you should have any concerns about how they will treat your personal information. 

**Catalogs.**  
The PETsMART Family has two catalogs from which you may order: State Line Tack and PETsMART (formerly R.C. Steele Pet Supplies). When you purchase products from these catalogs, the personal information you provide us to complete the transaction is collected. Occasionally, we make our catalog customer list available to carefully selected companies whose products and/or services may be of interest to you. However, we respect your privacy and, if you prefer your name to be withheld from such companies, please contact us as noted below in the Opt Out section. [Link to Opt Out]. 

**Research Providers, Shipping Companies, and Consultants.**  
PETsMART hires selective companies to do product and service research, deliver merchandise you have purchased from us, help us be a better, more effective and efficient company, and/or develop new and /or better products and/or services for you and your pet. We also share sales information with third parties to properly process services and returns, place new supplier orders and perform other administrative functions. 

**Legal Requirements.**  
On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose personal information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as required by applicable laws. Also, if the ownership of all or a part of a business within the PETsMART Family were to change, customer information pertinent to that business’s operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner. 

**Change Happens.**  
The PETsMART Family is continually improving its services, offerings, and products to you. This includes adding new functionality and features to its websites, stores and/or catalogs. Because of these changes, changes in technology and/or the law, this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We encourage you to review it each time you visit one of our websites, stores or order from our catalogs to make sure you understand our current practices and policies.
