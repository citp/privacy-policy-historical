PetSmart primarily operates under the names PetSmart and State Line Tack in retail stores in the United States and Canada and through our Internet or "web" sites online at PetSmart.com and Statelinetack.com, among others (collectively, "Site" or "Sites").

**COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**We may collect personal information when you: shop or take advantage of our products and/or services, such as grooming, training, adoption, the PetSmart PetsHotel® and Doggie Day CampSM; establish or update an account with us; enter a contest or sweepstake; sign up and participate in our PetPerks® savings card program; participate in a survey; request a catalog; purchase and/or send an e-gift certificate; create or send a wish list or gift reminder; provide us with comments or suggestions; call our contact center; or subscribe to our newsletters and other programs. We may use your personal information to better assist you when you visit or call us again and to send you special offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. We do this by print advertising, including regular mail and catalogs, by e-mail, and with general marketing communications for product or service-specific information (collectively, "Marketing Communications"). When we collect your personal information, unless you "opt-out", PetSmart may send you Marketing Communications. You may also "opt-out" of future Marketing Communications by following the instructions provided in this Policy under Choices Regarding How Personal Information is Used and Accessing Your Personal Information and through opportunities available to you in our Marketing Communications.

 **When shopping our stores** , if you use a credit/debit card for your purchases, we will collect your credit/debit card information in order to process your purchases and may use your information to keep a history of your purchases. When you return previously purchased merchandise or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to give your name, physical address and phone number, and to show information that identifies you, such as your driver's license. We collect this information to help prevent fraud.

 **When visiting our Sites** , if you register for an online account or for any online offers, we may ask you to provide personal information and to select a password of your own choice to help keep personal information secure. We may use your registration information to help make your online shopping experience and orders quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information.

 **When you make online purchases** , we will collect your name, physical address, phone number, e-mail address and billing/shipping information, as well as credit card information. This information enables us to deliver products that you have ordered; fulfill your requests; contact you or the recipient(s) of your purchase in the event of order or delivery difficulties; verify or respond to your inquiries; and deliver services and information about our products or Site to you. If you make a purchase through our Site, the personal information you provide (for example, name, physical address, and e-mail address) will be added to our customer database. Our customer database may be used to send future Marketing Communications to you unless you specifically opt-out. Note: Online purchases require use of an e-mail address to process the order.

 **When you submit information about other people when you purchase and send an e-gift certificate** , or when you create or send a gift reminder, we consider the information you provide and the content of any personalized message to be private and between you and the recipient. Although PetSmart does not generally use or disclose any information you provide about someone else for any purpose other than to ship the order and confirm delivery, we reserve the right to maintain that information to send future Marketing Communications. We may also use that information to identify or resolve technical problems or customer service issues as necessary, or may need to share that information as required by law or to comply with a court order or other legal process (see more about legal reasons below); to respond to claims that your personalized messages violate the rights of third parties; or to protect the rights or property of PetSmart and its affiliates.

 **When signing up for a PetPerks® savings card or similar program** , we will ask you to provide your name, physical address, phone number, e-mail address and other information about yourself and your pets. We use this information to administer the program; provide customer service; offer new products and services; measure and improve our marketing endeavors and service offerings; tailor our offerings to your preferences; and send you Marketing Communications.

 **If you request a copy of our catalog or purchase products from our catalog** , we will collect your name, physical address, phone number, e-mail address and billing/shipping information, as well as credit card information. This information enables us to deliver products that you have ordered; fulfill your requests; contact you or the recipient(s) of your purchase in the event of order or delivery difficulties; verify or respond to your inquiries; deliver Marketing Communications to you; and add you to our print catalog mailing list. When you request a State Line Tack catalog or make a purchase from our State Line Tack catalog, your name and mailing address may be made available to carefully selected third-party companies whose products and/or services may be of interest to you. If you do not want your name and mailing address included in our print catalog mailing list provided to these third-party companies (other than our authorized service providers), please see Choices Regarding How Personal Information is Used and Accessing Your Personal Information below.

 **When participating in other PetSmart activities** , such as entering a contest or sweepstake, registering for programs, or participating in a survey, or when you contact PetSmart with a question or concern, we may ask you to provide your name, physical address, phone number, e-mail address and other information about yourself and your pets to administer the activity and deliver Marketing Communications to you.

 **We may need to share your personal information but only with carefully selected third-party service providers in order to provide services to you** , such as to fulfill orders (U.S. Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select); process payments; send Marketing Communications; maintain our PetPerks savings card program and other programs; monitor Site activity; conduct surveys; maintain our customer database; send mail and e-mail; and administer drawings, contests, and rebates. We will share your personal information with our carefully selected third-party services providers on a confidential basis. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than providing PetSmart services.

 **We may combine the personal information you provide to us** (on our Site, at our stores, through our catalogs and programs) with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us; improve the accuracy of our customer database (such as the U.S. Post Office to verify accuracy of addresses); increase our understanding of our customers; identify potential customers; and send Marketing Communications.

 **We may be required to disclose your personal information for legal reasons**, such as in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and PetSmart. We may also release personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. We will require such parties to treat your personal information in accordance with our Policy and to use and disclose your personal information solely for the purposes for which it was collected.

 **SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**PetSmart strives to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that the personal information you share with us is handled in a safe, secure and responsible manner. Whether you are shopping online, through our catalogs, or in our retail stores, we have security measures in place to help protect against loss, unauthorized access, and alteration of the information in our control. We will only disclose such information to employees and authorized service providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Policy.

PetSmart's databases are protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that restrict information access to authorized persons in accordance with this Policy. Although no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot ensure against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Our information systems are maintained behind a firewall to isolate them from access by other networks connected to the Internet, and access to personally-identifiable information is granted only to associates who need the information to perform a specific job.

 **SECURE ONLINE SHOPPING  
**Because your credit card security is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure your payment information is processed confidentially, accurately, and securely. Our Site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your credit card information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, physical address, and credit card number.

To provide you with an increased level of security online, when you register for an online account, you may also select a password to access your personal information. PetSmart will not ask you for your password in an unsolicited communication.

**The safety of children is very important to us. Consequently, PetSmart does not knowingly or intentionally collect information from persons under 13 years of age without parental consent. If you are under 13 and wish to purchase items from our Site or wish to provide personal information, ask a parent or guardian for assistance. PetSmart cannot prohibit minors from visiting our Site and must rely on parents and guardians to decide which materials are appropriate for children under 13.
