# PETSMART - CA

PetSmart wants you to know how we collect, use, share and protect information about you online and in our stores. By interacting with us, you consent to our use of information that is collected or submitted as we describe in our privacy policy. We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we urge you to review it periodically.

  * What Information is Collected
  * How is Your Information Used
  * How is Your Information Shared
  * What Choices Do You Have
  * How Do You Access and Update Your Personal Information
  * How is Your Personal Information Protected



### WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED

**Types of personal information we collect include:**

  * Your name
  * Your mailing address
  * Your e-mail address
  * Your phone (or mobile) number
  * Your credit/debit card number
  * Your purchase/return/exchange information
  * Your wish list information
  * Your date of birth or age
  * Your location
  * Your pet’s information (name, breed, date of birth, gender, veterinary information, photographs, etc.)



If you choose not to provide personal information, we may not be able to provide you with requested products, services or information.

**Automated Information Collection**

We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a PetSmart customer. If we are able to identify you as a PetSmart customer, we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in one of our stores. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in-store, mobile, etc.

**PetSmart Automated Information Collection**

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of device you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms and geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits and SMS/text messages you have chosen to receive. We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention and other purposes.

In order to provide the best customer experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.

**Third-Party Automated Information Collection**

In certain instances, we allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website and to use that information to serve ads for PetSmart products and services or for the products and services of other companies when you visit our website or other websites. These companies use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.

**Our Mobile App and Mobile Website**

Our PetSmart mobile app is downloadable onto smart phones and serves as a mechanism to take you to our mobile website. Our mobile applications do not currently collect personally identifiable information. Our mobile website collects the same type of information outlined throughout this policy.

**PetPerks® Loyalty Program – Automatic Number Assignment**

Beginning in 2014, PetSmart may automatically assign a PetPerks number to customers for whom we have other identifying information, such as a phone number or email address. This enables our customers to take advantage of our many promotions throughout the store and will allow us to better customize our offers.

**User Experience Information**

In order to improve your online shopping experience, help with fraud identification, and to assist our customer service representatives in resolving issues you may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g. information entered during checkout process), and browser information.

**Social Media Widgets**

petsmart.com includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, YouTube and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.

**Information from Other Sources**

We may collect data that’s publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g. a blog, chat room, or social media) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.

We also obtain information provided by third parties. For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing customer information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our customers (for example, adding address information). This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you.

**In-Store Cameras**

We use in-store cameras for security purposes and for operational purposes such as measuring and observing customer traffic patterns.

**Geo-Location Tracking**

Certain mobile devices contain geo-location tracking capability. We may use such capability or other geo-location tracking technology to generally identify your location in our store or your close proximity to it for marketing, to generate coupons and other offers, for analytical purposes and to prompt our associates as to which customers may need help.

### HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION USED

Examples of how we use the information we collect include (but are not limited to):

  * Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, returns/exchanges, or requests for information about our products and services in our stores, website, or mobile website, or to otherwise serve you.

  * Provide services such as Wish Lists.

**Photographs and Information About Your Pet**

We may take photographs of your pet and send them to you or your designated family members/agents via email or text to let you know, for example, that your pet is ready for pick up (e.g. in the salon), that your pet is doing well (e.g. during a stay in the hotel) or to commemorate that s/he has learned a new trick (e.g. in training class). We may also use the photographs on social media. Unless you ask the store associate who took your information not to do so, your email and phone number will automatically be entered into our customer database and may be used for operational and marketing purposes as provided for in this policy. Your pet’s photograph(s) may also be uploaded into the database and associated with your name.

To prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft and otherwise protect our customers and our business
