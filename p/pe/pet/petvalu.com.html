                  access and use our website (the "Site"). Pet Valu, Inc.,
                  its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively "Pet Valu")
                  only gathers personally identifiable information regarding
                  visitors to the Site (such as names, street addresses, phone
                  or fax numbers, email addresses, etc) when a visitor
                  voluntarily submits such information to Pet Valu. Except (a)
                  when we need to share such information with companies that
                  work on behalf of Pet Valu (as where a visitor to the Site
                  requests to receive information on Pet Valu special offers),

                  necessary to preserve the integrity or security of the Site
                  or to prevent injury to Pet Valu or (c) when disclosure is
                  required by law (as in response to a
                  subpoena or governmental investigation), such personally
                  identifiable information, when it is so voluntarily
                  submitted, is <b><u>not</u></b> provided, transferred or
                  otherwise disseminated to third parties outside of Pet Valu.
                  Such personally identifiable information, when voluntarily
                  submitted by a visitor to the Site, never is sold or rented
                  to third parties outside of Pet Valu.

                  identifiable information from an individual who is (or who
