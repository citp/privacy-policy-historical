  * We may share the information collected about you within the Petco family of companies, which means we may disclose the information collected about you to our affiliates (subject to the terms of this privacy policy).

### Security Measures for Information Collected Through Our Sites

To help protect the privacy of information collected through our Sites, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices. In addition, we take commercially reasonable steps to store such information with the objective of protecting such data against unauthorized access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, please be aware that our Sites are operated on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control and that may compromise the security of information collected about you. 

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. You understand that it may be possible for third parties not under Petco's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through one of our Sites or via email. Accordingly, although we undertake commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through our Sites, due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization. Any such transmission of information about you to Petco is at your own risk.

### How to Correct or Update Information About You Collected Through Our Sites

You may correct or update information collected about you through any of our Sites by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy below, or (if available on a particular Site) by editing your information and preferences on the "My Account" page. You may also unsubscribe to any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible. 

We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements. In addition, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through any of the Sites that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

At this time, our Sites do not support "Do Not Track" preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, our Sites are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. For more information about Do Not Track, visit [donottrack.us](http://donottrack.us/). 

### Transfer of Data from Outside the United States

If you use any of our Sites from outside of the United States, information that we collect about you through the Site will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely. By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of data about you into the United States, as well as the processing of such data in the United States. 

### Children

Our Sites are not designed to appeal to persons under 13 years old ("children"). We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through our Sites, except for persistent identifiers that may be collected through children's sections of our Sites which (as permitted by applicable law) we will use solely to support the internal operations of the Sites. If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided any such personal information to us, then you may contact us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy below and request that we delete that information from our systems.

### Privacy Policies of any Linked Websites or Other Parties

This privacy policy only addresses Petco's practices for the personal (and other) information that we may obtain about you through any of the Sites. Please be aware that when you use or access any of the Sites, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Petco is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked websites. We would expect most, if not all, of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. However, Petco is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless whether they are linked or otherwise connected to our Sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy and terms of use whenever interacting with any third-party website, app, or other offering.

### Your California Privacy Rights

From time to time, we may share information collected about you with our affiliates and/or other third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Under California law, a California resident with whom we have an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information that we have shared with third parties for these purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to us at [CaliforniaPrivacyRights@petco.com](mailto:CaliforniaPrivacyRights@petco.com).

### Governing Law

By choosing to visit any of our Sites, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this privacy policy will be governed by the law of the State of California, without reference to the choice of law or conflicts of law principles thereof, and will be subject to the dispute resolution clause contained in the terms of use applicable to the particular Site. You also agree to abide by any limitation on damages contained in the terms of use applicable to the Site or any other agreement that we have with you.
