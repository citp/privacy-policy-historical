**Your information is secure**  
At PETCO.com our customers' data is strictly protected against any unauthorized access. PETCO.com also provides a "100% Safeguard Your Shopping Experience Guarantee" so you never have to worry about the safety of your credit card information. 

Protecting your order information is a priority. PETCO.com makes every effort to protect your online order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. 

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than PETCO.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the bottom of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In these cases, you'll be unable to connect to the server, so you won't have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. 

| PETCO also supports the Verified by Visa Security Service. Learn more about this feature... |

**Privacy Policy**  
At PETCO.com we are concerned with protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to provide a personalized shopping experience. We may also use it to tell you about special offers that we think you'd appreciate. You'll never have to worry about receiving a barrage of unexpected e-mail from us if you have not subscribed with us. We will not sell, rent or trade your information. 

We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. They are restricted from using this data for other purposes, and in any way other than to provide the requested services to PETCO.com, and may not alter or resell the data. You may elect to opt-out of personally identifiable site tracking activity by following the Opt-out link below. Keep in mind that PETCO.com may continue to collect anonymous aggregate site behavior from our customers. [Opt-out](http://www.petco.com/coremetrics/optout.asp?webt=0&). 

We may occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures offer promotions on PETCO.com. You have the option to specifically opt-in to participate in the promotion and share your personal data with these parties and PETCO.com. These promotions may be in the form of a survey or a separate area offering you the opportunity to enter your data for the specific purpose of participating in that program or promotion. Data collected by these third-parties will be covered under the third-party's Privacy Policy agreement. 

There is a possibility that PETCO, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, its affiliates, or any combination of such, could merge with, acquire, or be acquired by another business entity. If such an action occurs, PETCO would like to let you know that some or all of the personal information collected about you would be shared with this entity in order to continue to provide reliable service. Notice of such an event will be posted on this page, and we will require that all parties follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise noted. 

When registering with petco.com, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and e-mail address. We will use the customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. If you do not wish to receive future mailing, see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below. 

Sometimes you will provide us with data that doesn't reveal your personal identity - what type of pet you're interested in, for example. We use this sort of information for editorial and personalization purposes, and occasionally for other internal purposes (maybe we'll show cat owners a certain ad, for example) but we do not connect it to any name, address or other personal identifying information. This way we can give you customized information without compromising your privacy. 

We reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we might report to potential advertisers that a certain percentage of our users are interested in parrot behavior, based on online surveys or other requests. 

We use a third party agent to handle our email marketing and you may refer to [their privacy policy here.](http://www.rsvp0.net/)

**Surveys, Contests, and Other Special Programs**   
**Surveys**  
Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like your e-mail address) and demographic information (like your zip code or age). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about PETCO.com and our promotions. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

From time to time we may conduct contests or other promotions or request material for publication. To participate, you usually must supply us with your true identity, which you agree to have publicly associated with your submission. The exact rules vary from case to case, and will be noted clearly on the relevant pages. Your participation will always be voluntary and knowing. Contact information will be used in order to notify contest winners.
