# Petri.il.co Privacy Policy

Your Guarantee of Privacy 

## We hate SPAM too! We respect your privacy and here’s what we do everyday to protect it: 

### CHOICE & CONSENT / THIRD PARTY USE

Your email address will ONLY be known by us. This one is really important so it bears repeating. We will NOT sell, rent, or loan your name to third parties for e-mail marketing (nobody-not ever!). When you subscribe to IT Knowledgebase Digest, we collect only enough information to allow us to deliver your Knowledgebase Digest to you. We keep this information so that we can continue to send you the Digest weekly. On occasion (no more than twice a month – we promise!) you may receive an IT announcement from Petri.co.il on behalf of our sponsors. 

### UNSUBSCRIBE / OPT-OUT

We send emails only to people who have sent us email addresses to subscribe to Knowledgebase Digest or otherwise request information from us. We never get email addresses from any other sources. If you don't want to receive our mailings, please let us know via our [ Feedback](http://www.petri.co.il/feedback.htm) page. We will promptly remove your name from our list at your request. You may also choose to opt-out of receiving future emails from us by simply clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of each communication you receive from us. 

### THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Cookies are a good thing, but only when used in a responsible manner to help our visitors, not snoop on them. We use cookies (1) to identify shoppers with their shopping carts, (2) to make it easy for you order a second time, (3) to allow you to store passwords if you so desire, (4) to give proper credit for sales made through links on our affiliates' sites, and (5) to track general statistics and site referrals. We do NOT collect or use information from cookies to develop a profile about you. 

You should note that third parties may be placing and reading cookies on your web browser, or using web beacons to collect information for advertising purposes.
