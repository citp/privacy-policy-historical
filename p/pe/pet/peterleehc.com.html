<br>
peterleehc.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,
e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms
of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email
address to any unauthorized third party. Period."<br>
<br>
<b>How we gather information from users</b><br>
<br>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You
may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of
our site. Like most Web sites, peterleehc.com also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize
you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having
to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather
information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not
to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s
features according to your preferences.<br>
<br>
<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
<br>
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect
your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br>
<br>
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify
you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information
about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other
users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages
are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated
Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and
business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.<br>
<br>
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
peterleehc.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;
services and products offered by peterleehc.com and other topics we
think you might find of interest.<br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by peterleehc.com may
also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications
with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the
operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access
such information. We will use your information only as permitted by
law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our
business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the
transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably
required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts
you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you
with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
<br>
<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
<br>
peterleehc.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other
content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a
peterleehc.com page, certain content that is actually created or
hosted by a third party. Also, through peterleehc.com you may be
introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,
contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. peterleehc.com is
not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You
should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.<br>
<br>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third
parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some
of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example,
some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include
cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a
particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site
may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or
other technology to gather information. peterleehc.com does
not
control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting
information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such
third parties.<br>
<br>
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by
third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
beyond the control of peterleehc.com and this policy.<br>
<br>
<b>Children</b><br>

peterleehc.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as

a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that
information immediately. If you believe peterleehc.com has any
