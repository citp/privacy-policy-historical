#### USE OF COOKIES

As with most websites, we use cookies, web beacons, and other online information-gathering tools in connection with our site. These tools are intended to make our site easier to use by, among other things, saving your preferences for you. A cookie is a small file stored by your internet browser on your computer. We may use either a "session cookie" and/or a "persistent cookie". A "session cookie" stores temporary information that is erased when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. A "persistent cookie" enables our site to recognize you when you return to it and remains stored on your computer until you delete it. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. We do not have access to or control over web beacons or cookies may be used by our third party service providers. 

The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Chewy's essential features; if you set your browser to limit or remove cookies or otherwise block our use of cookies, some features of the site may be unavailable or unable to function properly.

#### ANALYTICS

We may use third party analytics services to help analyze how users use the site. Analytics services use cookies to collect information such as how often users use the site and what features they use in the site and what products they view on the site. We use this information to improve the site and to market and promote our site and products to you on third party sites. The analytics services' ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information. You may find the privacy policy of our third party provider here: http://www.criteo.com/privacy.

#### MOBILE LOCATION

If you access the site through a mobile device, we may also be able to identify the location of your mobile device.

Therefore, you may always opt-out of our targeted advertising by visiting the DAA consumer opt-out page at www.aboutads.info/choices. Opting out will not mean that you will no longer receive Chewy ads, rather, it just means that those ads will not be targeted to you based upon data collected from you on this site.
