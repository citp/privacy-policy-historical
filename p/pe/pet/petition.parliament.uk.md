## Privacy notice: how we use your data

Last update: May 25 2018

The Petitions site lets you start and sign petitions to raise issues with the UK Government and Parliament.

The Petitions service is provided by the Government and the House of Commons. We need to collect, process and store some personal data to enable you to do this.

A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. The Cabinet Office (part of the Government) and the House of Commons are joint data controllers of this site.

[Read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053) for more information.

[Read the House of Commons entry in the Data Protection Public Register](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z8887540) for more information.

The data controller for the House of Commons is the Clerk of the House.

### What data we collect from you

The personal data we collect from people who start and sign petitions will include:

  * your name
  * your email address
  * your postcode
  * the country you live in
  * whether you are a British citizen
  * the IP address you use when starting or signing a petition



The legal basis for processing this data is public task – allowing you to raise issues with the UK Government and Parliament.

### Why we need your data

We use this information to:

  * make sure that people only sign a petition once
  * check that you’re eligible to sign a petition
  * contact you about petitions you start
  * if you consent, email you updates about what happens in Parliament petitions you’ve signed



### What we do with your data

If you start a petition and we accept it, your name will be published with the petition. We won’t publish any other personal information about you.

If you’ve signed a petition, we won’t publish any personal information about you.

We’ll use your postcode to work out how many people in each parliamentary constituency have signed a petition.

We will not:

  * sell or rent your data to third parties
  * share your data with third parties for marketing purposes



We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

### What we’ll email you about

If a petition you’ve started or signed gets a response from the Government, we’ll email the response to you.

If you’ve started or signed a petition, we might contact you to let you know about relevant things that are happening in Parliament and Government. That might include: debates that you can watch or read, chances to respond to a consultation, or ways to let MPs know why the petition is important to you.

You can stop these emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email.

### How long we keep your data

We will retain your personal data from the date you start or sign a petition, until 6 months after that petition closes – a maximum of 12 months in total.

### Where your data is processed and stored

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.

All personal data on Petitions is processed, stored and managed entirely in the European Economic Area (EEA), and will not be transferred outside of it. This means that it is covered by EU Data Protection regulations.

### How we protect your data and keep it secure

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process personal data for us are required to keep that data secure.
