#### Information You Provide to Us.

  * **1.     Registration**. When you register to use our Services, we collect information that helps us identify you and helps us to administer your account. The more information you provide, the better we can customize our services and your experience to suit your needs and preferences. Upon creating an account, we ask for certain information from you, including your name and email address, and may also include your phone number and physical address as well as billing and payment information.

The Site may contain video postings, message boards, chat rooms, personal web pages or profiles, forums, bulletin boards, and other interactive features that allow you to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit to other users content or materials on or through the Site (collectively, “User Contributions”). All information you provide may become public on the Site, including any partner or affiliate pages. Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Services with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

Accordingly, the Company will not store payment information in its system. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Services will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of Stripe and your credit card issuer in addition to those terms specified herein. The Company is not responsible for any errors by Stripe.

As you navigate through and interact with our Services, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns, including:

A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies, but this will prevent you from using most customized services, and you may have to repeatedly enter personal information in order to participate in various services or promotions. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords. We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size and determine which areas of the Website are the most popular. For more information about how cookies may affect your privacy, please visit http://allaboutcookies.org/privacy-concerns/. 
  * **2.      IP Address**. We may log information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type, for the purposes of systems administration, or to report information in aggregate form third parties such as advertisers (for example, to identify how many visitors logged in to our Website). We do not provide such third parties with personally identifiable information. 
  * **3.      Usage Details**. We may log details of your visits to our Site and use of our Services, including the resources that you access and use. 
  * **4.      Advertisements**. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may collect aggregated information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements of interest to you.   
We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). See below for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on this website and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking 



The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information. This data helps us to improve our Services and to deliver better and more personalized features to you, including by enabling us to:

  * Estimate our audience size and usage patterns. 
  * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Services according to your individual interests. 
  * Speed up your searches.

We assume no responsibility or liability for these third party policies or the actions of non-affiliated third parties. 
  * To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide your information, such as connecting AWOs with pet lovers. 
  * In any other way we may describe when you provide the information. 
  * For any other purpose with your consent.

## What Are Your Choices About How We Use and Share Your Information?

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to give you the following controls over your information: 

**Tracking Technologies**. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. For further information about how to do so, please refer to your browser “help” tool, or see www.allaboutcookies.org. Note that if you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may be inaccessible or not function properly. You may also be able to opt out of mobile advertising identifiers and other non-cookie technologies. Note that, even if you opt out, these tracking technologies may still collect data and you will still see ads, but they will not be targeted based on the information collected from you. At this time, we do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. If you would like to learn more about your ability to limit the information automatically shared with us and with third-party advertisers, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. 

**Promotional Offers from Petstablished**. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by Petstablished to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to support@petstablished.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, the email will have an “unsubscribe” feature that will allow you to opt-out of receiving future email distributions. 

## How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?

You may send us an e-mail at support@petstablished.com to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete all of your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. 

If you delete your User Contributions from the Services, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Services users. Proper access and use of information provided on the Services, including User Contributions, is governed by our Terms of Use. 

## How Is Your Information Kept Secure?

We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls and will be backed up on at least a weekly basis. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Services like the message boards or forums. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Services.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.

## What If There Are Changes to Our Privacy Policy?

We post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat your personal information, we will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account, if you have one.
