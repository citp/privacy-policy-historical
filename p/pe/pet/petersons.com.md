# Peterson's Terms

Nelnet wants you to understand how we collect, protect and use your personal information and the choices you have about how that information is used. This notice covers all of the information handling practices for the Nelnet companies listed at the end of this notice.

**Online Information**  
We at Nelnet are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, and to protecting your personal information during your visit. When you access a Nelnet Web site, you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. We may collect information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all information we collect is treated as confidential.

To access student loan account information and send email via our Web site, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0 or greater, MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet.

If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the lower left corner of your screen; when the session is not secure, the key will appear broken. Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure Web site, Internet Explorer displays a lock in an unlocked position on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select "Properties". If the Web site address (URL) starts with "https" the "s" indicates a secure site or area of the site.

When you enter a Nelnet Web site, you will pass through our security "firewall" and we identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of you computer or handheld device, The IP address won't identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you're using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.

Nelnet Web sites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive (with your permission) by a Web page server. Accepting a cookie from a Nelnet Web site does not give Nelnet access to your computer of any personal information about you. Also, the type of cookies we use don't get stored permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser and are deleted. You can also set up your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set.

If you supply us with your email address we may let you know by email about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you don't want to receive future messages with each message you receive. If you send us an email question or comment, we will use your email address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your email address this way, we won't use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission. If you are not comfortable that your email system is secure, you can always contact Customer Service by telephone.

We don't knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our Web sites about children under age 13. If we find out we have collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose Web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where you may shop.

Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Nelnet Web site, even though you may have started your visit at the Nelnet site, and even though Nelnet pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with Nelnet. We don't share your personal information with them, but information you choose to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value and excellent customer service you expect from Nelnet.

**Information we collect and why**  
In order to provide you with products and services, we collect information about you from different sources:

  * Information you provide to us on forms (such as applications), in writing, by telephone or through one of our Web sites.

We may share all the information we have collected about you with our affiliated companies. If you prefer we not share third party consumer report information collected about you with our affiliated companies, you may instruct us not to do so by submitting to us a completed [Nelnet Privacy Option form](http://www.nelnet.net/includes/privacy.pdf "Nelnet Privacy Option form")* and checking option number 1. We may continue to share other information about you within these affiliated companies as required or permitted by law.

  * To report to a credit bureau.
  * In the case of student loans, to report to a guaranty agency, school, or the U.S. Department of Education.

You may provide your consent by submitting to us a completed Nelnet Privacy Option form and check option number 3.

Nelnet will automatically handle accounts with California addresses as if the account holder has selected not to have information shared with limited third parties offering educational and financial products, services and opportunities unless we receive your consent to share information with these limited third parties.
