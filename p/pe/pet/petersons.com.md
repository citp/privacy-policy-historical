# Peterson's Terms

This privacy statement is designed to help you understand how we use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us. This privacy statement describes the practices of petersons.com, cyberedit.com, essayedge.com, resumeedge.com, termpaperedge.com, and webresume.com, members of the Thomson Learning family of companies.

Please note that this website provides direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites, where you can apply for products and services (such as student loans) or register for more information. This privacy statement does not describe the practices of our partners. Before disclosing personal information on any other company's web site, you should read the privacy policy associated with that site. 

Information That We Collect

When you visit our Web site, you may provide us with information in different ways. For example, you may register with us or sign up for our newsletter. Or, you may complete search forms to get information from us about things like colleges or financial aid. Additionally, we collect information on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our web site. 

The types of information we ask for varies with the search you're conducting. In addition to your name and contact information, we will ask for other information related to the topic. For example, in order to personalize your search for a college, we may ask about your high school graduation date, school performance, desired college locations, and career goals. If you request document editing services from us, you will provide a copy of the letter, essay or resume you want us to revise.

How We Use the Information 

In general, we use the information you provide in order to:

  * respond to your requests for information  

  * provide the services you request  

  * provide customer service   

  * provide links between targeted product and service providers and appropriate individuals 



For example, if you request information on financial aid, we will send you that information. If you so choose, we can also provide your information to those marketing partners who offer financial aid packages so they may send you information on their products and services. 

If you request editing or resume writing services, we provide those services and bill you for the services as instructed. We do NOT sell any personal information from essays or resumes to any third parties. For example, unlike some resume services, we do not sell resume information to job posting boards. The full policy regarding use of customer information can be found in the Terms of Service that you must check to complete your order.

If you purchase a product or service on our site, you may provide us with a credit card number. This credit card number will only be used to process your purchase. We will not disclose credit card numbers to third parties for marketing purposes under any circumstances. 

In general, it is our policy to share information with other companies in the Thomson family (such as other Thomson Learning companies) unless you tell us not to by opting out. Unless you agree (by opting in), we will not share personal information about you with unrelated companies except as needed to complete your transaction. However, we may disclose any information when legally compelled to do so or when needed for the protection of our legal rights. For example, we may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena or government investigation. We may also disclose information about you in connection with the transfer of assets of our business.

At registration, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of Thomson Peterson's internal promotions, offers and marketing messages. You will also be given the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers from partners and third parties.

Promotions, Surveys and Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via promotions, surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), segmentation information (such as high school student, parent, etc.) and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to process entries, send promotional material, notify the winners and award prizes.

Email A Friend/Tell A Friend

If a user elects to participate in our referral program for recruiting friends to become a customer of the site, we ask the user to provide the email address of the friend who will then receive a one-time email message. Friends recruited through this program will register with us and enjoy all of the benefits of being a user.

Special Offers

We send all new members a welcoming email. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see description of our opt-out policy above.
