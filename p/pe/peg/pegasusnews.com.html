  <br> From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. &nbsp;If we make changes, we will post them on the Website to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A user is bound by any changes to the policy when she or he uses the Website after those changes have been posted.&nbsp; If, however, we intend to disclose users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will post a notice of such intent on the Website 30 days prior to such action.

      You can continue, but the site will not appear as we intended.

      Fear not! You can solve this problem at no cost by updating your browser for free. You can:

    <ul class="attention_message">

        current version

      </li>
      <li>
        Try our favorite browser,

    </ul>
    <p>
      We are working to make our site work with older browsers too, but with fewer than 10% of 
      web users still on the old Internet Explorer, we had to focus on the software 
      that would reach the most people with the most useful gizmos. We understand that some offices and 
      public institutions are on older software and aren't allowed to update. 
      We'll circle back for you as soon as possible.
