Pegasystems is committed to protecting your privacy. We are providing this Privacy & Security statement to inform you of our Privacy & Security policy and practices, and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. We've structured our corporate Web site, www.pega.com, so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Authentication is required, however, to enter Pegasystems' Support Network (for customers) and Partner Network (for our strategic business and technology partners). 

This statement applies to www.pega.com as well as Pegasystems' Support Network and Partner Network sites; it does not apply to other offline Pegasystems sites, products or services. 

**1\. Links to Non-Pegasystems Web Sites**

Our Web sites may provide links to third-party Web sites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the Pegasystems Web sites. Pegasystems does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party Web sites. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the Pegasystems Privacy & Security statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. 

**2\. Types of Information We Collect**

This Privacy & Security statement covers personal information, non-personal data collection and aggregate reporting. 

  * **Personal information** is information that is associated with your name or personal identity. Pegasystems uses personal information to understand better your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. Once you choose to provide us with personal information, it will be used to support your customer or partner relationship with Pegasystems. We take seriously the trust you place in us. Pegasystems will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. 

On some pages within our sites, you can request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, or apply for a job at Pegasystems. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data. 

To personalize our Web sites, services or communications and improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional.



  * **Non-personal information** is data about usage and service operation that is not associated with a specific personal identity. Pegasystems collects and analyzes non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use the Pegasystems Web sites. 

Non-personal data we collect may include the pages visited on the Pegasystems Web sites, unique URLs visited within www.pega.com, browser type and IP address. Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. Pegasystems' Web pages use cookies, Web beacons and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services. Pegasystems also places advertisements on other Web sites that may use cookies. 




Personal data collected online may also be combined with information you provide Pegasystems through other sources such as product registration, call centers or public events such as trade shows or seminars. 

Personal data given to Pegasystems may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management. 

Non-personal data gathered from Pegasystems' Web sites is aggregated for reporting about usability, performance and effectiveness. It is used to improve the customer experience, usability and site content. 

**3\. Who We Share Your Information With**

Pegasystems will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Pegasystems will not share your personal information with third parties except in responding to your requests for products or services. Your permission will be requested when you submit your information. Pegasystems shares customer information across Pegasystems-owned business entities and companies working on our behalf, but only as described above in "Types of Information We Collect". 

Pegasystems contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions described above in "Types of Information We Collect". Suppliers and service providers are generally required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Pegasystems and may generally not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Pegasystems. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers.  

Pegasystems or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets could be acquired. 

**4\. Access to and Accuracy of Your Information**

Pegasystems strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to help maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. Certain areas of Pegasystems' Web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers. 

**5\. Keeping Your Information Secure**

Pegasystems is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to facilitate the appropriate use of the information, Pegasystems has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 

**6\. Changes to this Statement**

If there are updates to the terms of Pegasystems' online Privacy & Security statement, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you may know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have.
