Registered users may choose not to receive promotional emails from us by changing the “Do not send me promotional emails” setting within their personal profile, although such users may still receive emails from us concerning non-promotional Website communications. Registered users may communicate with each other through the Website without disclosing their email addresses. 

Cell phone numbers are used to send text and voice message notifications related to the Website and to communicate offers.
