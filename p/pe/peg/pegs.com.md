# Privacy Policy – Pegasus Solutions

## General

Pegasus respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Statement is meant to inform you of how we collect, use and protect your personal information, and the choices you have in this regard.

In particular, Pegasus is committed to complying with the European Community Directive on Data Protection, commonly referred to as the "EU Privacy Directive". Pegasus has chosen to comply with the EU Privacy Directive by certifying our compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbor" program. Pegasus adheres to the principles of the Safe Harbor program, which are Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access and Accuracy, Security, and Oversight/Enforcement. More information on the program can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

## Application of this Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement applies to Pegasus Solutions, Inc. and each of its controlled subsidiaries (frequently collectively referred to as "Pegasus"). This Privacy Statement applies to all of Pegasus' products and services, as well as each of Pegasus' websites collecting personal information, including without limitation [www.pegs.com](http://www.pegs.com/). A more complete description of Pegasus products and services and be found at [www.pegs.com](http://www.pegs.com/). As described below, this Privacy Statement also applies to Pegasus Human Resources information concerning Pegasus employees in the European Union.

Pegasus' services relate primarily to travel-related reservations, and most commonly involve processing relating to hotel room reservations. However, Pegasus' processing services may apply to other types of transactions, such that references below to "hotels" or "hotel companies" may apply to other types of transactions you may seek to conduct. For example, Pegasus may process commission transactions relating to your car rental, train reservation or airline reservation.

This Privacy Statement applies to "personal information," meaning such information that is easily identifiable with a specific individual. This Privacy Statement does not apply to statistical or other information from which your personally identifiable information cannot be determined.

## How we collect information

Pegasus may obtain information about you in connection with our service offerings in several ways, including through central reservation systems, call centers, travel agents, Internet websites and database networks. For example, personal information is generally collected in connection with a hotel reservation you make using one of our systems or the system of one of our hotel or travel agent customers.

## Types of information we collect

Pegasus generally collects only such personal information as is reasonably necessary to facilitate reservation, payment and commission processing transactions. Such information may include without limitation such basic information as your name, address, telephone and credit card information. Other information collected may include travel agent information, airline flight information, frequent guest/loyalty program numbers or membership information, other group discount program affiliations, hotel and room rate information, arrival and departure dates as well as special accommodation requirements.

Pegasus generally does not require or request any "sensitive data", that is, information pertaining to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, union membership, health or sex life. However, we may collect certain sensitive data solely in order to facilitate the accommodation of any special considerations you may have in connection with your reservation, such as special medical or dietary requirements. In addition, sensitive data could be inferred from your group or loyalty program information, or from other special preferences you may provide in connection with your reservation. However, Pegasus does not use or share any such information for any purpose other than as described below.

## How we use your information

We use your personal information to facilitate the provision of our services, and allow your chosen hotel company, travel agent or other service provider to provide its services to you. Specifically, your personal information is used to process your hotel reservation, as well as to process any commission or other amounts that may be payable to your travel agent or other intermediary in connection with your reservation. Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention.

Any "sensitive data" is collected only to facilitate accommodation of any special considerations you may have in connection with your reservation, and/or to process your reservation transactions properly, such as at the appropriate group discount rate.

We may use your personal information in order to update you with our marketing activities. However, you may opt-out of receiving such information at any time. We have no control over whether your personal information is used for marketing or other activities by your hotel company, travel agent or other intermediary.

## Who we share your information with; Your information and third party companies

Pegasus does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Pegasus will not share your personal information with third parties except in connection with the provision of our services to you and/or your hotel company, travel agent or other intermediary. We have no control over whether your personal information is used for marketing or other activities by your hotel company, travel agent or other intermediary.

Pegasus contracts with third-party service providers in connection with the performance of our services. For example, Pegasus uses certain banking institutions to process commission payments. Such third-party service providers are generally required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Pegasus and may not use any such personal information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Pegasus. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better serve our customers.

Pegasus may share your personal information across its various business entities and service lines, all of which are generally subject to the requirements of this Privacy Statement. Pegasus may also combine with or be acquired by another business entity, in which case your information may be shared with such entity.

Pegasus will not otherwise share personal information with any other third parties without your permission, unless we assess such disclosure to be required by law.

## Your choices, privacy preferences and opting out

Since we generally only provide information to your hotel company, travel agent or other intermediary in connection with your transactions, if you do not wish for such third parties to obtain your personal information, then please be aware that we may not be able to process your intended transaction. If you still do not wish for us to share your information with such parties, then contact our Privacy Office at the contact information listed below.

If you do not wish for your personal information to be disclosed to any of our third party service providers, please contact our Privacy Office at the contact information listed below. Within a reasonable time after receiving your request to not distribute your personal information to such third parties, we will either cease any further distribution to such third parties or notify you if such cessation is not reasonably practicable. Please keep in mind that if Pegasus cannot disclose or share your information with such third parties, then we may not be able to provide you with all or certain of our reservation, transaction processing or other services.

Pegasus may send marketing information about its products and services to its affiliated travel agents, hotel companies and other business partners, but such marketing information generally will not contain your personal information. Pegasus generally does not send marketing information to individual providers of personal information. However, if you are receiving Pegasus marketing materials and do not wish to receive such materials, please contact our Privacy Office at the contact information listed below. Pegasus generally has no control over the marketing and other onward distribution activities of travel agents, hotel companies and other participants in your transactions.

Pegasus will make all reasonable efforts to honor your preferences.

Pegasus strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain data accuracy. Upon request to our Privacy Office, we will use all reasonable efforts to provide you with access to your information, including the opportunity to change your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to your data. Certain areas of Pegasus' websites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.

Certain personal information stored on Pegasus systems is routinely deleted as it determined to become irrelevant. However, such routine deletion practices vary with respect to different services and types of information and some information may be stored indefinitely.

The most effective way to ensure the accuracy of your personal information in our records is to take care that you, your hotel, your agent or other intermediary inputs your information correctly.

## Keeping your information secure

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, Pegasus has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

Our data centers and systems employ various layers of access codes and monitoring to prevent unauthorized access, and authorized access to your personal information is generally restricted to our representatives with a reasonable need for such access. We generally employ 128 bit encryption methods when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.

Each Pegasus employee is generally subject to a confidentiality agreement, which would further restrict unauthorized disclosure of your personal information.

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and fraud prevention.

## Human Resources Information

Pegasus collects certain personal information about its employees in the European Union, which Pegasus uses solely in connection with Pegasus' employment-related activities. Employee information may also be shared with Pegasus entities or third party service providers (such as Pegasus' benefits providers) outside of the EU solely in connection with Pegasus' employment-related activities. Pegasus has reasonable security measures to protect such personal information. Pegasus employees should contact their supervisor or the Human Resources department if they have more questions about their personal information, including their options regarding access and preferences.
