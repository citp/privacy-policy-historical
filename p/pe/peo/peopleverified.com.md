## What does this privacy policy cover?

This policy covers how PeopleVerified.com treats personal information that we collect and receive from you, including information related to your use of our website, products, and services.

If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit. 

## What information do we collect?

We collect some information that is personal (i.e. information that identifies you, either alone or in combination with other data.) We also collect information that is non-personal and does not, on its own, identify you. When non-personal information is combined with other information so that it does identify you, we treat that combination as personal information.

  * Credit card or other billing account information
  * Billing address
  * Transaction-related information

    * Your legal name
    * Your current residence
    * Your Social Security Number
    * Knowledge-based authentication questions that only you would know

Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. 

  * As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
