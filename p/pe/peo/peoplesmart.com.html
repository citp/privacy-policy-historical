	<p class="wpText mb1">
		Welcome to PeopleSmart.com, a website designed to help you find information available in public records.
		This privacy policy is for visitors and registered users ("you") of PeopleSmart.com (the "website" or "service"), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. (“Inflection”, "we" or "our"):
	</p>
	<p class="wpText">

	What is covered by this privacy policy?
</h2>
<p class="wpText mb1">
	This privacy policy covers PeopleSmart.com, which is designed to help you find public records information about yourself and others. This site is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the <a href="https://www.peoplesmart.com/fcra" target="_blank">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA). Visit <a href="https://www.goodhire.com/gh.aspx?_act=landing&amp;cam=6336" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoodHire.com</a> for all your employment screening needs.
</p>

<h2 class="wpSubTitle">
	What isn’t covered by this policy?
</h2>
<p class="wpText">
	This privacy policy only applies to information collected by this website, which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. This policy does not apply to the practices of other website domains that this site links to, to other Inflection services, to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.

	<strong>Note:</strong> If you consent to the release of your information via another Inflection product or service (e.g., a background report on GoodHire.com), your public records will be shared for the purpose you specify.

This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. Please see the “What This Policy Covers”.

</p>
<p class="wpText">
