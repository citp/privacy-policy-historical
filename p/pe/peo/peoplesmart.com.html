              <li>We may collect, create, use and disclose, in our discretion, any data that does not permit the identification of an individual (e.g., aggregated data or data in which we exclude information, such as your name, email, and address, that makes the data personally identifiable to you).</li>

Similarly, we may use that information, in conjunction with our security partners and / or law enforcement to assist those we reasonably believe to have been victimized by such fraudulent use of the Website and Services.
