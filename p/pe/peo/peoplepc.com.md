When you register as a PeoplePC Member, you will provide to us the following Personal Data: your name, telephone number, date of birth, billing and shipping addresses, email address and billing information (i.e., a credit card or debit account number). In addition, when you register, you will choose a Member Name and Password. You may also be asked to provide Personal Data when registering for other online services provided by PeoplePC. PeoplePC and its partners (see below) may use your contact information to ship your purchases to you and to provide membership services to you.

We may use your Personal Data to communicate with you via email or conventional mail. These communications may relate to PeoplePC or to products and/or services offered by our merchant partners. We may use your Personal Data to communicate with you via telephone about your PeoplePC account.

**Information you decide to publish on the Internet.**  
You may supply additional information about yourself in your online activities. For instance, you may publish your own web page or participate in online chat rooms. You have decided to make this information publicly available on the Internet. Information you voluntarily publish is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Responses to promotional events and contests.** From time to time PeoplePC or its partners may conduct contests or other promotional events. As a condition of participating in these events, Members may be asked to provide Personal Data. You will be notified of the use to be made of such information at the time the information is requested, and you will have the opportunity to decline to participate. Information you provide through promotional events will be used as disclosed in the event solicitation materials.

**Responses to surveys.** From time to time, we may conduct online, phone and/or mail surveys. Our surveys may ask for information such as profile data or Member experience opinions. Depending on the nature of the survey, we may disclose survey results to third parties on an aggregate basis without restriction. We may also use this data to personalize our site so that you see content in which we think you might be interested.

**Communications with us.** You may contact us from time to time regarding matters related to your membership and the Services we provide. If you contact us by phone, email, or mail, we may keep a record of our communications with you, and use the information you provide so that we can respond to your inquiry.

**Choice/Opt-Out.** We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your Personal Data used for certain purposes in the "My Account" section of the PeoplePC Member site (<http://home.peoplepc.com/account>). For example, you may opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from PeoplePC, its merchant vendors or partners by updating the email preferences found in this section.

If you want to reduce the amount of national advertising mail you receive at home visit the [Direct Marketing Association's web site](http://www.dmaconsumers.org/consumerassistance.html) or send your name and address to: Mail Preference Service, Attn: Dept. 11097045, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 282, Carmel, NY 10512. A fee may be charged for online registration.

**2\. Usage Information We May Collect.**

**IP address.** We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our web sites, and to help identify you. We may use this information for such things as helping us to track the success of new features.

**Use of cookies.** Our site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, and to allow us to better understand how you like to use our site. For example, we might track which of our site pages you visit and save this information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. We also use cookies to save your Password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Cookies are stored on your computer hard drive, not on our servers. Cookies do not spy on you, and they cannot be used to breach the security of your hard drive and steal information. You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits.

Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies on their own sites. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

**Web Beacons.** Third party vendors who provide PeoplePC with reporting and email services employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as web beacons). Clear gifs are tiny, invisible graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs are only tied to your personal data for the purpose of tracking your initial registration, changes in account status and addition of account services. Clear gifs may be included in html emails for reporting purposes.

**Your use of the PeoplePC Sites.** In order to provide better service to you, PeoplePC monitors usage of the PeoplePC Sites. For instance, we may track hits to each of the pages in our site, the access numbers you are using, the length and time of your Internet sessions. PeoplePC and its e-commerce partners may also collect data on transactions you engage in on the PeoplePC sites and partner sites. We may share aggregated statistical information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors or other third parties, but none of them receives individual Personal Data about you collected at our sites. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a Web site but we would not disclose any information that would identify those individuals. We share this information only on an aggregate, anonymous basis and never on an individual basis, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.

**3\. Information Related to PeoplePC's Special Features.**

**PeoplePal Toolbar.** The PeoplePal Toolbar is installed as part of the PeoplePC software installation and automatically appears along with the Internet Explorer toolbar. It does not intentionally interfere with any other software program on your computer. URL visits and search queries made using the toolbar are not stored on our servers and are not transmitted to any third party. PeoplePC may track and statistically analyze the installation history and usage of the PeoplePal toolbar and its buttons in order to improve the functionality, content, or quality of the Toolbar. While you have the PeoplePal Toolbar installed, new versions may automatically be downloaded and installed on your computer. This keeps your software current and lets you use new features as soon as they are available.

**PeoplePages.** PeoplePages is a feature that allows you to create a special page on which you can voluntarily post information about yourself, including Personal Data. Your PeoplePage will be available to anyone surfing the PeoplePages site, including non-PeoplePC members. By posting Personal Data on your PeoplePage, you are assuming the risk that persons accessing the PeoplePages site may use or misuse such information. PeoplePC will not be responsible or liable for such use or misuse. In addition, PeoplePC may feature your personal PeoplePage (as one of our "Featured Pages" or otherwise) on the PeoplePages site. Information you provide on your PeoplePage may also be used to offer you an improved, more personalized PeoplePC experience.

**4\. Information Exchanged with Our Vendors.**

Some PeoplePC products and services are offered to Members in conjunction with third party vendors. For example, stock quotes and horoscopes on your PeoplePC home page are provided by a third party vendor. Vendors may need to create an account for you within their systems in order to provide you with their services. To allow this, we must pass on information about you to them. Vendors may also need to collect and maintain your personal information to provide continuous service. Our third party vendors have agreed to use your personal information only to perform their functions as PeoplePC vendor-partners. Our core partners include:

  * Telecommunications and email vendors who work with us to establish and manage member accounts, fulfill contest prizes and promotional rewards and administer surveys; and
  * Third party reporting service providers who collect anonymous usage information on our web site through the use of cookies or use clear gifs for the purpose of tracking your initial registration, changes in account status and addition of account services.



**5\. Information Exchanged with Merchant Partners.**

Once you are a Member, you may enjoy special deals through our merchants who wish to make special offers to PeoplePC Members. We may share with merchant partners aggregate information about PeoplePC Members.

We may also from time to time make your contact information available so that merchants may tell you directly about offers that you might find of interest. When we do so, we will typically use a third party fulfillment house that has agreed to keep the contact information confidential and to use the information only for the purpose of conducting the mailings in question. We will not give your contact information directly to merchants, nor make the information available to any third party for unrestricted use.

**6\. Information Exchanged with Other Partners.**

Many PeoplePC Members have co-branded Home Pages (also known as Personal Start Pages) that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated partners. PeoplePC may share non-identifying and aggregate consumer information with such partners in order to more effectively market our co-branded products or services offered to our Members.

If you have become a Member through a program sponsored by your employer or an entity with which you are affiliated (such as a club, association, frequent flyer or rewards program), you may be asked to provide your membership number to us so we may validate your eligibility for the program and also notify the partner that you have become a Member.

We may also give your name and contact information to such employer or entity so that it may communicate with you. We will not share any other information about you or your activities on the Internet with your employer or entity with which you are affiliated.

**7\. General.**

**Security.** Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use commercial industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location. There is no such thing as perfect security, and whatever the level of security, it is always possible that security breaches could occur. PeoplePC is not responsible for damages caused by the intentional wrongful actions of others that result in a breach of security.

**PeoplePC's commitment to children's privacy.** Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. You must be 18 to use the Services. PeoplePC does not attempt to ask or collect information from any person under the age of 18.

For information about tips, tools, age-appropriate or kid-friendly web sites and how to report online trouble, please visit [www.getnetwise.org/](http://www.getnetwise.org/).

PeoplePC recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending personal data to PeoplePC, or to anyone else online.

**Special circumstances.** PeoplePC may be required by law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities to provide Personal Data on individual users. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, PeoplePC may voluntarily share Personal Data with appropriate governmental authorities. In circumstances involving a breach of PeoplePC's Acceptable Use Policy, PeoplePC may share Personal Data with governmental authorities and with the companies that provide Internet connectivity to PeoplePC. PeoplePC may also disclose Personal Data where necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating PeoplePC's Acceptable Use Policy or any of the applicable user policies, to operate PeoplePC's services properly, or to protect PeoplePC or its Members.

**Changing/Removing information.** If you wish to have information you have provided to us removed from our records or changed please contact us at one of the addresses listed below, and we will use all reasonable efforts to accommodate your request.
