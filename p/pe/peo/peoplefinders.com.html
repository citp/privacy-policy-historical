              <li><strong>Authorized service providers</strong>: We may share your personal 
              information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services 
              on our behalf. These services may include sending direct and electronic mail,

              of our e-mails and/or those of our marketing partners and/or affiliates, you have 
              agreed to the terms set forth in our Privacy Policy, and agree that as a function 
              of opening, previewing or clicking on the advertising portion of our e-mails, you 
              will receive new or additional marketing communications from us, our marketing

              independently solicit and collect information, including personal information 
              from you, and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities 
              on those web sites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all 
              third-party web sites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically 
              located at the bottom of the web page you are visiting.<br><br>

            <li><strong>E-mail lists.</strong> Users may remove themselves from a specific 
              mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present at the end 
              of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one 
              list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.<br><br></li>

            <li><strong>Other Situations</strong>. We also may disclose your information:

                claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or

                sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, 
                or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information which

            </ul></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their 
           own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. 
           Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information 
           once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. 
           If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit

           aggregate or group data about PeopleFinders.com users for lawful purposes. 
           Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or 
           characteristics of PeopleFinders.com participants as a group, without disclosing 
           personally identifiable information. By opening a PeopleFinders.com account, you 
           agree to allow PeopleFinders.com to provide such aggregate data to third parties. 
           By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or 
           communication to any third party when PeopleFinders.com, in its sole discretion, 
           determines the disclosure to be appropriate. </p>

          <p><a name="d" id="d"></a><strong>4. <u>Third-party reports</u></strong> </p>

          <p>The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and 
           third party suppliers, and is beyond our control to edit, modify, or change. 
           You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly 
           or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in 
           connection with use of or reliance on any such information.</p>

          <p><a name="e" id="de"></a><strong>5. <u>How you can access your information</u></strong> </p>

          <p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and 
           update your personal information online by logging into your account 
           <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/">http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/</a>. 
           You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. 
           More information about how to contact us is provided below.</p>

          <p><a name="f" id="f"></a><strong>6. <u>Your choices about collection and use 
            of your information</u></strong> </p>

          <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may 
            result in you being unable to use certain features of our web site because such 
            information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations 
            presented to you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a 
            question; or initiate other transactions on our web site. </p>

          <p>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails 
            or newsletters from us by unsubscribing.  In every marketing e-mail communication 
            we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe 
            from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided 
            and following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe 
            requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee 
            that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may 
            obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing 
            program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should 
            ever receive another e-mail marketing communication from us, you will be able 
            to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. Unsubscribing from 
            one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing 
            lists. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail 
            communications, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without 
            offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>

          <p><a name="g" id="g"></a><strong>7. <u>How we protect your personal 
            information</u></strong> </p>

          <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural 
            measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access 
            and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal 
            information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. When users 
            submit information at our web site, their information is protected both online and 
            offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to us and access 
            to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The 
            servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure 
            physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, 
            and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure 
            Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL 
            encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they 
            are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every 
            reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission 
            over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant 
            that your information will be absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or 
            through our web site is at your own risk. </p>

          <p>Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for
            information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

          <p>To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user payment 
            method information, such as PayPay, Google Check-Out, etc.) is collected by us and/or 
            any of our partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in confidence and 
            will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without 
            the user's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PeopleFinders.com, 
            our partners, affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third 
            parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but 
            we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the 
            user's prior informed consent.</p>

          <p>We value your privacy and, upon request, can block your records from being shown in 
            many, but not all, of our search results. To do so, you should contact us by writing a 
            letter, signed by you (we do not accept any unsigned requests or substitute service),
