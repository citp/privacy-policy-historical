          <p>The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and third party suppliers, and is beyond our control to edit, modify, or change. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such information.</p>

          <p><a name="e" id="de"></a><strong>6. How you can access your information</strong> </p>

          <p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/">http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/</a>. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.</p>
          
          <p>You can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties when you first signup. You can also update your preferences accessing "My Account" and updating your settings, or by <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/contact-us.aspx">contacting us via email</a>.</p>

          <p><a name="f" id="f"></a><strong>7. Your choices about collection and use 
            of your information</strong> </p>

          <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our web site because such information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented to you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our web site. </p>

          <p>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing. In every marketing e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. You can also unsubscribe by logging into “My Account”, “Email Preferences” and Opting out of receiving promotional emails. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail marketing communication from us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. If you no longer wish to receive offers via phone, you may unsubscribe by logging into “My Account”, “Phone Offers” and Opting out as with e-mail offers above. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>

          <p><a name="g" id="g"></a><strong>8. Advertising and Remarketing</strong> </p>
           
          <p>We partner with third party ad networks, including Google, to either display advertising 
           on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners, 
           including Google, uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable 
           information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted 
           advertising based upon your interests. We will market or advertise our people search 
           services to those users of third party's site who have previously visited the 
           PeopleFinders’ site. This is called "Remarketing".  Generally, advertisements that 
           are part of our remarketing campaigns will be focused on our people search 
           capabilities. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving 
           you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the 
           Google advertising opt-out page by clicking  <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note this  does not opt you out of being served 
           advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p> 

          <p><a name="h" id="h"></a><strong>9. How we protect your personal 
            information</strong> </p>

          <p>We take industry appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. When users submit information at our web site, their information is protected both online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to us and access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or through our web site is at your own risk. </p>

          <p>Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> 
           for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

          <p>To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user payment method information, such as PayPal, Google Check-Out, etc.) is collected by us and/or any of our partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the user's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PeopleFinders.com, our partners, affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the user's prior informed consent.</p>

          <p>After receiving your letter, we usually complete the opt-out request within 7 to 10 business days. If you include a self-addressed envelope, we will send back a letter confirming that the opt-out was completed.</p>

  <p>This information will be kept confidential and is used to ensure complete suppression of your records. Or, if you would prefer, there is an online service that will remove you from certain public records databases, credit offers, and other lists. Please refer to <b><a href="http://www.optout.com/" target="_new">OptOut.com</a></b> (<b><a href="http://www.optout.com/" target="_new">www.optout.com</a></b>).
