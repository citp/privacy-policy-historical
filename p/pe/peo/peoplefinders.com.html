            have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose

            those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want
            to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to

            the demographics, usage, or characteristics of <span id="lblSiteName6">PeopleFinders.com</span>
            participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable

          <p><a name="e" id="de"></a><strong>5. <u>How you can access your information</u></strong> </p>

          <p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review
            and update your personal information online by logging into your
            account <a href="javascript:;" onclick="opener.location=&quot;/myaccount/default.aspx&quot;;">http://PeopleFinders.com/myaccount/default.aspx</a>. 
            You can also review and update your personal information by contacting
            us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.</p>

          <p><a name="f" id="f"></a><strong>6. <u>Your choices about collection and use 
            of your information</u></strong> </p>

          <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that
            may result in you being unable to use certain features of our web
            site because such information may be required in order for you to
            have personalized recommendations presented to you; register as a
            user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate
            other transactions on our web site. </p>

          <p>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional
            e-mails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing.&nbsp; In every marketing
            e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that
            allows the recipient to unsubscribe from that specific marketing
            program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the
            instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe
            requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot
            guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from
            us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through
            a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We
            can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail
            marketing communication from us, you will be able to remove your
            e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. Unsubscribing from
            one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from
            all marketing lists. We may send you other types of transactional
            and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements
            and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity
            to opt out of receiving them.</p>

                information</u></strong> </p>

          <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic
            and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information
            from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized
            employees are permitted to access personal information, and they
            may do so only for permitted business functions. When users submit
            information at our web site, their information is protected both
            online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very
            important to us and access to your information is strictly limited,
            and not accessible to the public. The servers in which we store personally
            identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment.
            We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and
            alteration of personal information under our control. Currently,
            we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect
            data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including
            credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted
            over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every
            reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data,
            no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
            secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be
            absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or through our
            web site is at your own risk. </p>
