  * to exercise our rights under Articles 16 and 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including our freedom to conduct a business and right to property.



To the extent that we process any sensitive personal data relating to you for any of the purposes outlined above, we will do so because either: (i) we are required by law to process that data in order to ensure we meet our ‘know your client’ and ‘anti money laundering’ obligations (or other legal obligations imposed on us); (ii) the processing is necessary to carry out our obligations under employment, social security or social protection law; (iii) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have made the data manifestly public. 

#### Unsubscribe

We may, from time to time, e-mail or post you information to make you aware of our other similar products and services which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive emails or post from us for these purposes, or if you want to be removed from our electronic mailing list you can either select “unsubscribe” from any of the marketing emails that we send or alternatively [contact us](http://www.peopleperhour.com/zendesk/redirectToZendesk). 

#### Anonymous data collected through this website

In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, our web server automatically logs which pages of our website our visitors view, their IP addresses and which web browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website. 

Our website contains hyperlinks to other pages on our website. We may use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages on our website our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally - it simply enables us to compile statistics about the use of these hyperlinks.

#### Links to other websites

This website may contain hyperlinks to websites that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party websites or any association with their operators. We do not control these websites and are not responsible for their data or privacy practices. We urge you to review any privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any personal data about yourself. 

#### Cookies

In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary "cookies" that remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e.: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.

#### Disclosure of your Personal Data

In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined in the “Use of personal data” section above, we may disclose details about you to: our affiliates; third parties that provide services to us and/or our affiliates, such as our lawyers; competent authorities (including courts and supervisory or other authorities); your advisers or where applicable, your employer; credit reference agencies or other organisations that help us make decisions and reduce the incidence of fraud; and other third parties that reasonably require access to personal data relating to you for one or more of the purposes outlined in the “Use of personal data” section above. 

Where you have chosen to connect your PPH account to your Facebook or LinkedIn account we may share, disclose, and transfer personal data to Facebook or LinkedIn, as applicable. This permission will be requested when you connect your accounts. If you have given this permission you may then disable this function at any time by changing your Facebook, LinkedIn or PPH account settings (as applicable). 

Where appropriate, before disclosing personal data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data and to comply with applicable law. 

Where you have consented, we may also share your personal data with other companies within our group of companies who may contact you about their products or services that may interest you. 

Please note that some of the recipients of your personal data referenced above may be based in countries outside of the European Union whose laws may not provide the same level of data protection. Those countries currently include Greece, India and the United States of America. In such cases, we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal data that comply with our legal obligations. To ensure this level of protection for your personal information, we typically use a data transfer agreement with the recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. A copy of these clauses are available by requesting our Supplier Data Protection Addendum from [privacy@peopleperhour.com](mailto:privacy@peopleperhour.com). 

#### Protection of your personal data

All PPH personnel accessing personal information must comply with the internal rules and processes in relation to the processing of personal data to protect them and ensure the confidentiality of such information. 

We have also implemented adequate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing. These security measures have been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the personal information, with particular care for sensitive information. 

Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal data, the transmission of data over the internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure. We endeavour to protect personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us. 

#### How long we keep your information for

We will hold your personal data on our systems for the longest of the following periods: (i) as long as is necessary for the relevant activity (which is typically 7 years); (ii) any retention period that is required by law or regulation; or (iii) the end of the period in which litigation or investigations might arise in respect of our activities. 

#### Your rights

You have various rights in relation to your personal data. In particular, you have a right to:

  * request a copy of personal data we hold about you
  * ask that we update the personal data we hold about you, or correct such personal data that you think is incorrect or incomplete
  * ask that we delete personal data that we hold about you, or restrict the way in which we use such personal data
  * object to our processing of your personal data
  * ask that we restrict our processing of your personal data; and
  * ask for the portability of personal data - receive the Personal Data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form and transmit it to another data controller.



To exercise any of your rights, or if you have any other questions about our use of your personal data, please contact us at [privacy@peopleperhour.com](mailto:privacy@peopleperhour.com).

#### Right to complain

If you are unhappy with the way we handled your personal information or any privacy query or request you have raised with us you also have a right to complain to a data protection authority in the place where you live or work, or in the place where you think an issue in relation to your data has arisen. A list of national data protection authorities can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).

We may modify or amend this privacy statement from time to time.

To let you know when we make changes to this privacy statement, we will amend the revision date at the end of this page.
