# This is the privacy statement for PeoplePower.org. | PeoplePower.org

This website is a hub for organizing and deploying ACLU volunteers. We do that using a variety of digital tools, such as tools for sending emails, scheduling events and allowing volunteers to communicate with one another. Each of these tools has its own privacy rules, determined by the individual vendors, and different from the rules here on this website. Where possible, you can see those other rules by reviewing the respective privacy statements of the various service providers (for example, when you use a communications service, or one of the scheduling tools). Some of the tools may use tracking devices, or otherwise automatically collect information about you. Some will disclose information about you to companies involved in the operation of the platform, or to other volunteers.

Any information you actively provide to this site, for example by typing in your own name, address or phone number, will be shared in at least some of those ways. That information will also be shared with the main database used by ACLU and its affiliates.

While you are on this site, however, information we automatically collect (such as your IP address and the referring URL), will only be used for purposes of operating this site. No tracking devices will be placed on your device while you are on this site, except by us or on our behalf, in either case for the exclusive purpose of operating this site.

To review, change or withdraw any information you have actively shared with People Power, please contact [info@peoplepower.org](mailto:info@peoplepower.org).

To review, change or withdraw any copies of that information that have been shared with the ACLU, you have the following options:

• Click on the link in the footer of any email you receive from the ACLU and use our preference center  
• Send e-mail to: [aclupreferences@aclu.org](mailto:aclupreferences@aclu.org)
