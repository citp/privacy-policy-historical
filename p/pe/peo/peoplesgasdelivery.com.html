    <p><i>(Revised August 9, 2012)</i></p>

    <p>Peoples Gas (also referred to as "we" or "us") is
    concerned about preventing unauthorized disclosure of customer information.
    We understand the importance you place on the privacy and security of information
    that personally identifies you or your account information. We refer to this
    information as "personal information." We want you to know what personal
    information we collect and how we use it. We have therefore adopted the

    check this policy frequently, as we may amend it from time to time to reflect
    changes in our services and our policies relating to customer information.
    Amendments will become effective at the time they are posted on our website.
    We will not provide notice of changes in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2 id="profile" class="newSection">Creating an Online Profile</h2>

    <p>If you create an online profile to access various services related to your
    residential account or other applications involving your business account on
    the website, you may be asked to submit personal information such as
    your account number, name, last 4 of SSN/FEIN and
    email address.  You may also be asked to submit additional personal information
    or financial information to use specific services. We will protect all
    information that you provide us on the website, as set forth below:</p>

    <ol class="siteSpacedList">
	    <li>The personal information you provide us enables you to access self-service 
	    options offered on our website. To better serve you, we may use your email 
	    address to contact you in response to inquiries, or provide you with 
	    energy-related information. This information will be accessible to anyone 
	    who has access to your email. You will have the option to opt out of email 
	    marketing messages at anytime.</li>
	    <li>In order to provide you with services offered on the website, or 
	    to complete transactions or requests initiated by you on the website, 
	    we may transfer you to a website operated by third parties that help 
	    us provide services to you. In such cases, we will have agreements with 
	    those parties under which they will agree to maintain the confidentiality 
	    of your personal information and to use it only for the purpose of helping 
	    us serve you. We only transfer or share information to those who have 
	    a privacy policy at least as stringent or substantially similar to 
	    Peoples Gas.</li>
	    <li>Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your personal 
	    information to third parties without your written consent (which consent 
	    may be obtained electronically, such as by email), unless we reasonably 
	    believe that the disclosure is essential to the conduct of Peoples Gas' business, 
	    including but not limited to where such disclosure is necessary to (a) 
	    comply with the law, legal process or our regulators, (b) collect unpaid 
	    bills, (c) enable Peoples Gas' 
	    employees or consultants to provide service to 
	    you and to otherwise perform their duties, (d) comply with interchange 
	    functions, (e) obtain and provide credit reporting information, or (f) 
	    resolve customer disputes or inquiries. We do not provide your personal 
	    information to third parties for the purpose of telemarketing, email or 
	    direct-mail solicitation.</li>
	    <li>You should protect the confidentiality of your username and password. 
	    You are responsible for all activity on the website accessed by your 
	    username and password. Access by Peoples Gas' employees or consultants to any 
	    personal information you provide is limited to only that necessary to 
	    provide the business service offered and to otherwise allow such employees 
	    or consultants to perform their duties.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We try to ensure that the personal information we maintain about
    you is accurate, current and complete. If you discover that your
    personal information is incorrect, not current or incomplete, you 
    should <a href="https://accel.peoplesgasdelivery.com/secure/auth/l/acct/ManageAccount.aspx">update your online profile</a>.</p>

    <p>Once you have logged in using your online profile, any account 
    information that you enter or that is displayed in your browser 
    window is secured using an industry standard security technology 
    known as Secure Socket Layer ("SSL"). By using SSL, we attempt to 
    safeguard the confidentiality of your personal and financial information. 
    Your browser must be capable of supporting SSL; please check with 
    your browser manufacturer for details.</p>

    <h2 id="visitor" class="newSection">Visitor Information</h2>

    <p>We do collect information about the website use, such as the number 
    of visitors to the website and the number of users that click on 
    certain links or services. For some applications, we link usage information 
    with the particular customer visiting the website. We use industry 
    standard software to create summary statistics of the usage data we 
    collect, which may then be used to highlight what our visitors find 
    interesting, to improve our website design specifications, to identify 
    system performance issues, and for other internal purposes.</p>

    <p class="centerAlign"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h2 id="address" class="newSection">Our Use of Your IP Address</h2>

    <p>An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that is automatically 
    assigned to your computer every time that you browse the Internet. When 
    you visit the website, our servers log your current IP address. We may 
    use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to 
    administer our website. Data gathered from logging your IP address is 
    not tied to your personal information and is not used to identify you.</p>

    <p class="centerAlign"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h2 id="cookies" class="newSection">Our Use of Cookies</h2>

    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard drive by 
    Web page servers. When you visit the website, our server may create 
    "session" cookies, making it more convenient for you to use our site by 
    verifying when you travel from page to page that you have signed up with 
    our online services.</p>
    
    <p>The website may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. 
    These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website 
    people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and 
    web searches.</p>
    
    <p>Peoples Gas and our partners also use 
    cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website and 
    applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Peoples Gas
    more convenient and personal.</p>
    
    <p>As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. 
    This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet
    service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and 
    clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer 
    the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information 
    about our user base as a whole.</p>

    <p>In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the 
    Peoples Gas website. When customers click 
    one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page 
    on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics 
    and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in 
    this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>

    <p class="centerAlign"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h2 id="links" class="newSection">Links to Other Sites</h2>

    <p>While browsing the website, you may encounter hypertext links to 
    other websites operated by third parties. These other websites may 
    send their own cookies to you, log your IP address, and otherwise 
    collect data or solicit personal information.</p>

    <p><b>We do not control 
    and are not responsible for what third parties do in connection 
    with their websites, or how they handle your personal information. 
    Please exercise caution and consult the privacy policies posted 
    on such websites for further information.</b></p>

    <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please
    <a href="https://accel.peoplesgasdelivery.com/secure/ssl/contact.aspx">contact us</a>.</p>
