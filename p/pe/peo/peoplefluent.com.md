Peoplefluent Privacy Policy

(Effective August 2011, updated July 2013)

The Peoplefluent companies (“Peoplefluent”) provide this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and disclose certain personal information online on [www.peoplefluent.com](http://www.peoplefluent.com/ "www.peoplefluent.com"), our other websites, and our hosted Web-based application services or related support services that link to this policy (“Sites”). By using the Sites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

TRUSTe's Privacy Seal

Peoplefluent has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe's program requirements ](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/fprivacy-programs-requirements.html)including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this web site and does not cover personal information collected through our applications.

Information We Collect

Peoplefluent may collect information on its own behalf on the Sites as described in this Privacy Policy. Peoplefluent provides Web-based application services, software and related support services to help our customers manage information about and provide services to their employees, potential employees, contractors and others.

The types of personal information we may collect about you through our sites include contact and identifying information (name, address, email address, phone and fax numbers, institution, title or job position), information about your interest in Peoplefluent products or services, information about your interest in newsletters, seminars, or other services that we provide (solely or jointly with others), information about any other transaction(s) between you or your organization and Peoplefluent and any other personal information that you may provide to us in an online form or through an email. Where we collect personal information through online forms, we will notify you of which fields are mandatory for the particular service or functionality you are requesting and which fields are optional. If you choose to provide information that is optional, we may use and disclose such information as described in this Privacy Policy. A visitor to [www.peoplefluent.com ](http://www.peoplefluent.com/)who is not seeking employment and not expressing an interest in purchasing products or services is not required to reveal any individually identifiable information such as name, address or telephone number.

Our customers may use our hosted application services to process data about their candidates, employees, contractors and agents. Personal data that Peoplefluent may maintain on behalf of our customers includes, but is not limited to, names, contact information, CV or resume, data of birth, national insurance numbers, social security numbers, compensation information, and race and ethnic origin. Peoplefluent does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customers. Such information is owned and controlled by the customer, and Peoplefluent receives such information merely as a processor on the customer’s behalf. We use such data only as authorized in our subscription agreements with such customers and in accordance with applicable law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security of their own user logins.

Testimonials

Peoplefluent posts customer testimonials on its Web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer’s name. Peoplefluent obtains the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our public Web pages please send your request to [Security@peoplefluent.com](mailto:Security@peoplefluent.com).

Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe by providing a functional unsubscribe mechanism in each email communication we send to users.

Financial Information

We may offer products or services and event or class registration for you to purchase online. To complete these online financial transactions, our sites may request personal information including contact information (such as name, title, email address or shipping address) and credit card billing information. Disclosure of this information is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our sites may request personal information from you in connection with surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Personal information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes, and may also be used to provide you with additional information about our products or services, or those of our selected business partners.

Cookies

Peoplefluent may use non-persistent cookies in conjunction with its hosted applications services. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie does not read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to maintain the context of an individual’s interaction with our Web site or with the hosted service application. You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. If you choose not to accept cookies, your experience at our Web site and at the hosted service application Web site may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. We do not use 3rd party cookies within our application.

Clear Gifs

Peoplefluent and our 3rd party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, ensure the checkbox for “Yes, I would like to be contacted with employment information” remains unchecked.

Log Files and Aggregate Information

Peoplefluent may record information that is not individually identifiable about how people access our Web sites. This information includes IP addresses (or the DNS name associated with it), the Web site from which you are visiting Peoplefluent and the Web software you are using. This information is used in the aggregate, without disclosure of any individually identifiable information, to administer our system and make improvements to our site and to report to our customers and prospects on our sites’ performance. We reserve the right to share aggregate and anonymous information with potential partners and other third parties without restriction.

Display Advertising and Retargeting Efforts on Third-Party Websites and Applications

Peoplefluent has implemented and uses Display Advertising across third party websites and applications opted into the Google Content Network. Certain Peoplefluent advertisements on third party websites and applications in the Google Content Network may be retargeted using Google Analytics. Retargeting means that third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a user’s past visits to our website.

How Can I Opt Out of Google Analytics for Display Network or Retargeting?

If you would like to be removed or blocked from Google Analytics For Display Network or from retargeting efforts there are several options:

·     Users can customize ad settings by using the  **[Ads Preferences Manager](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/%E2%80%8E)**.

·     Users can apply the Google Analytics opt-out browser add on located at  **[https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)**.

·     If you would like to opt out of a specific cookie, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt out page  **[http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)**.

Links

Peoplefluent’s Web site may contain links to other Web sites. Peoplefluent is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

Disclosure

We may disclose personal information as necessary or appropriate in connection with any of the purposes for which we use personal information, including to subcontractors or service providers that help host or support the sites or otherwise provide technical assistance, fulfillment companies that help us to provide requested products or services and business partners that help conduct seminars or otherwise provide requested products, services or information. We may use third party service providers to provide credit card processing on our site. We will share your credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide such processing services. We reserve the right to disclose personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In situations where we transfer personal information to these types of third parties, we require that such third parties must not use or disclose the information for any purposes other than those specified in this Privacy Policy, and that such third parties must maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the personal information. In situations involving the sale or transfer of all or part of the business, we will seek to notify users of the ownership change by way of a prominent notice posted on our Web site. We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and or in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. Peoplefluent does not share, sell, rent, or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

Security

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, Peoplefluent has adopted appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Data maintained by Peoplefluent is protected by computer security mechanisms including firewalls, encryption, monitoring software, data and network segmentation, and passwords. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If, during their employment, Peoplefluent employees acquire confidential or proprietary information belonging to Peoplefluent or its customers, such information is required to be handled in confidence and may not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties. Peoplefluent employees are also responsible for the internal security of such information. Peoplefluent provides information and training to all employees who have access to data maintained on behalf of Peoplefluent customers. Employees who violate Peoplefluent security and safe maintenance of data policies are subject to appropriate discipline including, but not limited to, termination. If you have any questions about our security practices, you can email us at [Security@peoplefluent.com](mailto:Security@peoplefluent.com).

Safe Harbor Compliance

Peoplefluent has been awarded the TRUSTe seal signifying our Privacy Policy and privacy practices comply with TRUSTe’s EU Safe Harbor program requirements which are consistent with the U.S. – EU  and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland.

Personal information may be transferred abroad (including outside the EU and Switzerland for our users in the EU and Switzerland) in connection with Peoplefluent’s provision of hosted application services and related support services to our customers. Peoplefluent strives to collect and use personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business and is self-certified to U.S. – EU and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in coordination with European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). For more information, see [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).
