 **Use**

This section describes some of the ways in which PeopleStrong Alt uses the information we collect. Please note that there may be other uses, which we would describe to you when we collect the information.

PeopleStrong Alt uses the information we collect about you to provide to the PeopleStrong Alt websites, services, and support. For example, if you provide information to us in a “Contact Us” form, we will use your information to respond to the request.

PeopleStrong Alt uses your information for event planning and management, including registration, billing, and ways to connect with other event attendees, or to contact you further about relevant products and services. Any information you provide about emergency contacts or dietary preferences would be used for your safety and health purposes.

We use the contact information we collect from you and information about your activity on our websites to send you information that we believe may be of interest to you, such as product announcements, newsletters, educational materials, and details on upcoming events. We also use it to send administrative information, such as notices related to products, services, or policy changes.

We use the information we collect to understand how our websites and services are being used and to make improvements. For example, we may use the search queries entered into PeopleStrong Alt Community to improve search capabilities or performance. As another example, we may use questions posted or comments on PeopleStrong Alt Community to enrich the content or help guide future enhancements to our products and services.

Your information also may be used to personalize your experience on our websites. PeopleStrong Alt or our services providers use website tracking technologies to display products or features that are tailored to your interests and to present advertising on other sites.

We may use your information to diagnose website technical problems, as well as to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate potential security issues, as well as fraudulent or illegal activity.

In some instances, we may combine the information you have provided to us with other publicly available information. We may also purchase data from third parties and combine this with information we have already collected. We use this combined information to update, expand, and analyse our marketing leads; identify new customers; and create more tailored advertising.

If you participate in a PeopleStrong Alt-offered education or training course, your enrolment and attendance information will be recorded to track and potentially report your participation and completion. For example, completion of PeopleStrong Alt certifications by a services partner may be visible to PeopleStrong Alt and our customers, and completion of a training course may also be visible to the entity making the training available to you. This registration and tracking may be conducted by third parties on behalf of PeopleStrong Alt.
