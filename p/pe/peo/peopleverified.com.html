    <h3 class="cgrn">Disclaimer</h3>
        While we use acceptable industry-standard practices to protect your information, no computer system or Internet communication is ever completely secure or error-free. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will be absolutely secure.
        

        <h2 class=".rbhdr2"><a name="share">When do we share your information?</a></h2>
        We do not share, rent, or sell your information except in the limited circumstances described below:
        <h3 class="cgrn">With Your Consent</h3>
        We will share your information when you give us permission; for example, when you use a third-party web client to access your account, or when you give us permission to make information public.
        <h3 class="cgrn">Within the Segmentic Family of Products</h3>
        Other Segmentic products may use your information, but only in ways that are consistent with this Privacy Policy.
        <h3 class="cgrn">To Provide Certain Services</h3>
        We use certain trusted third parties to provide certain services for us. We may share your information with these third parties, but when we do, we will only share the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the service. In addition, any third-party service provider we use is required to give your information the same protections that are outlined here in this Privacy Policy.
        <h3 class="cgrn">Public, Anonymous and Aggregated Data</h3>
        We may share or disclose information that is non-private, anonymously aggregated, or otherwise non-personal.
        <h3 class="cgrn">Business Transfers</h3>
        In the event that Segmentic is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The obligations of this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to the new entity after the sale or transfer.
        <h3 class="cgrn">Fraud and Abuse Prevention</h3>
        We partner with certain third party vendors to prevent fraud and abuse. When you make a purchase, we analyze your payment information and unique device identifiers (including, but not limited to, IP address, geographical location, browser and operating system settings, and device ID) to identify suspected fraudulent activity and block it. 
        <br>
        When we detect suspected fraud or abuse, we may share information associated with that particular transaction or event (including, but not limited to, payment information, email addresses, and unique device identifiers) with our security partners or law enforcement for further investigation. 
        <h3 class="cgrn">Legal Compliance and Harm Prevention</h3>
        We may preserve or share your information in the following circumstances:
        <ul>
            <li>When required by law, regulation, or legal request such as a warrant or subpoena</li>

            <li>To address fraud, security, or technical issues</li>
            <li>To protect Segmentic’s rights or property</li>
        </ul>
        Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party or government request to disclose your information. 
        <h3 class="cgrn">Advertising</h3>
        We may use third-party advertising companies to serve targeted ads when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personal information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 
        <br>
        While we do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement (for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.)
