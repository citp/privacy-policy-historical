# Privacy Statement: PwC

#### **Business contacts**

##### **Information collection​ ​**

We collect and use business contact details for individuals associated with existing and potential PwC clients to manage and maintain our relationship with those individuals. Like most businesses, we use a customer relationship management system (the “PwC CRM”) to store personal information about our business contacts. 

The collection of personal information about contacts and the addition of that personal information to the PwC CRM is initiated by PwC staff and may include name, employer name, title, phone, email and other business contact details. In addition, the PwC CRM may collect data from PwC email and calendar systems concerning interactions between PwC staff and business contacts. 

When we send you emails, we may use technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and whether the links contained within the message have been clicked on. We may combine information collected through these means with other information we maintain about you to measure interest in our specific offerings and email campaigns, improve our offerings to specific target audiences, and tailor our interactions with you.

##### **Information use**

We use this information for the following business purposes:

  * **Administering, managing and developing our business and services.** We may process personal information to run our business, including:
    * managing our relationship with clients; ****
    * providing services and customer support to our clients;
    * developing our business and services, such as identifying client needs and improvements in service delivery and learning more about a client relationship opportunity we or other PwC member firms have an interest in; ****
    * analyzing and evaluating the strength of interactions between PwC and a contact  (e.g., the PwC CRM uses an algorithm to help with this analysis, and the ranking is primarily based on interaction frequency, duration, recency and response time); ****
    * performing analytics, including producing metrics for PwC leadership, such as on trends, relationship maps, sales intelligence, and progress against account business goals; ****
    *  maintaining and using IT systems; ****
    * hosting or facilitating the hosting of events; and ****
    * administering and managing our website, systems, and applications.
  * **Providing information about us and our range of services**



Unless we are asked not to, we use client business contact details to provide information that we think will be of interest about PwC and our services. For example, we may send you industry updates and insights, information about other services that may be relevant to you, and invites to events.

Please review the **Your choices ** _ _**** section below for information about how you may unsubscribe from our mailing lists and exercise other rights.

##### **Information retention**

Personal information will be retained in the PwC CRM for as long as we have, or need to keep a record of, a relationship with a business contact. Personal information may be held for longer periods where extended retention periods are required by law, regulation, or professional standards and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights. 

##### **Information sharing**

We may share personal information with third parties as described in the **Information disclosure** section below.

In addition, our business contacts are visible to and may be used by other PwC member firms to learn more about a contact, client or opportunity they have an interest in.

#### **Corporate clients (and individuals associated with our corporate clients)**

Our policy is to collect only the personal information necessary for agreed purposes, and we ask our clients only to share personal information with us when it is needed for those purposes.  When we need to process personal information to provide our services, we ask our clients to provide the necessary information to the data subjects concerned regarding how PwC will process that personal information, as our clients are typically in the appropriate position to communicate this information to the data subjects (e.g., our clients’ employees or our clients’ customers).

##### **Information collection**

Given the diversity of services we provide to clients ([click here for information on our services](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services.html)), we process many categories of personal information, which may include:

  * Personal details (e.g., name, age/date of birth, gender, marital status, country of residence);
  * Contact details (e.g., email address, phone number, postal address);
  * Financial details (e.g., salary, payroll details and other financial-related details such as income, investments and other financial interests, benefits, tax status);
  * Job details (e.g., role, grade, experience, performance information and other information about management and employees); and
  * For certain client engagements, we may process sensitive or special categories of personal information (such as in performing know your client checks, which may involve us processing government identification documents that may contain biometric data).



Generally, we collect personal information from our clients or from third parties acting on the instructions of the client. 

##### **Information use**

We use the above personal information for the following business purposes:

  * **Providing professional services and products  
**We provide a diverse range of professional services ([click here for information on our services](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services.html)) and products. Some of our services require us to process personal information to provide advice and deliverables. 
  * **Security, quality and risk management activities**
    * Personal information may be processed as part of the security monitoring that we undertake to detect, investigate and resolve security threats — for example, automated scans to identify harmful emails (e.g., phishing attempts).
    *  We monitor the services provided to clients for quality purposes and risk management purposes, which may involve processing personal information stored on the relevant client file.
    * We collect and hold personal information as part of our client engagement and acceptance procedures, including carrying out searches using publicly available sources — such as internet searches and sanctions lists — to help identify politically exposed persons and heightened risk individuals and organizations and checking that there are no issues that would prevent us from working with a particular client — such as sanctions, criminal convictions, conduct or other reputational issues, including with respect to company directors.
  * **Complying with any requirement of law, regulation or a professional body of which we are a member**



As with any provider of professional services, we are subject to legal, regulatory and professional obligations. Subject to these obligations, and as described in the **Information retention** section below, we need to keep certain records to demonstrate that our services are provided in compliance with those obligations, and those records may contain personal information.

We are continually looking for ways to help our clients and improve our business and services.  Where agreed with our clients, we may use information that we receive in the course of providing professional services for other lawful purposes, including analysis to better understand a particular issue, industry or sector, provide insights to our clients, improve our business, service delivery and offerings and develop new PwC technologies and offerings.  To the extent that the information we receive in the course of providing professional services contains personal information, we will de-identify the information prior to using it for these purposes.

The visitor log is maintained by the receptionist and is only used for investigative or emergency situations.

We monitor traffic on our guest WiFi networks using industry standard intrusion detection systems. This allows us to see limited information about a user’s network behaviors but will include being able to see at least the source and destination addresses the user is connecting from and to.
