In order to properly manage our website and related email services, we may anonymously log information on our operating systems about the number and duration of visits to the website and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types, and to track document identification number by way of email acknowledgement or return receipt.  These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmaster and system administrators.  In addition, site statistics are compiled by third parties, and therefore your IP address will be passed to third parties for statistical reporting only.  This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.
