	<h1>PwC Privacy Policy</h1>
<b>Working Together</b><br><br>
This privacy policy applies to
PricewaterhouseCoopers (ABN 52 780 433 757) and any entity owned or
controlled by PricewaterhouseCoopers ("Related Entity") in relation to
PricewaterhouseCoopers' and its Related Entities' (together
"PricewaterhouseCoopers") operations in Australia. This policy explains
how PricewaterhouseCoopers handles personal information and complies
with the requirements of the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)
("Privacy Act"). If you have any further questions in relation to this
policy, please contact our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy.officer@au.pwc.com">privacy.officer@au.pwc.com</a>.<br><br>
This policy relates to
PricewaterhouseCoopers' collection and handling of personal information
that is covered by the Privacy Act. It is not intended to cover
categories of personal information that are not covered by the Privacy
Act.<br><br>
<b>Collection of personal information</b><br><br>
PricewaterhouseCoopers collects personal
information from clients, customers, employees, contractors and other
individuals. We collect this information when it is necessary for
business purposes.<br><br>
The main types of personal information
PricewaterhouseCoopers collects relate to the contact details and
organisational roles of our clients, suppliers and other business
contacts. Typically, this information includes names, addresses,
telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and job titles. In the course of
providing professional services to our clients, we may collect more
detailed personal information (for instance financial details if we are
engaged to perform financial services).<br><br>
We collect most information directly from
individuals when we deal with them. The personal information we collect
may be provided in forms filled out by individuals, face to face
meetings, email messages, telephone conversations or by third parties.
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that contact.<br><br>
<b>Use of personal information</b><br><br>
The main purposes in collecting personal information about individuals are:<br>
<ul><li>to provide our services;</li>
<li>to respond to an individual's request;</li>
<li>to maintain contact with clients;</li>
<li>to keep clients and other contacts
informed of the services we offer and industry developments that may be
of interest to them, and to notify them of service offerings, seminars
and other events we are holding;</li>
<li>for general management and reporting purposes, such as invoicing and account management;</li>
<li>for recruitment purposes;</li>
<li>for purposes related to the employment of our personnel and providing internal services to our staff; and</li>
<li>all other purposes related to our business.</li></ul>
We may use personal information about
individuals to market our services, including by email. However,
individuals always have the opportunity to elect not to receive further
marketing information from us by writing to The National Privacy
Office, PricewaterhouseCoopers, 201 Sussex Street, Sydney NSW 2000, or
by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy.officer@au.pwc.com">privacy.officer@au.pwc.com</a>. Please allow 28 days for your request to be processed.<br><br>
Alternatively, if we have contacted you by
email, you may use the unsubscribe function in that email to notify us
that you do not want to receive further marketing information from us
by email.<br><br>
If we collect or use personal information
in ways other than as stated in this policy, we will ensure we do so
pursuant to the requirements of the Privacy Act.<br><br>
Employee records are not generally subject
to the Privacy Act and therefore this policy may not apply to the
handling of information about employees by PricewaterhouseCoopers. For
information about our practices relating to employee information,
please contact us directly.<br><br>
<b>Disclosure of personal information</b><br><br>
PricewaterhouseCoopers does not routinely disclose personal information to other organisations unless:<br>
<ul><li>required by law;</li>
<li>use or disclosure is permitted by this policy;</li>
<li>we believe it necessary to provide
you with a product or service which you have requested (or, in the case
of a partner or employee of PricewaterhouseCoopers, it is necessary to
maintaining or related to your role at PricewaterhouseCoopers);</li>
<li>to protect the rights, property or
personal safety of any member of the public or a customer of
PricewaterhouseCoopers or the interests of PricewaterhouseCoopers;</li>
<li>some or all of the assets or
operations of PricewaterhouseCoopers are or may be transferred to
another party as part of the sale of some or all of
PricewaterhouseCoopers' business; or</li>
<li>you give your consent.</li></ul>
We may also share non-personal,
de-identified and aggregated information for research or promotional
purposes. Except as set out in this policy, we do not sell or trade
personal information to third parties, or allow such third parties to
use that personal information.<br><br>
PricewaterhouseCoopers uses a range of
service providers to help us maximise the quality and efficiency of our
services and our business operations (including internal business
requirements, such as recruitment and human capital requirements). This
means that individuals and organisations outside of
PricewaterhouseCoopers will sometimes have access to personal
information held by PricewaterhouseCoopers and may collect or use it
from or on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers. This may include, but is
not limited to, independent contractors and consultants, travel service
providers, mail houses, off-site security storage providers, website
hosts, electronic database managers, or event managers, credit managers
and debt collecting agencies. We require our service providers to
adhere to our privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or
use it for any unauthorised purposes.<br><br>
If PricewaterhouseCoopers' staff obtain
products or services offered by a third party pursuant to an agreement
or arrangement between that third party and PricewaterhouseCoopers,
such as a credit card provider, we may provide your personal
information to that third party, including information that relates to
your use of such services.<br><br>
<b>Transfer of information outside Australia</b><br><br>
As part of a global network of
PricewaterhouseCoopers firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers exchanges
information, including personal information, between our offices. As a
result, we may transfer personal information outside Australia to
countries whose privacy laws do not provide the same level of
protection as Australia's. PricewaterhouseCoopers may also use overseas
facilities to process or back-up its information. As a result, we may
transfer your personal information to our overseas facilities for these
purposes.<br><br>
However, any such transfer of information
does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your privacy and
the information remains subject to existing confidentiality obligations.<br><br>
<b>Privacy on Our Web Sites</b><br><br>
This policy also applies to any personal
information we collect via our websites, including pwc.com. In addition
to personal information you provide to us directly (such as where you
make a request or complete a registration form), PricewaterhouseCoopers
may also collect personal information from you via its websites.<br><br>
Cookies may be used on some areas of our
websites. A cookie is a small software application which allows a
website to recognise a previous user and to observe how a user
navigates within a website. Cookies are now used as a standard by many
websites. PricewaterhouseCoopers uses cookies to improve the
navigational experience of visitors to our websites and to make them
easier to use.<br><br>
If you are concerned about cookies, most
browsers now recognise when a cookie is offered and permit you to opt
out of receiving it. If you are not sure whether your browser has this
capability, you should check with the software manufacturer or your
internet service provider. In most cases, you can refuse a cookie and
still fully navigate the PricewaterhouseCoopers websites.<br><br>
In order to properly manage our websites,
we may log certain statistics about the users of the sites, for example
the users' domains and browser types. None of this information
specifically identifies an individual and it is used solely to ensure
that our websites present the best possible navigational experience for
visitors.<br><br>
Whenever a registered member (such as a
PricewaterhouseCoopers alumnus) logs in to our websites, they will be
identified by their user name and password. The information we collect
about members' use of our websites is used purely for measuring site
performance and in assisting to resolve any technical difficulties.<br><br>
Because PricewaterhouseCoopers wants your
website experience to be as informative and resourceful as possible, we
provide a number of links to websites operated by third parties.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is not responsible for the privacy practices or
policies of those sites. We encourage you to review each website's
privacy policy, especially if you intend to disclose any personal
information via that site. A link to another non-PricewaterhouseCoopers
website is not an express or implied endorsement, promotion or warranty
of the products or services offered by or accessible through that site
or advertised on that site.<br><br>
<b>Security of Personal Information</b><br><br>
Depending on the purpose for which we have
collected personal information (for example, registration for a
PricewaterhouseCoopers event or a request for particular information or
material), we may store some of the information electronically in
PricewaterhouseCoopers' customer relationship management system. Some
or all of this personal information may be available to partners and
authorised staff of PricewaterhouseCoopers for use in accordance with
this policy.<br><br>
PricewaterhouseCoopers will endeavour to
take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information which we hold
about you, whether electronically or in hard-copy, and to keep this
information accurate and up to date. We also require our employees and
data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal
information held by PricewaterhouseCoopers.<br><br>
PricewaterhouseCoopers aims to achieve
industry best practice in the security of personal information which it
holds. It is our policy to destroy personal information once there is
no longer a legal or business need for us to retain it.<br><br>
<b>Access to Information</b><br><br>
We will provide access to personal
information upon request by an individual, except in the limited
circumstances in which it is permitted for us to withhold this
information (for instance, where granting access would infringe another
person's privacy).<br><br>
When you make a request to access personal
information, we will require you to provide some form of identification
(such as a driver's licence or passport) so we can verify that you are
the person to whom the information relates. In some cases we may also
request an administrative fee to cover the cost of access.<br><br>
If at any time you want to know what
personal information we hold about you, you may contact us by writing
to: The National Privacy Office, PricewaterhouseCoopers, 201 Sussex
Street, Sydney, or emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy.officer@au.pwc.com">privacy.officer@au.pwc.com</a>.<br><br>
<b>Corrections and Concerns</b><br><br>
If you believe that information we hold
about you is incorrect or out of date, or if you have concerns about
how we are handling your personal information, please contact us and we
will try to resolve those concerns.<br><br>
If you wish to have your personal
information deleted, please let us know and we will take reasonable
steps to delete it (unless we need to keep it for legal, auditing or
internal risk management reasons).<br><br>
If PricewaterhouseCoopers becomes aware of
any ongoing concerns or problems concerning our privacy practices, we
will take these issues seriously and work to address these concerns. If
you have any further queries relating to our privacy policy, or you
have a problem or complaint, please contact our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy.officer@au.pwc.com">privacy.officer@au.pwc.com</a>.<br><br>
<b>Effect of Policy</b><br><br>
PricewaterhouseCoopers operates in a
dynamic business environment. Over time, aspects of our business may
change as we respond to changing market conditions. This may require
our policies to reviewed and revised. PricewaterhouseCoopers reserves
the right to change its privacy policy at any time and notify you by
posting an updated version of the policy on this website.<br><br>
The amended policy will apply between us whether or not we have given you specific notice of any change.<br><br>
This policy was last updated in October 2007.<br><br>
<b>Further information</b><br><br>
