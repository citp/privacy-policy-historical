# Privacy Policy | pcRUSH.com

As our customer, your privacy is important to us. We will never sell or share your personally identifiable information without your prior consent, except that which is necessary as described below. We gather certain types of information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. Third party companies may be used to facilitate fulfillment, shipping, marketing, customer service, payment processing, and other functions necessary to provide the most rewarding experience to our customers. Information shared with these companies is handled securely and with the highest degree of care. 

Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we gather and how we use them.

## Information That We Collect

pcRUSH.com collects two types of information from customers which are stored in a secure database: voluntary information (such as name, e-mail address, billing and shipping addresses, phone, and credit card information) and automatic information (such as number of visits and browser used).

## Voluntary Information

Voluntary information is personally identifiable information that our customers provide when registering with pcRUSH.com. It makes it possible for them to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided by pcRUSH.com. We also maintain a record of customer product interests and purchase history from our site in order to better supply products. This information is also necessary for us to process and ship orders, inquire our customers about purchases, and inform them about occasional special offers.

## Automatic Information

Automatic information is non-personally identifiable information that we receive and store whenever you interact with us. As with many other Web sites, we use "cookies" which are small data files stored on your computer. The information we receive when your Web browser accesses pcRUSH.com includes the following: 

  * IP address - to measure our site traffic, diagnose problems with our server and administer over our Web site.
  * Referral site - if you come to our site via a link from another Web site, the location of the referral is noted. This is used to help us know where some of our users come from.
  * Browser type - to help us optimize our site to match the latest technology used by our customers.
  * Number of visits - so we can offer special promotions to regular customers and provide a more personalized shopping experience.
