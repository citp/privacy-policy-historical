              <h1 align="center" class="style3"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
              <p align="left" class="style3">Your privacy is important to us. At  The PC Repair Shop we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <ul type="circle">
                  <li class="style3">We don't ask you for personal information unless we        truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your        gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
                  <li class="style3">We don't share your personal information with anyone        except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our        rights.</li>
                  <li class="style3">We don't store personal information on our servers        unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
                  <li class="style3">In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple        as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by        search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p class="style3">Below is our privacy policy which  incorporates these goals:</p>
              <p class="style3">                PCRepairShop.org ("<strong>The PC  Repair Shop</strong>") operates <a href="http://www.pcrepairshop.org/" target="_self">pcrepairshop.org</a>. It is The  PC Repair Shop's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we  may collect while operating our websites.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Website  Visitors</strong><br>
                Like most website operators, The PC  Repair Shop collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that  web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,  language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  The PC Repair Shop's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying  information is to better understand how The PC Repair Shop's visitors use its  website. From time to time, The PC Repair Shop may release  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a  report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
              <p class="style3">                The PC Repair Shop also collects  potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)  addresses. The PC Repair Shop does not use such information to identify its  visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the  same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying  information, as described below.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Gathering  of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
                Certain visitors to The PC Repair  Shop's websites choose to interact with The PC Repair Shop in ways that require  The PC Repair Shop to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and  type of information that The PC Repair Shop gathers depends on the nature of the  interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our forum at <a href="http://www.pcrepairshop.org/wordpress/">pcrepairshop.org/wordpress/</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with  The PC Repair Shop are asked to provide additional information, including as  necessary the personal and financial information required to process those  transactions. In each case, The PC Repair Shop collects such information only  insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's  interaction with The PC Repair Shop. The PC Repair Shop does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors  can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat  that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Aggregated  Statistics</strong><br>
                The PC Repair Shop may collect  statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, The PC  Repair Shop may monitor the most popular blogs on the <a href="http://www.pcrepairshop.org/wordpress/" target="_blank">PCRepairShop.org</a> site. The PC Repair Shop may display this information publicly or provide it to  others. However, The PC Repair Shop does not disclose personally-identifying information  other than as described below.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Protection  of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
                The PC Repair Shop discloses  potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only  to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i)  need to know that information in order to process it on The PC Repair Shop's  behalf or to provide services available at </p>
              <p class="style3">The PC Repair Shop's websites, and  (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,  contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home  country; by using The PC Repair Shop's websites, you consent to the transfer of  such information to them. The PC Repair Shop will not rent or sell potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other  than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described  above, The PC Repair Shop discloses potentially personally-identifying and  personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when  The PC Repair Shop believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably  necessary to protect the property or rights of The PC Repair Shop, third  parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a The PC Repair  Shop website and have supplied your email address, The PC Repair Shop may  occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your  feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with The PC Repair  Shop and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to  communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email  to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via  one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to  help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.  The PC Repair Shop takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against  the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
                A cookie is a string of information  that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser  provides to the website each time the visitor returns. The PC Repair Shop uses  cookies to help The PC Repair Shop identify and track visitors, their usage of  The PC Repair Shop website, and their website access preferences. The PC Repair  Shop visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should  set their browsers to refuse cookies before using The PC Repair Shop's  websites, with the drawback that certain features of The PC Repair Shop's  websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Ads</strong><br>
                Ads appearing on any of our websites  may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These  cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you  an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your  computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver  targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This  Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by The PC Repair Shop and does not  cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
              <p class="style3"><strong>Privacy  Policy Changes</strong><br>
                Although most changes are likely to  be minor, The PC Repair Shop may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,  and in The PC Repair Shop's sole discretion. The PC Repair Shop encourages  visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will  constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
