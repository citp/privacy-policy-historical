This Safe Harbor Privacy Statement (the Statement) sets forth the privacy principles followed by Main Sequence in connection with the transfer and protection of "personal information" received from the European Union (EU). 

The Statement is directed toward two classes of user: Account Owners and Public Users. 

Main Sequence has certified that our privacy practices comply with the Safe Harbor standards. Please be aware that Main Sequence is not responsible for the privacy and security practices of our customers. 

**ALL INFORMATION ENTERED INTO PCRECRUITER.NET IS THE SOLE PROPERTY OF THE MAIN SEQUENCE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT OWNER.**

**Main Sequence does not control or monitor the collection, use or disclosure of information collected from Public Users by Account Owners. Main Sequence expressly disclaims any and all liability related to any collection, disclosure or use of such information relating to Public Users. In addition, we encourage all site visitors to seek out and read the privacy policies of account owners and all sites visited on the Internet. Main Sequence is in the solutions hosting business and may host databases for account owners at website addresses other than[www.pcrecruiter.net](http://www.pcrecruiter.net/). **

The "Safe Harbor" program was jointly established in June 2000 by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission, as a method for transferring personal information from the European Union (EU), to companies in the United States. The program is a voluntary self-certification process for companies operating in the United States. Companies that certify represent that they are upholding privacy standards for personal information received from the EU that have been jointly accepted by the EU Commission and the US Department of Commerce. 

These standards exceed current US privacy standards. 

"Personal Information" means information that can directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a person, such as an individual's name, address, e-mail, telephone number, license number, medical identification number, photograph, or other identifying characteristic. The identification can occur by reference to one or more factors specific to the individual's identity. Personal information does not include information that has been encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal information. 

The following privacy principles apply to the transfer, collection, use or disclosure of personal information of Public Users and/or Account Owners from the EU by Main Sequence.  
.  
**Notice:** Main Sequence informs Account Owners in the EU about the purposes for which it collects and uses their personal information, how to contact Main Sequence, the types of third parties with which Main Sequence shares their personal information, and the choice and means Main Sequence offers for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. 

Consistent with the Safe Harbor requirements, Main Sequence may not be in a position to furnish notice in certain situations. Specifically, notice is not required where the processing of EU personal information is necessary to respond to a government inquiry; is required by applicable laws, court orders or government regulations; or is necessary to protect Main Sequence's legal interests and providing notice would interfere with those interests. Main Sequence provides copyright notices within its solutions to that Public Users may identify Main Sequence as the solution provider as a step toward contact with Account Owners. Main Sequence will make reasonable efforts to assure that Public Users can contact Account Owners when privacy concerns are presented. 

**Choice:** Main Sequence will not process personal information about EU Account Owners for purposes other than those for which the information was originally obtained or subsequently authorized by the Account Owner unless the individual affirmatively and explicitly consents ("opt-in") to the processing, or unless an exception applies. 

Main Sequence also Account Owners with the opportunity to withdraw consent at any time ("opt-out"), in which case their personal information will not be further processed. The use of any opt-out provision by itself will not alter or abrogate any contractual obligations between the parties. 

Main Sequence collects personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be processed. 

**Transfers To Third Parties:** Main Sequence will only transfer personal information about Account Owners or Public Users to third-parties where the third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to Main Sequence that it will protect the information consistently with this Statement; or (b) is located in the EU or a country considered "adequate" for privacy by the EU Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws; or (c) the third-party has also certified to the Safe Harbor, and is accordingly independently responsible for complying with the Safe Harbor requirements, excepting if a change occurs in Main Sequence's corporate structure, including without limitation, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, Main Sequence may, in its sole and absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information which it has collected and owns, including without limitation aggregated information and personally identifiable information of Account Owners, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. 

Where Main Sequence has knowledge that a third-party, including successor organizations, to whom it has provided EU personal information is processing that information in a manner contrary to this Statement or the Safe Harbor requirements, Main Sequence will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the processing. 

Upon written request to Main Sequence Main Sequence will provide EU Account Owners with an inventory of personal information held. Main Sequence will also take reasonable steps to allow Account Owners to review their information for the purposes of correcting their information. There are certain limitations to the Access and Correction rights, as set forth in the US Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website. 

**Security:** Main Sequence takes reasonable precautions to protect EU personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

**Enforcement:** Main Sequence has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to this Statement. Account Owners are parties to additional agreements with Main Sequence, which govern ownership and use of Information, dispute resolution, and other terms and conditions relating to the use of Main Sequence solutions. 

Main Sequence has also agreed to participate in the dispute resolution program provided by the European Data Protection Authorities. 

Adherence to these Privacy Principles may be limited to the extent required to meet a legal, governmental, national security or public interest obligation. 

Main Sequence complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Main Sequence has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

**Main Sequence Privacy Statement for Australia:**

As of March, 2014, important changes have been made to the Privacy Act 1988.   

The changes include a new set of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) that will regulate the handling of personal information by Australian Government agencies and businesses with revenue greater than $3 million (AUS), those trading in personal information, and all private health service providers.

In pertinent part, these changes include: 

**Personal information** is defined as ‘information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: 

•whether the information or opinion is true or not; and 

•whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not’ (s 6(1)). 

Common examples are an individual’s name, signature, address, telephone number, date of birth, medical records, bank account details, employment details and commentary or opinion about a person. 

**Sensitive information** is defined as a subset of personal information including: 

  * racial or ethnic origin 
  * political opinions 
  * membership of a political association 
  * religious beliefs or affiliations 
  * philosophical beliefs 
  * membership of a professional or trade association 
  * membership of a trade union 
  * sexual orientation or practices, or 
  * criminal record 
  * health information about an individual 
  * genetic information 
  * biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification or biometric identification, or 
  * biometric templates. 



In limited circumstances, providing personal information to a contractor to perform services on behalf of the APP entity may be a **use,** rather than a **disclosure.   **This occurs where the entity does not release the subsequent handling of personal information from its effective control. For example, if an entity provides personal information to a cloud service provider for the limited purpose of performing the services of storing and ensuring the entity may access the personal information, this may be a **‘use’** by the entity.  

Main Sequence is not responsible beyond a) the elements defined herein and b) the written agreement between Main Sequence and each customer for the customer’s compliance with the Privacy Act.   All relevant disclosures, measures, methods, and limitations of the act beyond the provision of Cloud services, in compliance with the Privacy Act, are the entire responsibility of the customer.  At all times, any Personal or Sensitive Information supplied to Main Sequence Technology remains in the effective control of the account owner.  In order to qualify for this definition of " **Use** ", the following circumstances will always apply to Australian customers of Main Sequence Technology: 

  * A binding contract between the customer and Main Sequence will require Main Sequence to only handle the personal information for the limited purposes selected solely at the discretion of the customer. 
  * The contract requires any subcontractors to agree to the same obligations, and 
  * The contract gives the entity effective control of how the information is handled by the provider, including the following: 
  * The customer retains the right or power to access, change or retrieve the information* 
  * The security measures taken by Main Sequence will be representative of similar measures taken by similar vendors of similar services at similar times. 
  * The information can be retrieved or permanently deleted by the customer when no longer required, or at the end of the contract. 

*In the event a customer account is intact, but suspended for non-payment or other mechanism of default, and the customer requests the ability to engage in activity related to compliance with the Privacy Act,  Main Sequence will a) make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate the request or b) immediately terminate the account and return all **personal information** to the account owner.  The final and complete destruction of personal account information will proceed with the general account data archive policies in effect at Main Sequence at the time of account termination.  All pertinent compliance requirements will remain binding on Main Sequence until such final destruction of account data.
