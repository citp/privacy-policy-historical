PCPartPicker, LLC (“PCPartPicker”) operates pcpartpicker.com. It is PCPartPicker’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. 

**Website Visitors**   
Like most website operators, PCPartPicker collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PCPartPicker’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PCPartPicker’s visitors use its website. From time to time, PCPartPicker may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

PCPartPicker also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the PCPartPicker website. PCPartPicker only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the PCPartPicker website. 

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**   
Certain visitors to PCPartPicker’s websites choose to interact with PCPartPicker in ways that require PCPartPicker to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that PCPartPicker gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at the PCPartPicker website to provide a username and email address. PCPartPicker collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with PCPartPicker. PCPartPicker does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

**Aggregated Statistics**   
PCPartPicker may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. PCPartPicker may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, PCPartPicker does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**   
PCPartPicker discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PCPartPicker’s behalf or to provide services available at PCPartPicker’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PCPartPicker’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PCPartPicker will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PCPartPicker discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PCPartPicker believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PCPartPicker, third parties or the public at large. PCPartPicker takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. PCPartPicker uses cookies to help PCPartPicker identify and track visitors, their usage of PCPartPicker website, and their website access preferences. PCPartPicker visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using PCPartPicker’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of PCPartPicker’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. 

**Business Transfers**   
If PCPartPicker, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that PCPartPicker goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of PCPartPicker may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. 

**Privacy Policy Changes**   
Although most changes are likely to be minor, PCPartPicker may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in PCPartPicker’s sole discretion. PCPartPicker encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
