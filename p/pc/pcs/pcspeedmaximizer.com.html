        <h2>Privacy Policy </h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Are you concerned about your privacy? Doing business together requires some   sharing of information. Set out below is our Privacy Policy, explaining what   information we collect and why, what we do with it and how we protect you.</p>
        <h2>What information we collect and why</h2>
        <p><strong>Registration, download and purchase</strong> <br>
          To access certain   areas of the Avanquest.com website (especially to download or to buy), you will   first be asked to complete a form to either download a trial version, a free   software title, or to create an account before buying any of our products.</p>
        <p><strong>Registration</strong> <br>
          During registration, you may be required to   provide your contact information, such as your name, email address, postal   address, payment information and to choose a password. <br>
          Your email addresse   is your username. We send all new registered visitors and clients a welcoming   email to verify their password and username. <br>
          It’s very important that you   submit a working email address because that that is where we’ll send your   purchase confirmation, download links, activation keys, support and product   notices. When an email address is not working, the associated password might be   deactivated by Avanquest.</p>
        <p><strong>Purchase</strong> <br>
          When buying a product on the site, you will be   asked for your contact details and billing and shipping information. This data   will be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card   verification process, and to ship the item(s) you ordered. If there is a problem   with the order, an Avanquest representative may contact you by email, phone, fax   or mail. A confirmation email is sent for each purchase to the address you give   us - so if you have a few addresses take a moment to remember which one you give   us.</p>
        <p><strong>Download</strong> <br>
          When downloading a trial version or a free   software program, you will be asked for contact information, including your   email address. You&nbsp;will receive email messages related to this transaction such   as to provide you with download links, activation keys, support notices and   upgrades for the software. </p>
        <p><strong>Surveys and contests <br>
        </strong>From time to time, we request   information from Avanquest.com users via surveys or contests. Participation in   these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. This information is mainly   used to better understand our audience and to send prizes to the winners when   needed. Should the results of a contest or a survey be published, no personal   information will be divulged without the explicit consent of the winners.</p>
        <p><strong>“Send to a Friend” Service. <br>
          </strong>To use our “Send to a   friend” services, you are requested to provide additional names and email   addresses. For these “Send to a friend” services, Avanquest.com sends an email   on your behalf containing links to the information you have selected on the   Avanquest.com website – and only in that specific context. None of these email   addresses&nbsp;are reused later, unless their owner subscribes by themselves to our   services. <strong><br>
          </strong></p>
        <h2>What we do with it</h2>
        <p><strong>Your subscription to Avanquest News and Special Offers</strong> <br>
          When submitting your email address, you are given the opportunity to   "opt-in" to the Avanquest newsletter.&nbsp; By opting to receive this communication,   Avanquest will send you regular emails containing relevant product and service   information, new product and upgrade information, and any special offers that we   think may be relevant to you.</p>
        <p><strong>If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter <br>
          </strong>If at any   time you wish to opt-out from these communications, please follow the   unsubscribe link contained in the emails, or <a title="Unsubscribe" href="mailto:unsubscribe@avanquest.com">email us</a> with your request to be   removed from our mailing list. <br>
          When you officially “unsubscribe” through our   links or site we commit to remove the email address from our mailing lists as   soon as possible, and usually before the next mailing. From that point you will   no longer&nbsp;receive our newsletters or special offers. However, please take note   that if you purchased software or downloaded trial versions in the past or if   you decide to purchase or download a trial version again after you’ve   unsubscribed, we may still send you service emails directly related to these   transactions, such as order confirmations, product notices, expiry   notifications, bug fix notifications, security alerts, compatibility   notifications, or enhancements.</p>
        <p><strong>No sharing of information to preserve your privacy</strong> <br>
