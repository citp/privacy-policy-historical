# Privacy Policy

Are you concerned about your privacy? Doing business together requires some sharing of information. Set out below is our Privacy Policy, explaining what information we collect and why, what we do with it and how we protect you.

### What information we collect and why

 **Registration, download and purchase**   
To access certain areas of the Avanquest.com website (especially to download or to buy), you will first be asked to complete a form to either download a trial version, a free software title, or to create an account before buying any of our products.

Registration   
During registration, you may be required to provide your contact information, such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information and to choose a password.   
Your email addresse is your username. We send all new registered visitors and clients a welcoming email to verify their password and username.   
It’s very important that you submit a working email address because that that is where we’ll send your purchase confirmation, download links, activation keys, support and product notices. When an email address is not working, the associated password might be deactivated by Avanquest.

Purchase   
When buying a product on the site, you will be asked for your contact details and billing and shipping information. This data will be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card verification process, and to ship the item(s) you ordered. If there is a problem with the order, an Avanquest representative may contact you by email, phone, fax or mail. A confirmation email is sent for each purchase to the address you give us - so if you have a few addresses take a moment to remember which one you give us.

Download   
When downloading a trial version or a free software program, you will be asked for contact information, including your email address. You will receive email messages related to this transaction such as to provide you with download links, activation keys, support notices and upgrades for the software.   


**Surveys and contests  
** From time to time, we request information from Avanquest.com users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. This information is mainly used to better understand our audience and to send prizes to the winners when needed. Should the results of a contest or a survey be published, no personal information will be divulged without the explicit consent of the winners.

 **“Send to a Friend” Service.  
** To use our “Send to a friend” services, you are requested to provide additional names and email addresses. For these “Send to a friend” services, Avanquest.com sends an email on your behalf containing links to the information you have selected on the Avanquest.com website – and only in that specific context. None of these email addresses are reused later, unless their owner subscribes by themselves to our services. **

### What we do with it

 **Your subscription to Avanquest News and Special Offers**   
When submitting your email address, you are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to the Avanquest newsletter.  By opting to receive this communication, Avanquest will send you regular emails containing relevant product and service information, new product and upgrade information, and any special offers that we think may be relevant to you.

 **If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter  
** If at any time you wish to opt-out from these communications, please follow the unsubscribe link contained in the emails, or visit our unsubscribe page by [clicking here](http://www.avanquestusa.com/support-aq/Remove.aspx).   
When you officially “unsubscribe” through our links or site we commit to remove the email address from our mailing lists as soon as possible, and usually before the next mailing. From that point you will no longer receive our newsletters or special offers. However, please take note that if you purchased software or downloaded trial versions in the past or if you decide to purchase or download a trial version again after you’ve unsubscribed, we may still send you service emails directly related to these transactions, such as order confirmations, product notices, expiry notifications, bug fix notifications, security alerts, compatibility notifications, or enhancements.

 **No sharing of information to preserve your privacy**

 **Notification of changes**

When we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a message on our homepage to that effect with a link to the revised Policy. In this way, you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances we may disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of email and you will be given a choice as to whether or not Avanquest Software may use their information in this different manner.
