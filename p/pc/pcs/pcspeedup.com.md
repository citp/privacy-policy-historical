The lawful bases we use for processing your data depends on the Services and Software you use. We collect and process your data when:

  * It is necessary to provide and operate the Services and Software we provide and to offer support and other necessary features. This is a Contract Basis.

  * To be informed about the collection of your personal information
  * To have access to your personal information
  * To have inaccurate personal information corrected

  * To object to your data being used for automated decision-making and profiling. Note: we do not do this but this is one of your rights under the GDPR regulation and is added for your information.



We want to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date and is being used not only in accordance with the law but with your full knowledge and cooperation.

#### Restriction – Contract Basis

When we collect information during purchasing of our goods and services this is collected on the lawful basis of ‘Contract’.  You cannot object to our collection of this information at this time but you can withdraw consent later and this does not affect your other rights.

However, a lot of the information we collect is anonymised (we cannot identify who the data came from) which means we can only send you information that we know to be yours.

Our Legitimate Interests Assessment is available on demand and includes our Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

In some cases, where a page on our website includes content from a social network, such as a Twitter feed, or Facebook comments box, those services may set a cookie even where you do not click a button. As is the case for all cookies, we cannot access those set by social networks, just as those social networks cannot access cookies we set ourselves.

## Security

The internet is not a secure medium. However, we take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. We have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy.

We use secure server software (SSL) to encrypt financial information you input before it is sent to us, and our database is hosted in a secure data centre. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use our best efforts to prevent this.
