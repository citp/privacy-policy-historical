## Log Files

As is common practice PCMonitors.info makes use of **log files from Google Analytics**. The information inside the log files includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet Service Provider (ISP), browser type, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. If you would not like your usage to be tracked in this way it is possible to [opt out of Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=None) and prevent tracking cookies being placed on your computer.

## Other Cookies

In addition to Google’s tracking cookies PCMonitors.info will place **temporary session identification cookies** on your computer if you log into the website to post on the forum or leave a comment. These are non-tracking cookies which we have no access to – they do not send any information to us or any third party. They are used purely to allow you to access the forums or to post comments without re-entering details such as your ‘post as’ name and anything else you typed into the comment form.

As explained in the subsequent section (affiliations), PCMonitors.info provides **links through to Amazon** in select posts, reviews and the recommendations section. These cookies automatically expire after 24 hours, and no personal information is gathered. The purpose of these cookies from our point of view is to allow Amazon to track any purchases you make after following any of the affiliate links on our website. This ensures that we are given any commission that is due.

PCMonitors.info has no access to or control over these third-party cookies and we are not able to see any personally identifiable information. [Further information on Amazon’s cookies can be found on this page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=footer_privacy?ie=UTF8&nodeId=468496).
