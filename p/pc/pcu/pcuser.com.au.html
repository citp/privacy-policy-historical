<b>ACP Publishing Pty Ltd Privacy Policy Statement</b><br>
<br>
<b>ACP and Privacy</b><br>
<br>
At ACP Publishing Pty Ltd ('ACP'),  we are committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy. As part of our normal operations we may collect your information. This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect and what may happen to that information.<br>
<br>
This policy applies to all publications published by ACP. It also covers websites relating to ACP publications hosted by third parties, including ninemsn.<br>
<br>
This statement is designed to tell you as much as possible about how ACP uses and manages personal information provided to, or collected by ACP. We believe you should be made aware of our practices so you can make informed decisions about how you allow us to use your information.<br>
<br>
ACP is bound by and supports the National Privacy Principles contained in the Commonwealth Privacy Act. As a media organisation, ACP publicly commits to the standards set out below under the heading "Media Organisation Privacy Standards" in relation to it acts and practices carried out in the course of journalism. <br>
<br>
In this ever changing world ACP may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy statement to take account of new laws and technology and changes to ACP's operations. All personal information held by ACP will be governed by ACP's most recent policy.<br>
<br>
Any questions regarding this statement or complaints regarding privacy should be sent to ACP's Privacy Officer at ACP Publishing Pty Ltd, 54-58 Park Street, SYDNEY  NSW   2001<br>
<br>
<b>What kind of personal information does ACP collect and how does ACP collect it?</b><br>
<br>
ACP collects a range of personal information from members of the public. <br>
<br>
ACP collects most information directly from you.  We collect this information so you can subscribe to publications, join our loyalty clubs, advertise in our magazines, request a product or service from ACP, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or an event, seek employment, or communicate with ACP by e-mail, telephone or in writing.<br>
<br>
Sometimes ACP may be provided with personal information about an individual from a third party, for example from third parties who give gift subscriptions.<br>
<br>
In general, the type of personal information ACP collects and holds could include (but is not limited to) name, address, contact details, and gender.<br>
 <br>
<br>
<b>How ACP uses Personal Information</b><br>
<br>
ACP uses personal information for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose.<br>
<br>
In general, ACP uses personal information for the following purposes:<br>

<ul type="disc">
<li>to provide publications to readers of its publications;
</li><li>to provide other products or services which are requested from ACP, including advertising services;

</li><li>to provide people with ongoing information about ACP's products and services in which they may have an interest;
</li><li>unless requested not to, ACP may provide your personal information to third parties which may in turn  provide your information  to other third parties for marketing purposes.</li></ul>
<br>
In many cases where ACP asks you to provide ACP with information about yourself, if you do not provide ACP with that information ACP will not be able to provide you with the relevant product or service.<br>
<br>

To the extent that ACP Websites contain links to sites operated by third parties and not related to ACP products, services or events ("Linked Websites"), the Linked Websites are not controlled by ACP and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those companies. Before disclosing your personal information to Linked Websites, we advise you to examine their privacy polices.<br>
<br>
<b>Ordering Third Party product</b><br>
<br>
When you order a product supplied by a third party supplier ("Third Party Supplier") through ACP or an ACP Website, we forward your contact information to the relevant Third Party Supplier. In those instances, your information will be governed by the privacy policy of the Third Party Supplier.<br>

<br>
ACP may decide to buy or sell assets which form part of or relate to its business. In any such transaction, personal information will usually be one of the transferred assets and will be disclosed to the purchaser.<br>
<br>
<b>How does ACP treat Sensitive Information?</b><br>
<br>
