### Banner Advertising & Tags

In addition to the list of cookies that we use on PC World, we wanted to take you through our use of advertising tags. We use tags from 3rd party suppliers dedicated to helping us improve the relevance of our advertising banners, both on our website and across the web where we have advertisements on other websites. Our advertising policy is designed to give you the most relevant adverts possible, based on your previous visits to our website and the things you looked at and/or added to your basket, so we can build a profile of what we think you might like to see on our website next time you visit. A tag is simply a way for us to identify if a specific page was viewed by a customer and use that information to form a more accurate advertising strategy. 

Many online businesses work with such partners as ours below in order to improve and personalise the experience their customers have of their website and brand advertising online. All reputable companies, such as those we choose to work with, have very strict policies around your privacy and the information captured. They do not collect any information that can personally identify you in any way. Almost all of these tracking tags can be disabled or opted out of. A website dedicated to helping you understand what networks currently use tracking tags on your machine is: 

<http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices>

### Privacy on PC World

Is shopping online with PC World safe?

At PC World, we care about security and make every effort to ensure our transaction process is safe and that your personal information is secure. 

We can assure you that every order you make on our website is safe. We use strict security precautions to make our website safe, including the use of a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server. Any information you enter while you're using the secure server is encrypted before being transmitted, so it is virtually impossible for an outside party to access or intercept your information. 

You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock icon or an image of a key in the bar at the bottom of your screen. Additionally, your web address should start with https: - the ‘s’ indicating it is a secure page. This should appear on any page where you are entering personal information, such as your payment card details. 

The latest versions of the most popular browsers, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Firefox support this secure connection. If for any reason this option has been disabled on your browser, you will not be able to transact or login until you reset these options. Find this option in your browser settings under security.

How do you protect my credit card details and personal information?

Our website is verified by Norton Secure, powered by Verisign to protect your personal data. Your payment methods are also covered through MasterCard Secure Code or Verified by Visa. 

For your additional security and to protect your personal information we request that you enter your password each time you wish to view a page containing your personal details. 

You can enrol your card in MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa scheme if you are not already a part of them. You will be able to set a private code for online transactions, giving you added protection against the unauthorised use of your credit or debit card online.
