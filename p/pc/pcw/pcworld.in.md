# PC World India: Privacy Policy

Collection of Information    
When you visit our website, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. For instance, while many areas of our website are free to all users, we do require registration for certain site services. If you decide to register for these services, or if you request information from us, you will be asked to provide certain information and details, including your name, company, designation, country and e-mail address. The information you provide helps us create customized content on our site. You will receive information only for the products and services that interest you.

    Our system also logs some basic and generic information about your computer, including its:  
• IP address (your computer's unique signature)  
• Operating system (e.g. Windows XP)  
• Browser software (e.g. Internet Explorer)

    We use this information about your computer to perform routine web site maintenance and to generate various aggregate reports for internal analysis, research and monitoring purposes, and to help us develop and enhance our web site and services for our users. 

    IDG India respects your privacy    
We will not sell, trade or rent personally identifiable information about our users to other parties, without obtaining their consent 

    We do, however, share certain aggregate information about our users with advertisers, i.e. XX% of site visitors are from India. This enables us improve our site, and provide services that are of value to you. 

    We also reserve the right to disclose user information in special cases. For example, when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing (or threatening to infringe) or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our title, rights, interests or property, or those of other web site users, or of anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose, without notice to you, personal information in response to a subpoena or other judicial order or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by any law, regulation or listing requirement, or by any stock/securities exchange, governmental or regulatory authority. 

    Use of information    
We may use the information you provide to respond to your requests for additional information, to contact you (if necessary) or for other administrative purposes. We may also access your information to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems, to enforce agreements between us, or for marketing purposes. 

    We may also use the information you provide, for certain mailing initiatives. For example, you may sometimes receive an invitation to answer surveys or try out new products and services from IDG India. Your feedback helps us improve our magazines and develop new products and services based on your needs. 

    You always have a choice about receiving mailings, surveys or information about products and services from us. Each e-mail you receive has an "Unsubscribe" option. As a registered member, you can also advise us which types of e-mail you wish to receive by updating your registration options. 

    Corrections of inaccuracies    
We are committed to providing reasonable and practical access to our users to identify and correct any inaccuracies in (or to update) the information provided. Users who have provided information on our web site can contact our Reader Services Department at [reader-service@idgindia.com](mailto:reader-service@idgindia.com), or use the relevant automated updating system (where applicable) to make corrections or updates. 

    Co-branded and alliance relationships    
We have established relationships with other parties on the Internet to offer you the benefit of other products and services, which we ourselves do not offer. We offer you access to these other parties either through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from our site, or through "co-branded" sites in which both ourselves and these other parties share the same URL, domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet. Generally, we do not own the co-branded and alliance parties, and we do not control how they use any information you supply them. It is therefore important that you understand their privacy policies and terms of use if you visit and use their sites. 

    Third party service providers    
Some services available through our website are "Powered by" or "Provided by" other third party content or technology service providers. We contract with these third party providers to help us provide you with better value and service. To fully access and use such services, you may sometimes be required to register for them, or to otherwise provide certain information and data. In order to provide you with the services in question, such information and data may have to be made available to the third party provider, who may then process or update such information and data and transmit them back to us. We are highly selective in choosing these third party providers, and they are allowed to use your information and data only for the purpose of and in connection with providing the services which we have contracted with them to provide.
