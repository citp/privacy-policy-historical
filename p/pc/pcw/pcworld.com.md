When DoubleClick is serving ads, it recognizes certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a user's IP address, browser version or type, operating system, service provider, and time zone. DoubleClick also uses cookies to note the general content of the sites you visit over time in order to serve ads on this site and other sites. Furthermore, PCWorld.com uses so-called "web beacons" (also referred to as "clear gifs" or "pixel tags") provided by Doubleclick to help manage our on-line advertising. These web beacons allow Doubleclick to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site. Although DoubleClick does share with PCWorld.com the non-personally identifiable information described above, such information is strictly in the aggregate.

The pages a user calls up on PCWorld.com and are noted by Doubleclick are not connected with personally identifiable information collected either at PCWorld.com or elsewhere.

PCWorld.com occasionally informs registered users and newsletter subscribers of special deals, new products, and other third-party product and service offers that it believes they will find interesting. PCWorld.com registered users and newsletter subscribers are given the option to choose whether they would like to receive such mailings upon registration. At any time you can request that your information not be used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to PCWorld.com at [webmaster@pcworld.com](mailto:webmaster@pcworld.com). Under no circumstances are e-mail lists made available to known spammers, get-rich-quick sites, or pornographic sites. 

PCWorld.com may also share personal information with third-party intermediaries--solely for the purposes of distribution--who will not store, retain, or use the information supplied to them. These intermediaries may include subscription service bureaus, credit card companies, and banks, or third-party providers of PCWorld.com services that the user selects at our site. Users are given the option to discontinue such services at any time, at which point the user's personal information will be automatically deleted from the service providers' databases.

What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
