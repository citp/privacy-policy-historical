## How and what information does search.pch.com gather or track?

We collect personal data from our users mainly during the initial registration process. Although some of the personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these services (e.g., an address is required to send prizes from search.pch.com), in some cases some of the information is optional. Users can determine to some extent what information they wish to submit. In addition to the initial registration process, we may, from time to time, ask users to answer optional questions about products and services. We gather this data in order to better understand our users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.

Through the use of "cookies" and "pixel tags"(both described below) and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data on, among other things, the following information: 

**Demographic**

**Technical**

| 

**Reference**

## What are Cookies?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users will find them on most major web sites, search.pch.com may place and store Internet cookies on a user's hard drive. Cookies can save any of the types of information noted above. Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on the search.pch.com site. For example, we use cookies to recognize user access privileges to search.pch.com, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services that we think may interest you, and estimate our audience size. We also use cookies to store user names and information that are supplied at registration. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas on the site will not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies. Some business partners such as advertisers may use cookies on our site. We have no access or control of third party cookies. 

"Pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests. For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their advertisement brought you to the search.pch.com site. If you visit our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party web site. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web site activity to us. 

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track usersÕ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

## Does search.pch.com disclose user information to third parties?

Except as otherwise noted in this policy, search.pch.com only discloses user information in aggregate form to marketing partners. For example, we might tell a marketing partner how many users visited search.pch.com over a period of time, but we will never tell them who it was that saw or clicked on their offer, unless that user has given us permission to do so. 

We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of Publishers Clearing House. We will not share personally identifiable information with third parties without your express consent or as described in this privacy policy. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average user visits this Web site or which other query words are most often used with the query word "camera." We will also release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, or change of control of search.pch.com, customer data would be considered a business asset and would be transferred. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information as required by law or to protect the safety and security of our users. 

We use other third parties such as a email service provider to provide mail delivery services on our site. When you register on our site, we will share your personally identifiable information as necessary for these third parties to provide these services.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.

## Can I opt-out of search.pch.com's data collection and/or distribution?

Receiving email messages from search.pch.com is optional. As noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution of personal data helps us create a more personalized, relevant, and intelligent web service for our users. While some basic data is necessary to provide certain services, such as entry into the sweepstakes through search.pch.com, there are some cases where the submission of information is optional. 

We will not contact you with e-mail offers or share personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent. You may follow the simple opt-out procedure of removing the check mark located at the permission notice box appearing on the search.pch.com registration and entry page. If you are already receiving search.pch.com emails and no longer wish to receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions that appear in every search.pch.com e-mail, or contact us through our "Help" page, or by writing directly to Christopher L. Irving, Senior Director of Consumer & Privacy Affairs, search.pch.com, 382 Channel Drive, Port Washington, New York, 11050. 

## What about external web sites?

To the extent hyperlinks or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks are utilized on this Site to access third party sites, users should be aware that these third party web sites are not controlled by search.pch.com and, therefore, are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that users check the privacy policies of these individual sites to see how their personal information will be utilized. 

## Does search.pch.com allow users access to their information for review and updating?

Users can access the personal information they have provided to search.pch.com for the purposes of reviewing and updating such information by following instructions in the "Profile" section of the Site.

## What does search.pch.com do to keep their site secure?

We have implemented a number of security features throughout the search.pch.com site that are intended to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to the user information we collect online. For example, database information is firewall protected. Also, only authorized search.pch.com personnel have access to any stored personal information we collect from our users. Users should be aware that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting any sensitive data. 

While we strive to create a secure and reliable site for our users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted over the Internet cannot be 100% guaranteed. Users should keep in mind that any information submitted through an Internet transaction is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without their consent. Search.pch.com is not responsible or liable for illegal interception of personal data via any Internet transaction.

## Does search.pch.com collect information from users outside of the United States?

The search.pch.com site is not directed to visitors residing outside of the United States Only US residents can register and qualify for the prizes. If search.pch.com becomes aware that a user, not residing in the United States has registered with the search.pch.com site, search.pch.com will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.

## Does search.pch.com collect personal information from children? 

The search.pch.com site is not targeted nor directed to children under the age of thirteen. Search.pch.com does not intend to collect personally identifiable information from individuals in this age group. If search.pch.com receives actual notice that a child under the age of thirteen has provided personal information to search.pch.com, pch.com will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.
