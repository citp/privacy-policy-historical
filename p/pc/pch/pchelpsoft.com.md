# Privacy Policy - PC HelpSoft

PCHelpSoft.com has created this policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the PC HelpSoft network of sites. 

### Our Privacy Guarantee

#### Information We Gather

PC HelpSoft collects two kinds of information about users:1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us.

  * When you purchase software or any other services from one of our websites, we will ask for additional information such as name, address, and credit card information. We will use this information as needed for your purchase. We will also store your name and email to contact you regarding your purchases or as needed in the future.

#### Cookies

As part of our approach to providing personalized services on our web site, we employ the use of cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server to be stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same  
page is visited. For example, a cookie is sent when you register or sign in to this site. With your consent, cookies can store information from forms you fill out to create a user profile so that you do not have to re-enter the information each time you visit.

We may also employ third party vendors, including Google to show our ads on sites on the internet and to use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website. These cookies do not store sensitive information such as contact details.

From time to time, we may also use Remarketing Dynamic Ads which use the Teracent cookie. Users may opt out of the Teracent cookie by visiting the [Teracent opt-out page](http://www.teracent.com/about-us/opt-out).

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it notifies you whenever a cookie is received so you can decide each time if you accept them or not. However, the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain features and choosing to reject cookies may reduce the functionality of the site.
