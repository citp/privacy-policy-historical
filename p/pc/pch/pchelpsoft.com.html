<h1>Our Commitment to Privacy</h1>


    <p>PCHelpSoft.com has created this policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the PC HelpSoft network of sites.    </p>
    <h3>Our Privacy Guarantee</h3><p>

We will never sell, rent or share any of your personal information with a third-party without your express prior permission. 

</p>

<h4>Information We Gather</h4>

<p>PC HelpSoft collects two kinds of information about users:
1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and
product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or
buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect
when users interact with us.</p>


<h4>Personal information</h4>

<p>We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send
information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific
use of your personal information varies, depending on how you
contact us:</p>

<ul class="leaf">
<li>When you subscribe to one of our newletters to
receive industry news or services or subscribe to one of our mailing
lists, you must provide your email address.  This information is
solely used to provide these services to you.</li>


<li>When you purchase software or any other services from one of our websites,
we will ask for additional information such as name, address, 
and credit card information.  We will use this information as needed for your
purchase.  We will also store your name and email to contact
you regarding your purchases or as needed in the future.  All information
relating to your credit card (credit card number and expiration date) is
discarded after your purchase and is not stored on our servers.</li>

<li>When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name,
address, and email address so we can administer the contest and
notify winners.</li>

<li>Any information you volunteer to us is used solely to provide
the specific services you requested.  We do not sell or rent any
information provided to us to third parties unless specifically noted
on the form you are filling out.  Please note, though, that our interactive
mailing lists may be archived by other third parties sites and that
if you contribute to this mailing lists (by posting an email message
directly to that mailing list), your information may be found in their
archives. </li>

</ul>


<br>
<h4>Log Files</h4>

<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
track user movement, and gather broad demographic information
for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally
identifiable information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>As part of our approach to providing personalized services on our web site,
we employ the use of cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.
A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server to be
stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same
page is visited. For example, a cookie is sent when you register or sign in
to this site. With your consent, cookies can store information from forms
you fill out to create a user profile so that you do not have to re-enter
the information each time you visit.</p>
<p>We may also employ third party vendors, including Google to show our ads on sites on the internet and to use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website. These cookies do not store sensitive  information such as contact details. At any time, users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page</a> or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;opt out page</a>.  </p>
<p>From time to time, we may also use Remarketing Dynamic Ads which use the Teracent cookie. Users may opt out of the Teracent cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.teracent.com/about-us/opt-out" target="_blank">Teracent opt-out page</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you
can configure your browser so that it notifies you whenever a cookie is
received so you can decide each time if you accept them or not. However, the
use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain features and choosing to
reject cookies may reduce the functionality of the site. Your browser help
should include precise instructions explaining how to define the acceptance
of cookies.</p>

<p>Our website also automatically captures IP addresses. We use IP addresses to
help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and to
help ensure the security of your interaction with the website.</p>

<h4>Services</h4>

<p>Our sites may contain many links to other sites. PC HelpSoft Software is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other
Web Sites.</p>


<h4>Contests &amp; Surveys</h4>

<p>We may run contests or surveys on our site in which we ask
our users for contact information (like their email address).
We use the customer contact information from the entry form
to send the user information about our company and its
products, or to contact them when it becomes necessary
(notices like updates, new features, etc.). Users may opt-out
of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section
below).</p>


<h4>Security</h4>

<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All
the data regarding customers, users, their computers' system
information and data are stored on a server. This server is
located in a locked and guarded space and only authorized
personnel have access to the database
containing the stored information.</p>


<h4>Uninstallation</h4><p>

You can uninstall the software application at any time through Windows Control Panel. To remove the software follow these steps: click on Start button, then Control Panel and open Add or Remove Programs. Highlight the application in the list and press Uninstall to remove it from your system.

</p><h4>Advertisers</h4><p>

We use an outside advertising company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 


</p><p>Some anonymous demographic data is shared with the advertising companies on an aggregate basis. 

</p><h4>Third Party Cookies</h4><p>

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique 'cookie' on your browser. 

</p>


<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>

<p>If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those
changes on our site.  If we decide to use personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that
stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users
via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of
their personal information.</p>

<h4>Choice/Opt-Out</h4>

<p>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications from us and from our partners at the point
where we request information about the user.</p>

<p>This site gives users the following options for removing their
information from our database so that they no longer receive
future communications or access to our other services:</p>
<ul class="leaf">
  <li>Email to privacy@pchelpsoft.com, stating your request.</li>
  <li>Our newsletters and mailings contain a link near the bottom of each mailing that can be used to automatically unsubscribe from that service.</li>
  <li>Reply to any unwanted communications that you receive, stating your request.</li>
</ul>
<br>
