Last Updated on March 10, 2005

At Future Network USA, Inc., a magazine publisher, we are interested in protecting your privacy. But sometimes we do need information to understand how to make our magazines more interesting, more specialized and more successful, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete privacy statement. 

**Collecting your Personal Information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (that is, your first and last name; your home or business address; your e-mail address; your telephone number; your gender) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, or if you subscribe to one of our magazines or elect to participate in a forum and/or a survey. Personal information collected by any of our websites often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service to you. 

For example: If you choose to subscribe to a magazine, we will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, and shipping information. 

**Use of your Personal Information**

We use your personal information for the following primary purposes: 

  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to special offers, updated information and other services. 
  * To help us determine if any modifications need to be made to our publications or with respect to our subscriptions.
  * To contact you regarding participation in a reader survey.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Certain services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Future Network USA and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

We may also on occasion share this information with third parties so that you may be informed of matters, services or products of interest to readers of our magazines.

We will sometimes allow other companies to offer our customers information about their products and services. If you do not wish to receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to **[webmaster@futurenetworkusa](mailto:webmaster@futurenetworkusa.com)**.com.

We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of any of our websites, or the public; and (d) comply with negotiated agreements in the event of a merger or sale of any of our products. 

**Control of your Personal Information**

We will occasionally allow other companies to offer our customers information about their products and services. If you do not wish to receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to webmaster@www.futurenetworkusa.com.
