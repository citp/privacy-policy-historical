# Privacy - Pennsylvania College of Technology

We respect your privacy. Pennsylvania College of Technology is the sole owner of information collected on this website. Any and all information collected via the Penn College website will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed. Exceptions exist only as mandated by law or required under a contractual relationship with a service provider as allowed by Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 

We may provide your personal information to organizations that provide services to help us with our business activities. These organizations are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services. In addition, we require all outside organizations that we work with in any area of our organization, including marketing and data processing, to maintain the confidentiality of your information in accordance with this privacy policy and to comply with all applicable laws.

## Information Collection

Penn College collects information at several different points on our website including, but not limited to:

##### Student Information System (SIS)

You will use your Penn College username and password to log in to SIS. Information obtained via SIS includes personal information such as addresses and home information, grades, and account/billing information. You are encouraged to protect the privacy of your login credentials throughout your college career. Sharing network usernames and passwords is a violation of [Penn College's Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/its/policy.htm).

##### Registrar

The Registrar's Office requires a student's Social Security number for the purpose of verifying the student's identity with official educational records. If a Social Security number is not provided, the College cannot guarantee the authenticity of educational records. The College will not disclose Social Security numbers to anyone outside of the College without an individual's consent except as mandated by law.

##### Admissions

We request information from the user on our Information Request form, as well as our degree-seeking, non-degree-seeking, and returning student admissions applications. The data requested by the Information Request form is used for recruitment purposes. The data requested by the admissions application is used for enrollment and billing purposes. An applicant may also choose to remit their application fee online. This transaction is secured by VeriSign. The Admissions Office also requests advance registration for special events, such as Open House, Senior Visit Day, New Jersey Days, and Campus Tours; this information is used both for planning and recruitment purposes.

##### Financial Aid 

We request information from the user on our Financial Aid Application form. While your Social Security number is not an admission requirement, it is required by the government in order for you to be eligible for aid.

##### Scholarships

We request information from the user on our Scholarship Application form. Our scholarship applications are hosted by NextGen Web Solutions. Applicants use their student ID number and a unique password (not the student's Penn College network password or SIS PIN) to log in. This information is contained on a secure server at NextGen.

##### Institutional Advancement

We request information from the user on our Online Giving form. The data requested by this form allows the user a more convenient; yet secure method of giving to Penn College. We accept online payment via credit card; this transaction is secured by Comodo. For those who wish to give to Penn College without submitting sensitive information, we also provide a printable form that can be mailed to the Institutional Advancement Office.

##### Alumni Information Update

Alumni Relations offers an Information Update form to maintain current contact information and supply information for [Class Notes](https://web.archive.org/oca/classNotes.aspx) published in _One College Avenue_. Alumni may elect to opt out of e-mail from the Alumni Relations office.

We have also asked alumni, on occasion, to act as ambassadors for the College, to appear and give testimony for our publications and website, and to offer tours during College events such as Open Houses.

We do not share contact information with anyone outside the College without permission.

##### "You're the Chef"

We request information from the user when the user chooses to ask a question of the Chef, and when the user chooses to submit an entry to our recipe contest. This information is used to determine the demographics of our audience, as well as to respond to questions, and to mail a prize to the winning entry of our recipe contest.

If a user elects to use our "Send this recipe to a friend" option for informing a friend about a recipe, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address only. We will send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time-only e-mail. 

##### College Store

The College contracts with Missouri Bookstore to provide online shopping cart technology for purchases. The user's e-mail address will not be shared with anyone, and the user will receive no correspondence unless it relates directly to a question or order. Missouri Bookstore uses secure SSL technology to secure all transactions.

#####  Workforce Development & Continuing Education

We accept online registrations for non-credit classes taught through our Workforce Development & Continuing Education office. The information is used solely for registration purposes. Also, because we accept credit card payment, this site is secured by VeriSign.

#####  Wildcat Wishes

We accept online orders for "Wildcat Wishes" student gift packages. Information obtained is used for ordering and delivery purposes only. Neither party's name will be placed on a mailing list. Credit card orders are protected, since the site is secured by Comodo.

##### Police

We request information from the user on our Student Vehicle Registration form, including vehicle license and credit card information. This transaction is secured by Comodo.

##### Employee Directories

While we do not sell or give out e-mail address information, that information is available on our website for the convenience of our students and employees. We do not publish a list of e-mail addresses.

#####  Student Directories

Student record information is confidential and private. In accordance with both federal law and College policy, the College does not publicly release student record information without prior written consent. The one exception to this is that the College will release directory-type information, such as name, address, phone number, date and place of birth, major, activity participation, date(s) of attendance, enrollment status, grade level, date of graduation, degrees/honors/awards, sports participation, and most recent educational institution attended. Any student may request that directory information not be released publicly by completing and signing an Authorization to Withhold Directory Information, available from the Registrar's Office. 

##### Site Search

The College uses Google Custom Search for providing customized search results. Submitted queries are not stored by the College; rather they are shared with Google for processing. Use of the Google Custom Search on the College’s website is governed by [Google’s privacy policy.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)
