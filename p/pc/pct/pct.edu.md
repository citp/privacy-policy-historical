We respect your privacy. Pennsylvania College of Technology is the sole owner of information collected on this website. Any and all information collected via the Penn College website will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed. Your information will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to.

### Information Collection

Penn College collects information at several different points on our website including, but not limited to:

**Student Information System (SIS) –** In order to use the SIS, you must first be assigned a personal identification number by the Registrar which will be used, along with your student ID number, to log in. Information obtained via the SIS includes personal information such as addresses and home information, student ID number, grades, and account/billing information. You are encouraged to protect the privacy of your PIN and student ID number.

**Registrar –** The Registrar's Office requires a student's Social Security number for the purposed of verifying the student's identity with official educational records. If a Social Security number is not provided, the College cannot guarantee the authenticity of educational records. The College will not disclose Social Security numbers to anyone outside of the College without an individual's consent except as mandated by law.

**Student Activities –** We request information for Parent and Family Weekend registration. This information is used for planning purposes. We accept online payment for activities and meals for this event. This transaction is secured by VeriSign.

**Admissions –** We request information from the user on our Information Request form, as well as our degree-seeking, non-degree-seeking, and returning student admissions applications. The data requested by the Information Request form is used for recruitment purposes. The data requested by the admissions application is used for enrollment and billing purposes. An applicant may also choose to remit their application fee online. This transaction is secured by VeriSign. The Office of Admissions also requests advance registration for special events, such as Fall Visitation, Spring Visitation, and Campus Tours; this information is used both for planning and recruitment purposes.

**Financial Aid –** We request information from the user on our Financial Aid Application form. While your Social Security number is not an admission requirement, it is required by the government in order for you to be eligible for aid.

**Scholarships** **–** We request information from the user on our Scholarship Application form. Our scholarship applications are hosted by NextGen Web Solutions. Applicants use their student ID number and a unique password (not the student's Penn College network password or SIS PIN) to log in. This information is contained on a secure server at NextGen.

**Institutional Advancement –** We request information from the user on our Online Giving form. The data requested by this form allows the user a more convenient, yet secure method of giving to Penn College. We accept online payment via credit card; this transaction is secured by VeriSign. For those who wish to give to Penn College without submitting sensitive information, we also provide a printable form that can be mailed to the Foundation.

**Alumni Information Update –** In an effort to keep a current listing of our alumni, we provide an Information Update form. This information is used for sending Penn College's award-winning quarterly, "One College Avenue," to all alumni, as well as periodic e-mail newsletters about upcoming events. Alumni may elect to opt out of these mailings.

We have also asked alumni, on occasion, to act as ambassadors for the College, to appear and give testimony for our publications and website, and to offer tours during College events such as Open Houses.

**"You're the Chef" –** We request information from the user when the user chooses to ask a question of the Chef, and when the user chooses to submit an entry to our recipe contest. This information is used to determine the demographics of our audience, as well as to respond to questions, and to mail a prize to the winning entry of our recipe contest.

If a user elects to use our "Send this recipe to a friend" option for informing a friend about a recipe, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address only. We will send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time-only e-mail.

**College Store –** The College contracts with CampusHub to provide online shopping cart technology for purchases. The user's e-mail address will not be shared with anyone, and the user will receive no correspondence unless it relates directly to a question or order. CampusHub uses secure SSL technology to secure all transactions.

**Workforce Development & Continuing Education – **We accept online registrations for non-credit classes taught through our Workforce Development & Continuing Education office. The information is used solely for registration purposes; we will not place the registrant on a mailing list unless requested to do so. Also, because we accept credit card payment, this site is secured by VeriSign.

**Wildcat Wishes –** We accept online orders for "Wildcat Wishes" student gift packages. Information obtained is used for ordering and delivery purposes only. Neither party's name will be placed on a mailing list. Credit card orders are protected, since the site is secured by VeriSign.

**Employee Directories** **–** While we do not sell or give out e-mail address information, that information is available on our website for the convenience of our students and employees. We do not publish a list of e-mail addresses.

**Student Directories** – Student record information is confidential and private. In accordance with both federal law and College policy, the College does not release student record information without prior written consent. The one exception to this is that the College will release directory-type information, such as name, address, phone number, date and place of birth, major, activity participation, date(s) of attendance, enrollment status, grade level, date of graduation, degrees/honors/awards, sports participation, and most recent educational institution attended. Any student may request that directory information not be released publicly by completing and signing an Authorization to Withhold Directory Information, available from the Registrar's Office.

**Student Home Pages** – We periodically monitor student homepages for content, and will discontinue hosting the home page of any student who is in violation of [Penn College's Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/its/policy.htm).

**Cookies** – A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, and contains information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. The cookie we use will stay on the user's hard drive. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site with no limitations. Cookies on our site are used solely for the purpose of tracking the progress of visitors to our site.

**Log Files/IP Addresses** – We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Penn College Student E-mail Addresses (yourname@pct.edu)** – We will not sell or give your Penn College e-mail address to anyone, except in a searchable format on our website. If you wish to be removed from our online searchable list, you may log onto Penn College's student e-mail system and remove yourself from the directory.
