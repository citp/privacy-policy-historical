<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<h2>Important information regarding the use of this site.</h2>
<p>
PUMA is committed to ensuring the privacy of your personal information and this privacy notice 
is designed to voluntarily comply with current privacy legislation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_ptitle">Collection And Use Of Personal Information</span><br> 
PUMA limits its requests for information to what is required to ensure accurate service. 
Most of the information we collect is very basic and is needed to complete a purchase or 
provide a refund. Examples of user information that may be collected may include your name, 
address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit-or debit-card information, a description 
of the item requested or purchased and the IP address of your computer.
</p>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">Navigation Information</span><br>
Even if you do not make a purchase on our site, we have the ability to track usage of our web 
site – including the server from which the site was visited. This information is not used to 
track information about individuals, but is used on an aggregate level to customize our site, 
improve the on-line experience and plan advertising and promotions. Information Voluntarily 
Provided<br>

There are times when you may provide information to us voluntarily. 
This occurs when you provide your feedback to us though e-mails, return forms, letters or 
telephone calls. We use this information to respond to your query and to keep track of customer 
feedback.
</p>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">Internet Database</span><br>
PUMA North America has created an Internet database 
to allow consumers to store their shipping and billing information, track the status of their 
order, list previous orders and retain email preferences. Registration is entirely voluntary and 
you have the ability to correct or delete the information at any time. This information is accessed 
through the "My Account" section of the site.
</p>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">Marketing Information</span><br>
PUMA does not sell or otherwise share your personal information with anyone else, such as 
advertising agencies or marketing companies. We only send marketing information to those 
customers who specifically sign up for our mailing list. Customers can opt-out of receiving 
information by using the "unsubscribe" option in any marketing e-mail that they receive or by 
changing their preferences in the "My Account" section of the site.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_ptitle">Disclosure And Retention Of Personal Information</span><br> 
PUMA will share your personal information internally with those staff members who need it to 
complete your purchase or carry out your instructions regarding the receipt of marketing 
information. We will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your 
written consent unless required to do so by law.

</p>
<p>
PUMA keeps your personal information for only as long as required to fulfill the purpose for 
which it was collected. In some cases, such as credit- or debit-card purchases, we are required 
by law to keep your personal information for a specified period of time. For those customers who 
have registered for the mailing list, their personal information is kept until we are notified 
that they no longer want their information stored. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_ptitle">Accuracy And Protection Of Personal Information</span><br> 
PUMA relies on our customers to notify us of any changes in personal information. 
Should inaccurate information come to our attention, we will investigate and correct the 
information and, if necessary, advise you of the change. Only those staff members who need your 
personal information in order to respond to your requests are given access to it. Employees are 
provided with training and information regarding the proper handling of personal information. 
All information stored in our computer system is protected from unauthorized access and information
that is stored in document form is kept in secure locations to prevent access by unauthorized 
persons.
</p>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">Transaction Security</span><br>
In order to make every effort to ensure that your experience at store.puma.com is secure, 
we use encryption technology to protect you against the loss, misuse or alteration of your 
personal information. When you fill out any contact forms or access your account, a secure 
server encrypts all of your information through the use of Secure Socket Layers (SSLs).
</p>
<p>
To be sure you're browsing secure pages for transactions, check your Web browser's status bar 
(located at the bottom of the window) for the closed padlock icon. This icon appears in your web 
browser to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page. Also, all browsers display an "s" 
after the "http" (https://) in the Web site address to indicate that you are in a secure environment

</p>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">PUMA.com Safe Shopping Guarantee</span><br>
We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing 
if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at store.puma.com. Under 
the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA), your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of 
fraudulent charges. For more information on the FCBA, visit ftc.gov. We will only cover this 
liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own 
from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your 
credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and 
procedures.
</p>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">Commitment to Children</span><br>
PUMA does not collect or maintain information from those people that we know are under 13 
years old and we do not specifically target this group in our marketing materials or other 
advertising.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<span class="puma_legal_ptitle">Access To Personal Information</span><br> 
PUMA is commented to ensuring that we have no personal information about customers that is 
not absolutely necessary in order to provide them with excellent service. We are also committed 
to ensuring that information about our customers is accurate and up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
In order to ensure compliance with these policies, PUMA has appointed a Privacy Officer to 
oversee all aspects of its privacy policies and practices. If you wish to know what information 
we currently have about you, or are dissatisfied with PUMA’s privacy policies or practices,
