_What are cookies?_

At various points on our website, we use "cookies." Cookies are small text files that the web browser stores on your hard drive. Cookies collect and store certain information which can be accessed by web servers.

_Cookies and personal data_

In general, no personal data is stored in the cookies that the PUMA Online Store uses. That way, none of the cookies can be attributed directly to you or anyone else without your prior consent. An identification number is assigned to a cookie when it is activated. So the cookie technology only supplies us with information of a user with a certain Cookie-ID (pseudonym). A combination of a Cookie-ID and personal data of the user (e.g. name, email address etc.) and thus a direct attribution of the information collected by or stored in the cookie to a certain user only takes place if the user has given his unambiguous prior consent.. For example, in order to facilitate secure online access so that you do not have to retype your user ID and password each time you visit the site, your user ID and password can be saved in cookies to make logging in to our website easier and faster.
