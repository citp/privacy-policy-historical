## Putnam privacy policy

  


  *   * Putnam's commitment to confidentiality 

In order to conduct business with our shareholders, we must obtain certain personal information such as account holders' names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth. Using this information, we are able to maintain accurate records of accounts and transactions. 

It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of our shareholder information, whether or not a shareholder currently owns shares of our funds. In particular, it is our policy not to sell information about you or your accounts to outside marketing firms. We have safeguards in place designed to prevent unauthorized access to our computer systems and procedures to protect personal information from unauthorized use. 

Under certain circumstances, we do share information with outside vendors who provide services to us, such as mailing and proxy solicitation. In those cases, the firms with whom we do business enter into confidentiality agreements with us, and we limit the information we provide them to only what is necessary to process transactions and perform other services related to your shareholder account. It is also our policy to share account information with your financial advisor, if you've provided us with information about your advisor and that person is listed on your Putnam account. 

If you would like clarification about our confidentiality policies or have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us at 1-800-225-1581, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

User consents to the transmission by electronic means of such information through any system, service, or product named or referred to in the preceding sentence; such consent shall be effective at all times that User uses any such system, service, or product. However, whenever User provides a login and password, the site entered will be a secure site.
