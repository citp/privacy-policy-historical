        <h4>How We Use Personal Information</h4>

        <p>The  Personal Information that you submit to us remains your property, but by  submitting such information to us you grant us the right, subject to applicable  state and federal law, to use the Personal Information (other than Sensitive  Information) for marketing purposes. Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise  distribute any and all Personal Information (other than Sensitive Information)  with/to any third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and  applicable law. These third parties may include, but shall not be limited to:  (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup  and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail  marketers; (c) telemarketers (where and to the extent permitted by applicable  law); (d) SMS text-based marketers (where and to the extent permitted by  applicable law); and (e) direct marketers.<br>
          We may  also use your Personal Information for any Services-related purpose, and/or  marketing and survey purpose, on our own behalf and on behalf of our affiliates  and subsidiaries. We may disclose Personal Information to third-party agents  and independent contractors that help us create and/or operate promotions and  surveys. You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any  other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection  with your continued use of the Site.<br>
          We are  able to offer the Services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached  by our third-party advertisers. Your Personal Information (other than Sensitive  Information) will be shared with advertisers on an aggregate and non-aggregate  basis. We also use contact information from your Personal Information to send  you information about the Services, our other offerings and to keep you  informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you and  to contact you about your billing account status. Please keep in mind, though,  that we do not control, and are not responsible for, the practices of our  third-party advertisers. If you wish to stop receiving future communications  from us and/or third party advertisers, or if you wish to prevent the transfer  and/or sale of your Personal Information to third parties (subject to  restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law), please see the  Removal of Your Information/Opting Out section below.<br>
          By  submitting your Facebook® account ID at the Site, you agree to grant us access  to your Facebook® profile for the sole and exclusive purpose of delivering  Member Content URLs (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) to your Facebook®  profile.<br>

          By  submitting your Personal Information at the Site, you agree to receive e-mail  marketing from us and our third-party advertisers. In addition, where you  submit a telephone number at the Site, if ever, you agree that such act  constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the  Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the "ATSR").  With respect to the ATSR, and notwithstanding that your telephone number may be  listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right  to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the terms of the ATSR.<br>
          In  addition, where you submit a mobile telephone number at the Site, if ever, you  agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, SMS  text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and  marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by  applicable law). As such, notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may  be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right  to contact you via SMS text-message based marketing in accordance with  applicable state and federal law. Further, you agree that we reserve the right  to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone  and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing  uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.<br>
          We  reserve the right to release current or past Personal Information: (i) in the  event that we believe that the Site and/or the Services is/are being or  has/have been used in violation of this Privacy Policy, the Terms and  Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (ii) if the information is subpoenaed or  otherwise requested pursuant to a valid legal proceeding; or (iii) if we are  sold or acquired. Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record  or communication to any third-party when we, in our sole discretion, determine  the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your  e-mail address with third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with  the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. Users should also be  aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the  authority under certain circumstances to permit Personal Information to be  shared or transferred to third parties without permission.<br>
          If you  enroll in certain Member programs, we may use your Personal Information to send  you a welcome email that may confirm your user name and password. In addition,  we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about Services and other  products, services, information and news that may be of interest to you, and  provide you with targeted feedback. In addition, if you identify yourself to us  by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use such information  (including Personal Information) to respond to your questions or comments, and  we may file your questions or comments for future reference.<br>
          We may  also supplement the information that we collect with information from other  sources to assist us in evaluating and improving the Site and Services, and to  determine your preferences so that we can tailor the Site and Services to your  needs.</p>

        <h4>Your IP Address</h4>
        <p>Each time  that you visit the Site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP  address and the web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help  identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use  your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the  Site and to better serve you in using the products, services and other features  associated with the Site.</p>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Cookies and Action Tags</h4>
        <p>Cookies:  The first time that a user provides an e-mail address in connection with  his/her activities at the Site, we assign an identification number to that  e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that user  comes back to the Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to  identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a  user provides other information in connection with his/her activities on the  Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that  information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may  use the information stored in our database: (a) to effectuate the purpose or  transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (b) to  pre-populate information fields in the event that the subject user wishes to  purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services,  promotions or other offers in the future; (c) to ensure that a user will not be  repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while  visiting the Site; and/or (d) to, in connection with regular communication with  a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or  are likely to be, of interest to that user. We also use cookies to anonymously  track and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience  on the Site. To find out more about cookies, please visit  www.cookiecentral.com. To disable and reject cookies, Click Here.<br>
          Action  Tags: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag)  is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain  advertisements or other information on the Site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images  embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information.  We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a  particular banner ad or visit the pages of the Site and to provide information  about what products/services are viewed or purchased. We reserve the right to  retain cookie and action tag data indefinitely. At no time will we share  cookie-related, action-tag-related and/or generated information and/or data  with third parties.</p>

        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>How We Use Demographic Information  and Aggregate Data</h4>
        <p>We use  demographic information to tailor the Site and/or Services to the interests of  our users. Demographic information is shared with third party advertisers so  that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience.  Demographic information may also be shared with other third parties.<br>
          We  reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about our users for lawful  purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics,  usage or characteristics of our participants as a group, without disclosing  personally identifiable information. By becoming a Member, you agree to allow  us to provide such aggregate data to third parties. By agreeing to the terms of  this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or  communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the  disclosure to be appropriate.</p>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Our Security Precautions</h4>
        <p>We  endeavor to safeguard and protect our users' information. The privacy of your  Personal Information is very important to us. The servers that we store  personally identifiable information in are kept in a secure physical  environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and  alteration of Personal Information under our control. When our  registration/application process asks users to enter Sensitive Information, and  when we store and transmit such Sensitive Information, that information is  encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL  encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we also do everything in  our power to protect all user information off-line and online. Unfortunately,  no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As  a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot  ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and  you do so at your own risk.<br>

          However,  access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the  public. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only  employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access  to Personal Information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security  and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering to our firm  policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable  federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory  agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with  respect to your Personal Information. Please be advised that notice may be  delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope  of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Minors</h4>
        <p>No  information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Site by visitors under  eighteen (18) years of age. Persons under eighteen (18) years of age are not  permitted to access the Site and we do not knowingly collect Personal  Information from such individuals. We encourage parents and guardians to spend  time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive  activities of their children.</p>

        <p>At your  request, we will remove Personal Information that you have provided to us. You  may do so by e-mailing us at abuse@putlocker.ch. However, deleting your  Personal Information, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from  us or third parties, will only change or delete the data in our database for  purposes of transacting future business on the Site and for managing future  communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not change or  delete Personal Information already collected as part of a particular  transaction in our database, which may have already been shared with third  parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy. You will need to contact  third parties who may contact you directly to change your preferences or your  Personal Information that they may be using to contact you.</p>
