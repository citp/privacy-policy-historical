Pulpo Media, Inc. Privacy Policy

Updated on March 2, 2010 

Pulpo Media, Inc. (“Pulpo”) is a technology-enabled marketing services company whose mission is to connect the growing U.S. Hispanic, Latin American, Spanish & Portuguese-language Internet populations worldwide with advertisers who are looking to reach them. Our clients include interactive content providers seeking to monetize their content (“Publishers”) and leading advertisers and advertising agencies seeking to dynamically localize and tailor their offerings to those Publishers and their audiences (“Advertisers”). For a full description of our company and our services please see our website at [www.pulpomedia.com](http://www.pulpomedia.com/). 

This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with clear and complete information about the consumer data we collect and the way that data is utilized. 

Collection of Non-Personally-Identifiable Information 

We deliver advertisements from various Advertisers across a network of Publisher websites. As part of our effort to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of Pulpo Media advertising, we utilize common tools such as cookies, web beacons and log files to collect and record data from browsers, advertisers and Publisher websites. 

“Cookies” are files that are stored on an Internet-enabled device and used to record anonymous click stream data such as: the date and time that that a website is visited, the IP address and browser being used to access that website, web pages visited or actions taken on the website, the content areas on web pages visited, the advertisements that appeared on those pages, and referring/exit pages. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to better analyze the composition of the audience we’re reaching, to provide you with more relevant advertising, and to limit the number of times your web browser receives the same advertisement during a unique browsing session. 

“Web beacons” or “clear gifs” are tiny graphic elements with a unique identifier used to track navigation and browsing behavior on a website or collection of sites. These web beacons, about the size of a period, are embedded on web pages. 

“Log files” record actions that occur on websites and collect data, including but not limited to the IP address of the user, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and advertisements viewed. 

In order to improve performance, we augment the data we collect with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from Publishers. This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender, language preference and income range. 

We may utilize the aggregated anonymous data described above to target or filter advertisements shown on our network. In an effort to better customize the sort of advertisements delivered. 

Opting-Out of Information Collection 

You can opt-out of having Pulpo collect non-personally identifiable information about you by clicking [here](http://www.tentaculos.net/opt-out/). When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. This opt-out cookie tells our system not to collect your non-personally identifiable information. The opt-out process is computer and browser specific and so must be repeated on each computer and from within each browser that you use (for example, from within Internet Explorer and Firefox). Please note that deleting, blocking or otherwise restricting cookies on your computer may delete our opt-out cookie and require you to renew your opt-out choice. 

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information 

We may collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from you in connection with lead generation and fulfillment services that we provide on behalf of some of the advertisers in our network, This information is collected when you voluntarily complete an online form, such as a survey, contest entry, or request for information about an offer advertised through our network or when you purchase something through an offer delivered through our network. Your PII may be transferred directly to the advertiser associated with the offer you are responding to or it may be stored on our computer systems to enable us to fulfill the offer on behalf of the advertiser in question. You will always be notified if your PII is being transferred to the advertiser associated with the offer you are responding to and we will not share your PII with any other party without your explicit consent. 

We may store any personally identifiable information that you choose to provide to us, such as your name, email address or phone number, when you communicate with our company via our corporate website. If you are one of our Publishers, we will store your account information and history in electronic non-public files on our system. 

Information Security 

Pulpo Media employs appropriate measures to ensure the security of data we collect. We routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities to improve our practices.

Information Collected by Third Party Sites

Such information may include non-personally identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information that you elect to provide by registering and/or transacting business on such website.
