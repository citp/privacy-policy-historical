COOKIE POLICY

This Pulpo Sites may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the Sites. Cookies are small bits of information that Pulpo places on your computer. Pulpo uses the cookies to identify your Internet browser, store your preferences, and to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Services. Cookies also help our Sites to recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor. This information allows us to customize delivery of information.

Pulpo is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Pulpo Sites or for the privacy practices of third parties or Internet advertising companies.

To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, see their individual websites.

GOOGLE ANALYTICS

Pulpo uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Sites analyze how users use the Sites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Sites will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.
