# Privacy Policy | Pulpo Media

## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

We collect information, including PII and Non-PII, when you interact with us and the Sites.

 **Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)**  
We collect Non-PII, for example, when you are browsing a Site with advertisements that we delivered, or when you click on one of these advertisements. We also collect Non-PII when you visit our websites or interact with us, for example, in connection with online surveys, contests or other online promotional activity administered by us. We may also obtain PII and make it Non-PII, for example, by removing personally-identifiable elements (such as names) or by aggregating PII with information about other individuals, in order to “anonymize” or “de-identify” the information. We may also augment the PII and Non-PII we collect with information from other sources, including, for example, zip code, age, gender, language preference or income range, in order to generate aggregate information that reflects activities, habits, preferences, or interests about our users as a group. This Privacy Policy does not apply to additional information that we collect from other sources.

 **Personally-Identifiable Information (“PII”)**  
We collect PII that you voluntarily provide to us, for example, when you:

  * • complete an online form, such as a survey, contest entry or other promotional activity;
  * • request information about an offer advertised through our network;
  * • enter into a transaction through an offer delivered through our network; or
  * • request services from advertisers on whose behalf we provide fulfillment services or place online ads.



In some cases, if you choose not to provide PII you may not be able to engage in these services.

 **Sensitive Information and Protecting Children**  
We do not knowingly collect, use or share any financial account numbers or social security numbers for purposes of online behavior advertising without your specific consent.

We do not knowingly collect “personal information,” as defined in the _Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act_ (“COPPA”), from children under the age of 13 or from Sites directed to children under the age of 13, nor do we engage in online behavioral advertising directed to children we have actual knowledge are under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian, we urge you to participate in your child’s online and mobile activities and to use parental control or other Internet and mobile filtering technology to supervise your child’s access to the Internet. If you believe that we may have obtained information relating to your child who is under the age of 13, please contact us immediately at [privacy@pulpomedia.com](mailto:privacy@pulpomedia.com).  
 

## HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

As a general matter, we may use information that we collect or combine it with other information, for example, in order to:

• advertise and market products and services of third parties outside the Company with whom we do business (“Business Partners”), including:
    \- to present content that is tailored to your interests, including online behavioral advertising;
    \- to analyze the effectiveness of advertising, promotions, and offers;
• conduct research and analysis, product development and reporting, including to:
    \- better understand our audiences;
    \- produce data analytics, statistical research and reports;
    \- review and change our products and services
• manage fraud and risk management, including to
    \- detect and prevent fraud or criminal activity;
    \- safeguard the security of your information;
• use it in other ways as required or permitted by law or with your consent.

Except where required by law, we may use Non-PII in other ways without restriction.  
 

## HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The Company may share PII or Non-PII with Business Partners so that they may market and advertise their products and services, administer and manage transactions and relationships with audiences, and personalize user experiences for audiences.

The Company may share PII or Non-PII with our outside vendors and other contractors who need to access such information in order to perform services for us (including, for example, fulfillment or administration of transactions, orders, contests, sweepstakes and prizes, data processing and storage, market research, reporting, hosting and technical support and other purposes).

The Company may share any PII or Non-PII that we collect if doing so is required by law or, in our belief is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with the law or legal process or cooperate with law enforcement; (2) protect the safety and security of users or members of the public; (3) protect or defend the legal rights of the Company, its employees, agents, advertisers, publishers or other contractors (including enforcement of agreements); (4) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (5) protect the rights, property or safety of the Company or the public. Except where required by law, we may share Non-PII in other ways without restriction.

The Company may share any information that we collect with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are controlled by, or under common control with, the Company. In addition, we may transfer any information that we collect as part of our assets if we (or parts of our business) are sold or transferred to a third party (including, without limitation, in the event of a merger, acquisition, event of bankruptcy or other transaction or reorganization).  
 

## INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES

Please be aware that the Sites on which we place advertisements may independently collect PII or Non-PII from you and may contain links to sites operated by third parties. PII and Non-PII collected by any third party sites are subject to the privacy policies of such third parties, which may differ from our Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of Sites operated by any third party. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of any site or application that you visit or use.  
 

## OPTING OUT OF INFORMATION COLLECTION

You can opt-out of having the Company collect or use information about you for online behavior advertising by [clicking here](http://www.tentaculos.net/opt-out/ "Click Here!") or going to the website [www.tentaculos.net/opt-out/](http://www.tentaculos.net/opt-out/ "Click Here!") and following the instructions, and we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out process is computer, device and browser specific and therefore must be repeated on each computer, device and browser that you use (for example, from within _Internet Explorer_ and _Firefox_ ). Please note that deleting, blocking or otherwise restricting cookies on your computer or device may delete our opt-out cookie and require you to renew your opt-out choice.

Many browsers can be modified to prevent automatic acceptance and notify you every time a cookie is sent to you or to allow you to choose not to receive cookies at all. If you wish to change the settings on your browser to block cookies, please follow the instructions applicable to the web browser that you are using.

## SECURITY AND RETENTION

We employ reasonable measures to protect the security of information that we collect. Unfortunately, no transmission of information and no data storage can be guaranteed to be completely secure and unauthorized access to data, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any such information, and you provide any information at your own risk.

We retain PII for as long as necessary to fulfill the delivery of advertising; administer transactions; conduct research and analysis, product development and reporting; comply with the law or legal process; protect or defend the legal rights of the Company, its employees, agents, advertisers, publishers or other contractors (including enforcement of agreements); protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; protect the rights, property or safety of the Company or the public; or as required or permitted by law or with your consent. We may retain Non-PII indefinitely.

A business may comply with this law by: (1) having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information for third parties’ direct marketing use unless the customer has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information for third parties’ direct marketing use if the customer has opted out to prevent his/her personal information from being shared for direct marketing use; AND (2) notifying the customer of his/her right to opt out and providing a cost-free means for the customer to exercise that right.
