This Privacy Policy applies to when you access or use any information or content appearing on pulpitandpen.org, whether as a “Registered User” or as a non-registered user just browsing pulpitandpen.org (a “Visitor”). This Privacy Policy also explains what type of information is collected if you visit third party websites serving content tagged by Publishers or Advertisers with Clean Media Code. We may change the Privacy Policy from time to time. Please consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates.

We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity. Check the privacy policies of websites tagged with our ad agency’s code for information regarding the applicable privacy practices.
