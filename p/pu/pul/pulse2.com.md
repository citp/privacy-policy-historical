This privacy policy governs pulse2.com, a website owned by Pulse 2.0 LLC. At Pulse 2.0, we fully understand the importance of your privacy and we strive to respect your privacy.

## **SUMMARY**

Pulse 2.0 may collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our website (pulse2.com). We may use this data to better understand our users. We may also ask you to provide certain personal information, but you’ll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we promise to fully respect your privacy. It is Pulse 2.0 LLC’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## **HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION  **

Like most website operators, Pulse 2.0 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pulse 2.0’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use its website.

Pulse 2.0 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Pulse 2.0 does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

Certain visitors to Pulse 2.0 choose to interact with Pulse 2.0 in ways that require Pulse 2.0 to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pulse 2.0 gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Pulse 2.0 collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Pulse 2.0. For example, if you provide us with your email address to sign up for our newsletter, we will only use your email address to send you our newsletter. Pulse 2.0 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities on Pulse 2.0.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user’s name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.
