####  5\. How We Share Information We May Collect 

We occasionally hire other companies to assist Us in providing products or services, handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, customer billing, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. 

We may disclose any information We collect from you if We believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with any law, judicial proceeding, government request, court order, legal process, rule or regulation or any process served on Us; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MMSOFT Design Ltd.

We reserve the right to transfer the personal information We have collected as part of that transaction or proposed transaction, provided that such third party agrees to maintain procedures no less protective than those found in our Privacy Statement. 

  


####  6\. Accessing And Changing Your Personal Information 

Depending on the relevant jurisdiction, you may have certain rights granted to you by law with respect to the personal information Pulseway and others have collected about you. For example, if the GDPR applies to the data We have collected about you, you have the right to access and correct data We have about you, to object to the processing of data, and to request that any information we have about you be erased. 

You may request to exercise these rights by managing your account through the online portal or by emailing our data privacy team at dpo@pulseway.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe, but no later than one month after you submit the request.

####  7\. Third Party Sites and Services 

Related offerings with links from Pulseway’s websites have their own privacy policies that can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. All Pulseway partners are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. 

However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of those third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties. 

Our web site also includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site, therefore your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of those third parties. 

  


####  8\. Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information 

Pulseway does not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the respective jurisdiction. If Pulseway learns that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete that information from our systems. 

  


####  9\. Cross-Border Data Transfers 

We are in the process of obtaining certification with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland. For more information about Privacy Shield, visit [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/ "https://www.privacyshield.gov"). 

  


####  10\. Security 

Pulseway takes information security seriously and uses reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access. When you place orders on our websites, all of your order information, including your credit card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. TLS technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. We use a variety of security technologies depending on the situation to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, such as physical access controls, TLS, Internet firewalls, and network monitoring. However, no security system is 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your information or assume liability for improper access to it. If you use a password to help protect your information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential, change the password frequently and use a strong password. We strongly recommend that you do not share this password with anyone. 

  


####  11\. Data Retention 

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at dpo@pulseway.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

  


####  12\. Communication Preferences 

You can stop delivery of promotional e-mail or other Pulseway communications by contacting Pulseway at dpo@pulseway.com. Additionally, when you purchase products or services from Us, We may deliver non-promotional communications related to those products or services which may not be canceled unless you cease use of the product or service. 

  


####  13\. Changes to this Statement 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If We make material changes to this Statement, We will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on Our home page prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of Pulseway’s products, services or websites or communication with Pulseway constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
